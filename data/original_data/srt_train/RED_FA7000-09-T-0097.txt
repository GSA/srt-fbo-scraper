background check.  Contractor employees found in violation of this process will be immediately removed from Academy grounds, are subject to
barment, and will not be allowed to re-enter until completion of the CAB process.
           (ii)  Convictions.  Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years shall constitute
indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer (CO), with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require denial of

the installation.
                   IV) The CO may require the contractor to restrict the employee’s use on this contract until the case is resolved.

                    V) Actions that involve barment do not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract

employee requiring access to the installation to perform work cited in the contract.  All contractors require issuance of a CAB from the Pass
and Registration Center (PRC).  CABs will be issued to contractors performing duties on USAFA as identified on the USAFA Form 111 and who
require weekly access to the installation for a period of time exceeding 7 days.  If required access is less than 7 days, contractors are issued
an AF Form 75, Visitor Pass.  CABs will be issued for a performance period not to exceed one year.
      (2) Added:  The CO, Contract Specialist (CS) or Sponsoring Official will endorse the USAFA Form 111 and the individual requiring the badge
will hand-carry the original USAFA Form 111 to the PRC for processing.  Badges processed by contractors themselves will not be accepted.
Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their CABs in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on
the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the contractor’s employees from accessing the installation(s) until CABs are obtained.
The CO will maintain a copy of all USAFA Form 111s accomplished for each contract for accountability of badges issued.
(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel
and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to work site.
      (1) Added:    CABs shall be returned by the contractor to the PRC within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to
the work site.
      (2) Added:   Contractors are required to submit a letter to the CO immediately after employee(s) being terminated or otherwise leaving
their employment on a contract.  The letter shall contain the names(s) of the individuals(s) with their social security numbers. The CO will
endorse the letter and forward it to PRC.  The contractors shall collect CABs and return them to the PRC within 5 days.
      (3) Added: At the end of each performance period (i.e. options) and at the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall submit a letter
to the CO containing the number of badges issued on each contract, the names of the individuals with their social security numbers, and identify
those badges being returned.  The CO will verify the names and number of badges on the letter utilizing their copy of the USAFA Form 111.  The
CO will maintain a copy of the letter and forward the contractor’s original letter to PRC.  By endorsement of the letter, the PRC will notify
the CO of receipt of all badges or of any discrepancies.
      (4) Added:  Denial of Access of Contractor Employees.  The Government reserves the right to deny access of contractor employee(s) for
substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons.  This action
does not relieve the contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.
(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101,
Volume 1 Air Force Installation Security Program and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, Paragraphs 3.24 and 3.27.
