SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT ARTICLE C.1. STATEMENT OF WORK
a. I. Background Information and Objectives A. Background Information The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) was established in 1974, and in 1992 it became part of the National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services. NIDA's mission is to "...lead the Nation in bringing the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction." NIDA supports over 85 percent of the world's research on the health aspects of drug abuse and addiction. NIDA-supported science addresses the most fundamental and essential questions about drug abuse, ranging from the molecule to managed care, and from DNA to community outreach research. NIDA conducts single and multi-site clinical trials through grants, contracts and cooperative agreements in sites located across the nation and in other countries. These are usually studies of behavioral, pharmacological, and integrated behavioral and pharmacological treatment interventions in rigorous, clinical trials to determine efficacy, effectiveness, practicality, and feasibility across a broad range of treatment settings and diversified patient populations and to transfer research results to physicians, clinicians, providers, and patients. These studies could be Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and/or Phase IV type trials. They may also include registry type trials or surveys. NIDA is currently looking for a data and clinical research organization to support and provide resources in managing and carrying out multiple trials in drug abuse research. We are seeking systems, procedures, and expertise for data management and statistical support. The systems will be used to support data analysis, information exchange, scientific discovery efforts and clinical evaluation of promising new anti-addiction therapies and companion behavioral interventions in order to further NIDA's mission. B. Objectives The contractor will provide resources to support NIDA in its goal of conducting multi-site clinical trials to test the effectiveness of new science-based drug abuse treatments in community settings. The clinical trials performed will be Phase I, Phase II and Phase III/IV medication trials and/or stage II and stage III behavior therapy trials. The studies will be carried out in multiple sites across the country in a variety of treatment settings. Actual clinical trials will not be conducted under this contract. Activities under this contract will support the trials carried out under various funding mechanisms. II. Services to be Performed A.

ordered the minimum amount as set forth in SECTION B, NIDA is not obligated to make additional purchases for services under this contract. 4. Transition Period - If a transition period is necessary to provide an orderly transition to a subsequent contractor, the work to be performed during the last ninety (90) days of a task order period of performance will consist of the following: a. At least 90 days prior to the completion date of a task order, the incumbent contractor shall submit to the COR and Alternate COR, a written transition plan that will ensure a secure and orderly transfer of all contract-related materials to another successor contractor or the Government. This plan shall include provisions for transferring all computer files, computer programs including all source codes, study supplies, records, and all written documentation for all studies and for general operating procedures.

b) Commit staff members to participate in all activities of relevant NIDA committees, subcommittees and workgroups as needed. Task 7. Provide other expert consultation and support services The contractor shall provide, at the direction of the COR or the Alternate COR, expert subcontractors and/or consultants to provide expertise in certain fields, and to make agreements with them. NIDA may require experts to perform additional services relating to study design and analysis, compiling and editing of clinical data, and other services related to clinical trials operations that might be required but not yet identified. Some of these tasks may include: a. Common Data Elements Provide a variety of support for medical record development for a consensus-based, standardized core set of CDEs on drug use disorders to support clinical decision support, clinical performance measures, and interoperability in vendor electronic (EMR) products and SUD clinical research. Coordinate and collaborate with other contractors as necessary to ensure compatibility with other systems in use by NIDA. NIDA's efforts to develop CDEs for substance abuse have been directed first to developing a hierarchy for domains, sub-domains and core questions, which have then been reviewed at workshops and symposia to obtain feedback by experts in clinical care and clinical research across a broad range of stakeholders in the federal government, state government, community treatment providers, large health care providers, primary and specialty care practitioners as members of various professional organizations, and vendors of electronic medical record products. NIDA EHRs CDEs development team will continue collecting transforming questions and permissible values sets used on case report forms used in the NIDA trials into metadata CDEs. These CDEs will be expert generated and consensus based and will be housed in the NCI's Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR), a metadata database built to conform with ISO-11179, the international standard for the creation, storage, and transfer of metadata. The CDE development team also works to standardize the proposed question text and/or permissible values to meet identified standard reporting requirements to limit the variability of questions and increase the data aggregation potential. The Team then creates metadata representations of each CRF in the caDSR Form Builder tool, providing users with a programming interface to allow content to be downloaded and used to build either the frontend or backend database for the electronic data capture system. NIDA has developed a panel of core data elements for research, including clinical trials, grants, and epidemiological studies. Preparation of CRFs to capture these core data elements either as a separate series of CRFs or embedded within trial/study specific CRFs will be included. The Core Data Elements will be taken from common data elements housed on the PhenX website and include from 20-160 items including demographics; body mass index; quality of life; HIV risk status; tobacco use; alcohol use; substance use; socioeconomic status; family history for nicotine, alcohol, and substances; co-morbidity, peer/partner use; and social networks. b. General Consultant Services Provide general and scientific consultation, across various disciplines in areas such as development of best practices, design of pre-clinical and clinical studies, identification of scientific gaps and medication development.

This guidance, found at: http://ott.od.nih.gov/pdfs/64FR72090.pdf is intended to help contractors ensure that the conditions they impose and accept on the transfer of research tools will facilitate further biomedical research, consistent with the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act and NIH funding policy. Note: For the purposes of this Article, the terms, "research tools", "research materials", and "research resources" are used interchangeably and have the same meaning.

ARTICLE H.22. HOTEL AND MOTEL FIRE SAFETY ACT OF 1990 (P.L. 101-391)

ARTICLE H.23. USE OF FUNDS FOR CONFERENCES, MEETINGS AND FOOD
The Contractor shall not use contract funds to conduct meetings or conferences without prior written Contracting Officer approval. In addition, the use of contract funds to purchase food for meals, light refreshments, or beverages is expressly prohibited.

backgrounds (including racial and ethnic minorities) in the fields of biomedical and behavioral research." In addition, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 require reasonable accommodations to be provided to individuals with disabilities. It is NIH policy that organizers of scientific meetings should make a concerted effort to achieve appropriate representation of women, racial/ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities, and other individuals who have been traditionally underrepresented in science, in all NIH sponsored and/or supported scientific meetings. Therefore, it is the contractor's responsibility to ensure the inclusion of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in all events when recruiting speakers and/or participants for meetings or conferences funded by this contract.

SECTION L - INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION a. INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION [FAR Provision 52.215-1 (January 2006)] (a) Definitions. As used in this provision-"Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. "In writing", "writing", or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. "Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day.

(b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals. (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision. (2) The first page of the proposal must show-(i) The solicitation number; (ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available); (iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item; (iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the offeror's behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and (v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal.

RFP Number : N01DA-12-2229

(i)Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modifications or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award. (4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items. (5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

(7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer. (8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer.

RFP Number : N01DA-12-2229

(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. (1) The proposal submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade secrets; business data (e.g., commercial information, financial information, cost and pricing data); and technical data) which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following statements, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be restricted: "Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), data contained in the portions of this proposal which the offeror has specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes. The offeror acknowledges that HHS may not be able to withhold a record (e.g. data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the HHS's FOI officials must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if HHS has determined that disclosure is required by the Act. If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act. The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act. The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages ( insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other identification)." (2) In addition, the offeror must mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following statement: "Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation." (3) Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive statements or statements differing in substance from those cited above may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with a nonconforming statement(s). (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be - 57 -

RFP Number : N01DA-12-2229

in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection; (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. (End of Provision) b. NOTICE OF SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE 1. General. Offerors are solicited only from small business concerns. The procurement is to be awarded only to one or more such concerns, organizations, or individuals. This action is based on a determination by the Contracting Officer, alone or in conjunction with a representative of the Small Business Administration, that it is in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the Nation's full productive capacity, or in the interest of war or national defense programs, or in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of Government - 58 -

RFP Number : N01DA-12-2229

procurement is placed with small business concerns. Bids or proposals received from others will be considered non-responsive. 2. Definitions. The term "small business concern" means a concern, including its affiliates, which is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and can further qualify under the size standards in this solicitation. In addition to meeting these criteria, a small business concern submitting an offer in his own name shall furnish, in the performing the contract, only end items manufactured or produced by small business concerns in the United States or its outlying areas, provided that this additional requirement does not apply in connection with construction or service contracts. c. NAICS CODE AND SIZE STANDARD Note: The following information is to be used by the offeror in preparing its Representations and Certifications (See Section K of this RFP), specifically in completing the provision entitled, SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REPRESENTATION, FAR Clause 52.219-1. 1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541712. 2. The small business size standard is 500 employees. d. TYPE OF CONTRACT AND NUMBER OF AWARDS 1. The Government anticipates that one award will be made from this solicitation and that the award will be made on/about July 14, 2012. 2. It is anticipated that the award from this solicitation will be an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (task order) type contract with a period of performance of five years. The Government anticipates non-severable cost-reimbursement task orders that shall be fully funded at task order award. The Government does not anticipate awarding any task orders with the initial contract award. The Government however anticipates issuing Task Order Requests for Proposal upon contract award to the successful offeror. The successful offeror shall prepare task order proposals for protocols, with an anticipated task order award date of September 21, 2012. Due to confidentiality concerns, the Government cannot release specific protocol information to offerors before contract award. 3. FAR 16.301-3 limits use of any contract type, other than firm-fixed price, to a contractor whose accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract.

3. Technical Evaluation Proposals will be technically evaluated in accordance with SECTION M - Evaluation Factors for Award of this solicitation. a. Registration of and Results Reporting for Applicable Clinical Trials in ClinicalTrials.gov The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) at: http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi? dbname=110_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ085.110.pdf,Title VIII, expands the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) clinical trials registry and results database known as ClinicalTrials.gov ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) and imposes new requirements that apply to certain applicable clinical trials, including those supported in whole or in part by NIH funds. FDAAA requires: a. The registration of certain "applicable clinical trials" in ClinicalTrials.gov no later than 21 days after the first subject is enrolled; and b. The reporting of summary results information (including adverse events) no later than 1 year after the completion date for registered applicable clinical trials involving drugs that are approved under section 505 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act, biologics, or of devices that are cleared under section 510k of FDCA. The resultant contract will support one or more applicable clinical trial subject to FDAAA. The "responsible party" is the entity responsible for registering and reporting trial results in ClinicalTrials.gov. ˇ Where the Contractor is the IND/IDE holder, the Contractor will be considered the Sponsor, therefore the "Responsible Party." ˇ Where there is no IND/IDE holder or where the Government is the IND/IDE holder, the Government will generally be considered the "Sponsor" and may designate the contractor's Principal Investigator (PI) as the "Responsible Party." ˇ For Multi-Center trials where there is no IND/IDE holder or where the Government is the IND/IDE holder, the "Responsible Party" will be designated at one site (generally - 70 -

RFP Number : N01DA-12-2229

the lead clinical site) and all other sites will be responsible for providing necessary data to the "Responsible Party" for reporting in the database. Additional information is available at http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov 4. Obtaining and Disseminating Biomedical Research Resources As a public sponsor of biomedical research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a dual interest in accelerating scientific discovery and facilitating product development. Intellectual property restrictions can stifle the broad dissemination of new discoveries and limit future avenues of research and product development. At the same time, reasonable restrictions on the dissemination of research tools are sometimes necessary to protect legitimate proprietary interests and to preserve incentives for commercial development. To assist NIH contractors achieve an appropriate balance, the NIH has provided guidance in the form of a two-part document, consisting of Principles setting forth the fundamental concepts and Guidelines that provide specific information to patent and license professionals and sponsored research administrators for implementation. The purpose of these Principles and Guidelines is to assist NIH funding recipients in determining: 1) Reasonable terms and conditions for making NIH-funded research resources available to scientists in other institutions in the public and private sectors (disseminating research tools); and 2) Restrictions to accept as a condition of receiving access to research tools for use in NIH-funded research (acquiring research tools). The intent is to help recipients ensure that the conditions they impose and accept on the transfer of research tools will facilitate further biomedical research, consistent with the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act and NIH funding policy. This policy, entitled, "Sharing Biomedical Research Resources: Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Research Grants and Contracts," (Federal Register Notice, December 23, 1999 [64 FR 72090] will be included in any contract awarded from this solicitation. It can be found at the following website: http://ott.od.nih.gov/pdfs/64FR72090.pdf 5.

instructions contained in Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408, which is incorporated by reference with the same force and effect as though it were inserted here in full text. The instructions in Table 15-2 are incorporated as a mandatory format to be used in this contract, unless the Contracting Officer and the Contractor agree to a different format and change this clause to use Alternate I. (2) As soon as practicable after agreement on price, but before contract award (except for unpriced actions such as letter contracts), the offeror shall submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2. (End of provision) 5. Salary Rate Limitation in Fiscal Year 2012 Offerors are advised that pursuant to P.L. 112-74, no NIH Fiscal Year 2012 (October 1, 2011 September 30, 2012) funds may be used to pay the direct annual salary of an individual through any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation at a rate in excess of the Executive Schedule, Level II* (direct salary is exclusive of Overhead, Fringe Benefits and General and Administrative expenses, also referred to as "indirect cost" or "facilities and administrative (F&A) costs"). Direct salary has the same meaning as the term "institutional base salary." An individual's direct salary (or institutional base salary) is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care or other activities. Direct salary (or institutional base salary) excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. This does not preclude the offeror from absorbing that portion of an employee's annual salary (plus the dollar amount for fringe benefits and associated indirect costs) that exceeds a rate of the Executive Schedule, Level II*. The salary rate limitation set by P.L 112-74 applies only to Fiscal Year 2012 funds, however, salary rate ceilings for subsequent years may be included in future DHHS appropriation acts. Multi-year contracts awarded pursuant to this solicitation may be subject to unilateral modifications by the Government if an individual's annual salary exceeds any salary rate ceiling established in future appropriations acts. The Executive Schedule, Level II* annual salary rate limitation also applies to individuals proposed under subcontracts, however it does not apply to consultants. P.L.112-74 states in pertinent part: "None of the funds appropriated in this Act for the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Substance Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration shall be used to pay the salary of an individual through a grant or other extramural mechanism at a rate in excess of Executive Level II*." LINK TO EXECUTIVE SCHEDULE SALARIES: http://www.opm.gov/oca/11tables/indexSES.asp *Note to Offerors: The current Fiscal Year Executive Level II Salary Rate shall be adhered to in the preparation of your proposal. All costs associated with any resultant contract award shall be in compliance with the current Fiscal Year Executive Level II Salary rates . 6. HUBZone Small Business Concerns Small Business offerors located in underutilized business zones, called "HUBZones," will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-4, NOTICE OF PRICE EVALUATION PREFERENCE FOR HUBZONE SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS, which is incorporated by reference in ARTICLE I.3. of this solicitation. Qualified HUBZone firms are identified in the Small Business Administration website at http://www.sba.gov/hubzone. 7. Total Compensation Plan a. Instructions - 85 -

RFP Number : N01DA-12-2229

1. Total compensation (salary and fringe benefits) of professional employees under service contracts may, in some cases, be lowered by recompetition of these contracts. Lowering of compensation can be detrimental in obtaining the necessary quality of professional services needed for adequate performance of service contracts. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR Part 541, be properly compensated in these contracts. All offerors as a part of their Business Proposal will submit a "Total Compensation Plan" (salaries and fringe benefits) for these professional employees for evaluation purposes. 2. The Government will evaluate the Total Compensation Plan to ensure that this compensation reflects a sound management approach and an understanding of the requirements to be performed. It will include an assessment of the offeror's ability to provide uninterrupted work of high quality. The total compensation proposed will be evaluated in terms of enhancing recruitment and retention of personnel and its realism and consistency with a total plan for compensation (both salaries and fringe benefits). 3. Evaluation for award, therefore, will include an assessment of the Total Compensation Plan submitted by each offeror. b. Evaluation 1. Total Compensation Plan (Professional Employees) In establishing compensation levels for professional employees, the total compensation (both salaries and fringe benefits) proposed shall reflect a clear understanding of the requirements of the work to be accomplished and the suitability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and retain qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must recognize the distinct differences in professional skills and the complexity of varied disciplines as well as job difficulty. Proposals offering total compensation levels less than currently being paid by the predecessor Contractor for the same work will be evaluated, in addition to the above, on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted work of high quality, and availability of required competent professional employees. Offerors are cautioned that instances of lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may be considered a lack of sound management judgment in addition to indicating a lack of understanding of the requirement. 2. Cost (Professional Compensation) Proposals which are unrealistically low or do not reflect a reasonable relationship of compensation to the professional job categories so as to impair the Contractor's ability to recruit and retain competent professional employees, may be viewed as reflecting a failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements. The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. The compensation data required will be used in evaluation of the offeror's understanding of the contract requirements. 3. Other (Labor Relations) An assessment of the potential for adverse effect upon performance and maintenance of the required number of professional employees with requisite skills resulting from an unrealistically low compensation structure will also be made. 4. Federal Acquisition Regulation Clauses incorporated by Reference FAR Clause 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees (FEBRUARY 1993). 8. Other Administrative Data - 86 -

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
1. GENERAL Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors. The factors in order of importance are: technical, cost, and past performance. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, past performance and cost/price are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFP. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFP. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors listed below. 2. COST/PRICE EVALUATION Offeror(s) cost/price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. Cost Realism: The specific elements of each offeror(s) proposed costs are realistic when the proposed cost elements are evaluated and found to: 1) be realistic for the work to be performed; 2) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and 3) be consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror(s) technical proposal. Cost Realism will be evaluated only on the offeror(s) inputs which the Government will use to determine the most probable cost to perform the contract in a manner consistent with the offeror's proposal. Cost realism analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). The result of the cost realism analysis will be considered in the making the best value tradeoff decision.

3. TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS We will apply the following technical evaluation criteria in the evaluation of technical proposals. The evaluation criteria are listed with weights assigned indicating relative importance for evaluation purposes, i.e., a higher weight indicated higher importance. 1. Understanding the Project (20 points) We will evaluate your technical proposal on how well it shows your comprehensive understanding of the project's goals, objectives, and tasks as called for in the Statement of Work (SOW). This includes an evaluation of how thorough is your background discussion of the work contemplated under this project, including applicable laws, data availability, time and other critical issues related to successful project completion. We will evaluate your understanding of the tasks to be performed, their interrelation and complexity. We will evaluate your discussion of anticipated problems and constraints likely to be encountered in performing the work, and your plans, solutions, and approaches to resolve them. 2. Technical Approach (20 points) We will evaluate your technical approach for soundness, practicality, and feasibility to accomplish the tasks and requirements of the Statement of Work. More specifically, we will evaluate for efficacy (a) your discussion of the steps proposed to accomplish each task; (b) your detailed explanations of the methodologies to be employed, - 92 -

RFP Number : N01DA-12-2229

(c) ability to meet critical issues and performance/delivery schedules under the required tasks which will lead to successful completion of the project; and (d) your discussion of anticipated major difficulties and problem areas, and recommended approaches for their solution. 3. Management Plan (15 points) We will evaluate your management plan on its ability to effectively conduct, manage, and coordinate the resources to ensure successful operation of the technical plan and carry out the proposed project. We will evaluate how appropriate, detailed, effective, and feasible is your management plan showing a task loading chart depicting how the project will be administered, time commitments met and distributed among the project functions. More specifically, we will also evaluate your management plan on how clear, appropriate, and effective are its following components. ˇ A person-loading chart that includes staff and any consultants. This chart shall list by task the specific persons involved and their estimated level of effort by either days or hours; ˇ Organizational charts delineating lines of authority and reporting responsibilities for staff and any consultants; coordinating with NIDA and proposed subcontractor(s); and plans for quality control and organizational backup; ˇ A milestone chart addressing tasks and scheduling of deliverables. 4. Personnel (25 points) We will evaluate resumes of key personnel, consultants, and any subcontractors for appropriateness of credentials, training, qualifications, experience, and competence to carry out the project. Basic credentials for proposed personnel will be evaluated for experience and education in clinical trials management, biostatistics, drug abuse research, data management, statistics, and other areas relevant this SOW. We will evaluate letters of commitment from consultants and subcontractors on the degree to which they ensure availability of needed expertise. 5. Facilities, Equipment and Systems (20 points) We will evaluate your proposed physical environment, equipment, software, and facilities for availability, time committed to the project, appropriateness, suitability, and efficiency. In addition, each offeror will be evaluated on the proposed data management systems for the collection of patient clinical trial data. Please include either screen shots of the proposed systems, promotional materials, PowerPoint files showing the system, sample on CD ROM, or other venues which will clearly show the types of information collected and the flow of study data. 4. EVALUATION OF ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY - SECTION 508 The offeror's proposal must demonstrate compliance with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194 for all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used under this contract/order, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports. If your proposal does not include a completed HHS "Section 508 Product Assessment Template" (hereafter referred to as the "Template") which demonstrates that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, or, if the completed "Template" included in your proposal is considered "noncompliant," and the Government includes your proposal in a competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to further discuss, clarify or modify the "Template" during discussions and in your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). If your "Template" is still considered "noncompliant" by the Government after discussions, your proposal may not be considered further for award. 5. INFORMATION SECURITY EVALUATION - 93 -

RFP Number : N01DA-12-2229

You must address information security requirements in your technical proposal. If your technical proposal does not include an Information Security section or does not include adequate information, your proposal may be considered unacceptable and may not be considered further for award. If the Government includes your proposal in a competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to further discuss, clarify or modify the Information Security section of the proposal during discussions and in your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). If the Information Security section of your proposal is still considered unacceptable by the Government after discussions, your proposal may not be considered further for award.

6. PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR Offeror's past performance information will be evaluated subsequent to the technical evaluation. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable. The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.

HHS Guide to Completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template
Purpose: This document provides Vendors with instructions on completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template for the US Department of Health and Human Services

Background: In 2001, the Information Technology Industry Council partnered with the General Services Administration to create a tool that would assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements specified in Section 508. The result of their collaboration was the 508 Evaluation Template ­ a simple, web-based checklist that allows Vendors to document how their product did or did not meet the various Section 508 Requirements.

How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized: This template is also known as the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) The Section 508 Evaluation Template consists of a long series of tables. The Summary Table is used to provide a sense of your product's overall "level-of-conformance" with the Section 508 Standards. Subsequently, the Section 1194.xx Tables contain the detailed subparagraphs that a Section 508 Standard is composed of. It is within these Section 1194.xx Tables that you will define in detail how your product did or did not comply with a specific requirement. Understanding the columns Use the following to understand the use of the three columns in the Section 508 Evaluation Template's tables: Summary Table Column Name Criteria: Supporting Features: Use Describes Subparts B, C, and D of the Section 508 Standards. Enter information summarizing a product's overall "level-of support" for the corresponding Subpart or, when appropriate, to specify Not Applicable. DO NOT ENTER REMARKS OR EXPLANATIONS IN THIS COLUMN. Enter general comments regarding a product's overall "level-of-conformance" with the Applicable Subpart. Section 1194.xx Tables Use Describes a specific guideline that a Subpart is composed of. Enter information summarizing a product's "level-of-support" for a specific guideline.

Typical Scenario for Completing a Section 508 Evaluation Template: To complete the Section 508 Evaluation Template, enlist the services of your company's technical specialist for the product being sought for purchase. HHS requires a measure of technical detail in the responses. Once you have enlisted their assistance: 1) Determine which sections of the Technical Standards (Subpart B-1194.21-26) apply to your product.* Keep in mind that you always must complete the Functional Performance Criteria (Subpart C ­ 1194.31) and Information, Documentation, and Support (Subpart D ­ 1194.41) sections of the Section 508 Evaluation Template. 2) For each section that applies, determine if the product does or does not meet the specific Criteria elements. 3) Using the information found in the How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized section, document in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how your product did or did not meet the applicable standard.
  If the product supports the standard, provide detailed examples of what accessibility features exist and how they are used to support the standard. If the product does not support the standard, remember that Section 508 allows products to meet the Access Board Standards in innovative, non-traditional ways. The product can meet the standard by providing an innovative solution, as long as the feature performs in the same manner as it does for any other user without a disability. If the product does not possess an innovative, non-traditional way of supporting the standard, provide detailed examples of exactly how the product did not meet the standard.



4) Once documented in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how the product did or did not meet, return to the Summary Table and document the product's overall "level-of-conformance" in each of the applicable sections. 5) Post the final Section 508 Evaluation Template on your company's web site or on the GSA Buy Accessible Wizard. 6) It is the Vendor's responsibility to maintain the integrity of the data on the Section 508 Evaluation Template. The information provided on the Section 508 Evaluation Template is considered a self-representation unless expressly affirmed otherwise. Even so, HHS uses this form to complete required Market Research associated with the agency complying with Section 508 and may use the form to eliminate this product compared to other more accessible products that meet the HHS business needs.

* Please Note: Any WEB application being purchased by HHS also requires the Vendor to complete Section 1194.21 of the Section 508 Evaluation Template in addition to Sections 1194.22, 1194.31, and 1194.41.
   HHS reserves the right to reject a PAT and corresponding proposal/offering if the answers do not address the standards. HHS needs the PAT to address the standards in order to evaluate it for conformance. Please answer honestly and be prepared to work with HHS to improve accessibility for your product if it is purchased. Submission of this documentation constitutes a warrant on behalf of the vendor of the conformance of their product. Remediation of a product or service to the specified conformance shall be the responsibility of the vendor.

Invoice/Financing Request Identification: Each payment request shall be identified as either: (a) Interim Invoice/Contract Financing Request: These are interim payment requests submitted during the contract performance period. (b) Completion Invoice: The completion invoice shall be submitted promptly upon completion of the work, but no later than one year from the contract completion date, or within 120 days after settlement of the final indirect cost rates covering the year in which the contract is physically complete (whichever date is later). The Contractor shall submit the completion invoice when all costs have been assigned to the contract and it completes all performance provisions. (c) Final Invoice: A final invoice may be required after the amounts owed have been settled between the Government and the Contractor (e.g., resolution of all suspensions and audit exceptions). Preparation and Itemization of the Invoice/Financing Request: The Contractor shall furnish the information set forth in the instructions below. The instructions are keyed to the entries on the Sample Invoice/Financing Request. All information must be legible or the invoice will be considered improper and returned to the Contractor.

The DUNS number must identify the Contractor's name and address exactly as stated in the contract, and as registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. If the Contractor does not have a valid TIN or DUNS number, provide the Contractor's Vendor Identification Number (VIN), which appears after the Contractor's name on the face page of the award document. [Note: A VIN is assigned to new contracts awarded on or after June 4, 2007, and any existing contract modified to include the VIN number.] When an approved assignment of claims has been executed, the Contractor shall provide the same information for the assignee as is required for the Contractor (i.e., name, address, point of contact, TIN, and DUNS number), with the remittance information clearly identified as such.

ATTACHMENT NO. 11

(c) Invoice/Financing Request Number: Each payment request must be identified by a unique invoice number, which can only be used one time regardless of the number of contracts or orders held by an organization. For example, if a contractor has already submitted invoice number 05 on one of its contracts or orders, it cannot use that same invoice number on any other contract or order. Payment requests with duplicate invoice numbers will be considered improper and will be returned to the contractor. The NIH does not prescribe a particular numbering format but suggests using a job or account number for each contract and order followed by a sequential invoice number (example: 8675309-05). Invoice numbers are limited to 30 characters. There are no restrictions on the use of special characters, such as colons, dashes, forward slashes, or parentheses. If all or part of an invoice is suspended and the contractor chooses to reclaim those costs on a supplemental invoice, the contractor may use the same unique invoice number followed by an alpha character, such as "R" for revised (example: 8675309-05R). (d) Date Invoice/Financing Request Prepared: Insert the date the payment request is prepared. (e) Contract Number and Order Number (if applicable): Insert the contract number and order number (if applicable). (f) Effective Date: Insert the effective date of the contract or if billing under an order, the effective date of the order. (g) Total Estimated Cost of Contract/Order: Insert the total estimated cost of the contract, exclusive of fixed-fee. If billing under an order, insert the total estimated cost of the order, exclusive of fixed-fee. For incrementally funded contracts/orders, enter the amount currently obligated and available for payment. (h) Total Fixed-Fee: Insert the total fixed-fee (where applicable). For incrementally funded contracts/orders, enter the amount currently obligated and available for payment. (i) Two-Way/Three-Way Match: Identify whether payment is to be made using a two-way or three-way match. To determine required payment method, refer to the Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the Contract Schedule. (j) Office of Acquisitions: Insert the name of the Office of Acquisitions, as identified in the Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the Contract Schedule. (k) Central Point of Distribution: Insert the Central Point of Distribution, as identified in the Invoice Submission Instructions in Section G of the Contract Schedule. (l) Billing Period: Insert the beginning and ending dates (month, day, and year) of the period in which costs were incurred and for which reimbursement is claimed. (m) Amount Billed - Current Period: Insert the amount claimed for the current billing period by major cost element, including any adjustments and fixed-fee.

(n) Amount Billed - Cumulative: Insert the cumulative amounts claimed by major cost element, including any adjustments and fixed-fee. If the Contract Schedule contains separately priced line items, identify the contract line item(s) on the payment request and include a separate breakdown (by major cost element) for each line item.

PHS may inform the sexual and/or needle-sharing partner(s) of a subject individual who is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) of their exposure to HIV, under the following circumstances: (1) The information has been obtained in the course of clinical activities at PHS facilities carried out by PHS personnel or contractors; (2) The PHS employee or contractor has made reasonable efforts to counsel and encourage the subject individual to provide the information to the individual's sexual or needle-sharing partner(s); (3) The PHS employee or contractor determines that the subject individual is unlikely to provide the information to the sexual or needle-sharing partner(s) or that the provision of such information cannot reasonably be verified; and (4) The notification of the partner(s) is made, whenever possible, by the subject individual's physician or by a professional counselor and shall follow standard counseling practices. PHS may disclose information to State or local public health departments, to assist in the notification of the subject individual's sexual and/or needle-sharing partner(s), or in the verification that the subject individual has notified such sexual or needle-sharing partner(s). 8. Certain diseases and conditions, including infectious diseases, may be reported to appropriate representatives of State or Federal Government as required by State or Federal law. 9.

Disclosure may be made for the purpose of reporting child, elder or spousal abuse or neglect or any other type of abuse or neglect as required by State or Federal law. POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR STORING, RETRIEVING, ACCESSING, RETAINING, AND DISPOSING OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM: STORAGE: Records may be stored on index cards, file folders, computer tapes and disks (including optical disks), photography media, microfiche, microfilm, and audio and video tapes. For certain studies, factual data with study code numbers are stored on computer tape or disk, while the key to personal identifiers is stored separately, without factual data, in paper/computer files. RETRIEVABILITY: During data collection stages and follow-up, retrieval is by personal identifier (e.g., name, social security number, medical record or study identification number, etc.). During the data analysis stage,

data are normally retrieved by the variables of interest (e.g., diagnosis, age, occupation). SAFEGUARDS: 1. Authorized Users: Access to identifiers and to link files is strictly limited to the authorized personnel whose duties require such access. Procedures for determining authorized access to identified data are established as appropriate for each location. Personnel, including contractor personnel, who may be so authorized include those directly involved in data collection and in the design of research studies, e.g., interviewers and interviewer supervisors; project managers; and statisticians involved in designing sampling plans. Other one-time and special access by other employees is granted on a need-to-know basis as specifically authorized by the system manager. Researchers authorized to conduct research on biologic specimens will typically access the system through the use of encrypted identifiers sufficient to link individuals with records in such a manner that does not compromise confidentiality of the individual. 2. Physical Safeguards: Records are either stored in locked rooms during off-duty hours, locked file cabinets, and/or secured computer facilities. For certain studies, personal identifiers and link files are separated and stored in locked files. Computer data access is limited through the use of key words known only to authorized personnel. 3. Procedural Safeguards: Collection and maintenance of data is consistent with legislation and regulations in the protection of human subjects, informed consent, confidentiality, and confidentiality specific to drug and alcohol abuse patients where these apply. When anonymous data is provided to research scientists for analysis, study numbers which can be matched to personal identifiers will be eliminated, scrambled, or replaced by the agency or contractor with random numbers which cannot be matched. Contractors who maintain records in this system are instructed to make no further disclosure of the records. Privacy Act requirements are specifically included in contracts for survey and research activities related to this system. The OHS project directors, contract officers, and project officers oversee compliance with these requirements. Personnel having access are trained in Privacy Act requirements. Depending upon the sensitivity of the information in the record, additional safeguard measures may be employed. 4. Implementation Guidelines: These practices are in compliance with the standards of Chapter 4513 of the HHS General Administration Manual, "Safeguarding Records Contained in Systems of Records," supplementary Chapter PHS hf: 45-13, and the HHS Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook. RETENTION AND DISPOSAL: Records are retained and disposed of under the authority of the NIH Records Control Schedule contained in NIH Manual Chapter 1743, Appendix 1B "Keeping and Destroying Records" (HHS Records Management Manual, Appendix B-361), item 3000-G-3, which allows records to be kept as long as they are useful in scientific research. Collaborative Perinatal Project records are retained in accordance with item 3000-G-4, which does not allow records to be destroyed. Refer to the NIH Manual Chapter for specific conditions on disposal or retention instructions. SYSTEM MANAGER(S) AND ADDRESS(ES): See Appendix I for a listing of current System Managers. This system is for use by all NIH Institutes and Centers. NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE: To determine if a record exists, write to the appropriate IC Privacy Act Coordinator listed below. In

cases where the requester knows specifically which System Manager to contact, he or she may contact the System Manager directly (See Appendix I). Notification requests should include: individual's name; current address; date of birth; date, place and nature of participation in specific research study; name of individual or organization administering the research study (if known); name or description of the research study (if known); address at the time of participation; and in specific cases, a notarized statement (some highly sensitive systems require two witnesses attesting to the individual's identity). A requester must verify his or her identity by providing either a notarization of the request or by submitting a written certification that the is who he or she claims to be and understands that the knowing and willful request for acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act, subject to a five thousand dollar fine. Individuals will be granted direct access to their medical records unless the System Manager determines that such access is likely to have an adverse effect (i.e., could cause harm) on the individual. In such cases when the System Manager has determined that the nature of the record information requires medical interpretation, the subject of the record shall be requested to designate, in writing, a responsible representative who will be willing to review the record and inform the subject individual of its contents at the representative's discretion. The representative may be a physician, other health professional, or other responsible individual. In this case, the medical/dental record will be sent to the designated representative. Individuals will be informed in writing if the record is sent to the representative. This same procedure will apply in cases where a parent or guardian requests notification of, or access to, a child's or incompetent person's medical record. The parent or guardian must also verify (provide adequate documentation) their relationship to the child or incompetent person as well as his or her own identity to prove their relationship. If the requester does not know which Institute or Center Privacy Act Coordinator to contact for notification purposes, he or she may contact directly the NIH Privacy Act Officer at the following address: NIH Privacy Act Officer, Office of Management Assessment, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 601L, Rockville, MD 20852.
