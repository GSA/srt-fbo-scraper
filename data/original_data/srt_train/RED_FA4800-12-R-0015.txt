2.1. Performance Evaluation. The purpose of the Services Summary is to define performance evaluation. The Performance Objective (column 1) describes what the government will survey. Performance of a service will be evaluated to determine whether or not it meets the Performance Threshold (PT) of the contract. When the PT is exceeded, the COR will document the file with a Corrective Action Report (CAR) or a Performance Assessment Report (PAR) and forward these documents to the Contracting Officer for his determination if further action is necessary. 2.1.1. The government will periodically evaluate the contractor's performance by appointing a representative(s) to monitor performance to ensure services are received. The government representative will evaluate the contractor's performance through inspections of reports and contractor services documentation. The government may inspect each task as completed or increase the number of quality assurance inspections if deemed appropriate because of repeated failures. Likewise, the government may decrease the number of quality assurance inspections if performance dictates. 2.1.2. If any of the services do not conform to contract requirements, the government may require the contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements at no increase in contract amount. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by reperformance, the government may:

10

ATTACHMENT 1: Performance Work Statement 2.1.2.1. Require the contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and 2.1.2.2. Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed. 2.2. Quality Control. The contractor shall develop and maintain a complete quality control program for the performance requirement of this contract to ensure services are performed in accordance with this contract and PWS. The contractor shall develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent, and ensure non-performance and continual repeat of defective service does not occur. A written Quality Control Plan (QCP) shall be submitted to the CO for review and feedback. The plan shall be submitted NLT 30 days after award. The plan shall specifically address the contractor's strategy to provide quality workmanship; continual process improvement; preventing deficiencies and for correcting deficiencies as required. The contractor shall ensure that the following issues are addressed in their QCP: 2.2.1. A description of the methods to be used for identifying and preventing defects in the quality of service performed. 2.2.2. A description of how the records will be kept. Records must document all inspections and corrective or preventive actions taken. 2.3. Quality Assurance. The government shall inspect and evaluate the contractor's performance to ensure services are received IAW requirements set forth in this contract. The COR shall inspect by watching actual task performance, physically checking an attribute of the completed task, checking a management information report, investigating customer complaints, or otherwise inspecting the task or its results to determine whether or not performance meets the standards contained in this PWS. Only one (1) method will be used at a time to evaluate a listed service during an inspection period for payment computation purposes. The COR will record surveillance results. Results of the surveillance then become the official Air Force record of the contractor's performance. When a performance threshold has not been met or contractor performance has not been accomplished, the COR will initiate and provide the contractor with a CAR, PAR or a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR). The contractor shall respond to the report IAW instructions provided and return it to the COR within the suspense date on the form or ten (10) calendar days of receipt. 2.3.1. Failing to meet the performance threshold as outlined in the SS for any of these performance objectives in any one month period shall result in an immediate progress meeting with the CO and other government personnel. 2.3.2. Failing to meet the performance threshold as outlined in the SS of these performance objectives in any combination for any two, or more consecutive or non-consecutive months during a contract period shall result in a warning or letter of concern from the CO. 2.3.3.

2.4. Surveillance Methods. 2.4.1. 100 % Inspection. This method requires the COR to inspect the service each time it occurs. The COR will use the Quality Assurance Surveillance Checklist (QASC) during inspection. The COR's inspection will be on items identified in the Services Summary as 100% Inspection as the Method of Surveillance and the results of the inspection will be documented on the checklist. Any deficiency shall be documented and the contractor shall re-perform service immediately, if appropriate, or within 24 hours at no increase in contract amount. Any unsatisfactory inspection identified but re-performed acceptably shall still be counted as an unsatisfactory inspection for trending purposes. 2.4.1.2 100% Inspection Standard. Receiving two or more unsatisfactory surveillances within a 12 month period may result in unsatisfactory past performance documentation. Continued receipt of unsatisfactory 100% surveillances during the contract period shall constitute a negative trend and the Contracting Officer may take any appropriate action in accordance with the FAR 52.212-4 (a), Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, Inspection/Acceptance. 2.4.2. Periodic Surveillances. This method requires the COR to employ a "spot check" style of evaluation based on the contractor's schedule. Periodic surveillances will be conducted on a scheduled basis (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annually) and may be adjusted, based on quality trends. Any unsatisfactory inspection (defect) result shall be recorded, and the contractor shall re-perform the service after notification by the COR. 2.4.2.1. Periodic Surveillance Standards. Defects identified in the periodic surveillance will be utilized in determining the contractors' acceptable or unacceptable performance as defined in the SS.

This method requires the customer to fill out a locally generated form provided by the COR or CO. The COR will validate the complaint and notify the contractor of valid complaints. The contractor shall acknowledge the complaint within two (2) hours and inform the COR of its recommendation. Any deficiency shall be documented and the contractor shall re-perform service immediately, if appropriate, or within 24 hours at no increase in contract amount. The contractor shall respond to the Customer Complaint in accordance with the instructions provided and return it to the COR within five (5) calendar days of receipt. Any unsatisfactory inspection identified but re-performed acceptably shall still be counted as an unsatisfactory inspection. 2.5. Performance Evaluation/Periodic Progress Meetings. The CO, contract administrator, Functional Commander, COR, other government personnel as appropriate, and the contractor shall periodically meet to discuss the contractor's performance. The contractor may request a
meeting with the CO when deemed necessary. Meetings will be documented in the contract file with written minutes signed by the CO, the contractor and any other signatures as deemed appropriate.

For these item(s), the sum of $ * of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause. (b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled Termination for Convenience of the Government. As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s). (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled Termination for Convenience of the Government. (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly. (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled Disputes. (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause. (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled Default.

This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.
