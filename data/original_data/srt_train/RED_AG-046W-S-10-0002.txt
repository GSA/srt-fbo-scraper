Offerors are required to price all sub-items under each Area. For evaluation purposes only, the amount of each item will be determined by multiplying each priced sub-item by the estimated quantity under that sub-item, then adding all sub-items under that item. This is a Cascading Set Aside: The project will be awarded on an area by area basis. In the event that there are no offers received from HUBZONE firms in any area(s) or all offers received for an area(s) from Hub Zone firms are determined by the Contracting Officer to be outside the range considered fair and reasonable both price and technical factors considered, the Contracting Officer may evaluate offers from non-Hub Zone small business firms for award(s). All award(s) of this contract will be based upon best value to the Government price and other factors considered.

E-3 - BASIS FOR PAYMENT The Government will determine plot quality by inspection of each completed packet. A plot or plot packet is considered complete when all work has been inspected and accepted for payment. An inspection will consist of: 1. Plot Location ­ Referenced in Section B. Plot will be determined to be in correct location. 2. Office Edit - At the discretion of the Government, each plot will undergo an office edit based on procedural errors and omissions. Using the "Inspected Quality Form", Plots whose office edit quality is less than 85.00 percent will be rejected and returned to the Contractor for rework. The Contractor will be given the option of reworking plots whose total pay percent quality is from 85

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Region 6

RFP AG-046W-S-10-0002 Page 11

to 95 percent. The Contractor shall pay the actual Government office edit inspection costs for rejected plot and plot reworked at the Contractor's option. Reference Exhibit A. 3. Field Inspection - The Government will select a minimum of two subplots from a plot in each packet to be field inspected. This field inspection will check the selected plot for accuracy, correctness, and completeness of submitted data. Each measurement, observation or other work as specified by the "Field Instructions" shall be verified and the correct value recorded. Plots will be evaluated by use of the tolerances specified in Exhibit B and instructions contained in the "Field Instructions." 4. Plot Photographs ­ During office edit each subplot photograph will be checked to see that they are clear, sharp, not blurred or taken into the sun. During field inspection each photograph will be checked that it was taken at the specified place, orientation, and height. A. Plot Installation Payment 1. The unit of measure and payment will be the plot as described herein. The plots completed satisfactorily will be processed for payment in accordance with the payment rate provisions herein based on the unit price and will constitute full compensation for furnishing all equipment, labor, supervision, supplies, transportation, and incidentals. A plot or plot packet is considered complete when all work has been inspected and accepted for payment Plot Payment - Any plot(s) within the packet failing to attain an 85.00 percent (see Exhibit A Inspected Quality Form), shall be assessed actual Government costs for determining the quality of that plot. This applies to the first and all succeeding plots within the packet that are less than 85.00 percent. Plot(s) with a quality of 85.00 percent or more will not be assessed any Government costs except as stated elsewhere in this contract. a. At the discretion of the Government: a) Plot(s) selected for field inspection will be office edited to ensure procedural correctness using the "Inspected Quality Form" to record credits and errors, or; b) all plots will be office edited and payment based on the combination of these results and the field inspection described herein. Should the Government elect not to conduct an office edit, payment will be based on the results of the field inspection only. b. A minimum of two subplots from a Plot in each packet will be selected for field inspection to determine the accuracy of measurements. c. The percentage of error (i.e., the difference between 100 percent and the inspection results percentage) found during the field inspection will be added to any percentage of error determined in office edits (errors are only assessed once). Each plot will be accepted for payment, returned for rework or rejected based on the results of the office edit of that plot and the field inspection of the selected plot in the packet. d. "Pay %" will be determined by the overall percent pay quality as calculated in Exhibit A. If the quality percentage is 95% or greater the payment will be at full bid price. Overall percent pay quality of 85% to 94% will be paid at the corresponding percentage. Less than 85% is a failed plot.

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Region 6

RFP AG-046W-S-10-0002 Page 12

Deficiencies ­ When the quality of a field inspected plot does not exceed 84.99 percent (See Exhibit A-Inspected Quality Form), the Contractor will be limited to reworking the remaining plots in the packet. The Contractor will not be allowed to rework a field inspected plot receiving a quality of below 85.00 percent within the meaning of paragraph (e) of FAR 52.246-4, Inspection of Services ­ Fixed Price, contained in Section E. PAYMENT EXAMPLE Assume: $400 per plot bid price. After office edit and field inspection, the plot is determined to be 80 percent (pay percentage). Actual Government inspection costs were determined to be the following: Office Edit Field Inspection Total Gov. Costs = $ 20. = $200. = $220.

Plot price would be determined as follows: $320 (80% of $400) - $220 = $100 Plot's returned for rework shall be completed and returned within 20 calendar days. B. Plot Photograph Certification plots and plots selected for field inspection will be checked for adherence to the technical specification for clear and sharp photos taken at the proper plot and subplot locations. Any plot selected for inspection will also be inspected for plot photography. Any delivered photo that is blurred, overexposed, washed out because of the flash, is too dark, or is generally not clear and sharp will be rejected. The contractor may retake the rejected photo or a deduction of 25% of the bid price per rejected photo per plot will be deducted from the final pay. E-4 - REINSPECTION UPON CONTRACTOR REQUEST If the Government's original inspection results are unacceptable to the Contractor, the Contractor has the option to request, in writing, a reinspection. Requests for reinspection shall be made within five days after receipt of initial inspection results. A complete reinspection of the plot will be made. If the reinspection results differ by 2.00 percent or more from the Government's original inspection results (Pay %), the reinspection results will be used for payment. The Contractor shall pay the cost of Government reinspection when the reinspection results differ by less than 2.00 percent. E-5 - REWORK AND REINSPECTION AFTER REWORK All reworked plots that are returned may be office edited and will be field inspected. The Contractor shall pay the actual costs incurred by the Government for the inspection of any plot that falls below 85 percent quality.

IV.

General shutdown - All operations are prohibited.

The following definitions shall apply to these Industrial Fire Precaution Levels: Cable yarding systems: A yarding system employing cables and winches in a fixed position. Closed season (Fire Precautionary Period): That season of the year when a fire hazard exists as declared by the responsible agency official. Contracting Officer: The person executing the contract, permit or license on behalf of the Government and includes that person's designated representative, acting within the limits of their authority or the duly appointed successor to the individuals. Loading sites/woods site/project area: A place where any product or material (including but not limited to logs, firewood, slash, soil, rock, poles, posts, etc.) is placed in or upon a truck or other vehicle. Low hazard area: Means any area where the responsible agency representative (WDNR, ORF, BIA, BLM) determines the combination of elements reduces the probability of fire starting and/or spreading. Tractor/skidder operations: include a harvesting operation, or portion of a harvesting operation, where tractors, skidders, or other harvesting equipment capable of constructing fireline, are actively yarding forest products and can quickly reach and effectively attack a fire start. Waivers, written in advance, may be used for any and all activities. Activities for which waivers may be issued include, but are not limited to: a. mechanized loading and hauling; b. road maintenance such as sprinkling, graveling, grading and paving; c. cable yarding using gravity systems or suspended lines and blocks, or other yarding systems where extra prevention measures will significantly reduce the risk of fire; d. powers saws at loading sites or in felling and bucking where extra prevention measures will significantly reduce the risk of fire; e. maintenance of equipment (other than metal cutting and welding) or improvements such as structures, fences and powerlines. Such waiver, or substitute precautions will prescribe measures to be taken by the Contractor to reduce the risk of ignition, and/or the spread of fire. The Contracting Officer shall consider site specific weather factors, fuel conditions, and specific operations that result in less risk of fire ignition and/or spread than contemplated when precaution level was predicted. Consideration shall also be given to measures that reduce the precaution levels above. The Contractor shall assure that all conditions of such waivers or substitute precautions are met. The Contractor shall obtain the predicted Industrial Fire Precaution Level daily, prior to the start of work, from the appropriate Ranger District headquarters. If predictions made after 6:00 p.m., local time, are significantly different than the original prediction, the Forest Service will inform the Contractor when changes in restrictions or industrial precautions are made.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. ** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION ** Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only upon such contingencies as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc." (The relevant CBA section) in the collective bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting "arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations. This wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor contract. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Region 6

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

K-4 - FAR 52.209-5 - CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (DEC 2008) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-- (A) Are  are not  presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have  have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (C) Are  are not  presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Region 6

RFP AG-046W-S-10-0002 Page 44

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has  has not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. K-5 - FAR 52.219-28 - POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REPRESENTATION (APR 2009) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority. Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Region 6

engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. (2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. (3) For long-term contracts-- (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter. (c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/. (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees. (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: The Contractor represents that it  is,  is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 115310 assigned to contract number _______________________.

SECTION M--EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M-1 ­ FAR 52.217-5 ­ EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JUL 1990) Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(d) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s). M-2 ­ EVALUATION FACTORS Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the following factors considered of equal value of importance: 1. 2. 3. Technical Capability Past Performance Key Personnel

When combined, these technical evaluation factors are slightly higher than price. However, the Government reserves the right to make price/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government 1. Technical Capability. A firm's Technical Capability will be evaluated based upon their response to how the Statement of Work will be accomplished with an emphasis on the following subfactors: (1) Offeror's ability to complete the project. The government will evaluate the offeror's plan considering the following items: number of crews assigned to the project, priority of areas worked, special equipment used, production plan and logistics. (2) Offeror's ability to deliver data electronically and the offeror's experience with field data recorders (FDR's). The government will evaluate considering the following: Crews experience with FDR's and electronic data delivery, experience with FIA FDR's and software, and a backup plan for data collection in the event of FDR failure. (3) Quality Control Plan. The offeror's Quality Control Plan will be evaluated on how they plan to implement and carry out quality control measures throughout the life of the contract. (4) Plot photographs. The government will evaluate considering the following: A description of proposed photographic equipment and how the contractor plans to use it. The above sub-factors are listed in descending order of importance with: ˇ A plan showing how the Contractor proposes to complete the project weighted as significantly more important than Electronic data delivery. ˇ Quality Control Plan is slightly less important than (2) Electronic data delivery and experience with field data recorders. ˇ Plot photographs ­ is slightly less important than Quality Control Plan.

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Region 6

RFP AG-046W-S-10-0002 Page 53

2. Past Performance. The Government will evaluate the following elements, which are of equal value of importance in relation to each other: a) Quality of the Services - End users satisfaction with work quality, reworks required due to poor work quality, decline in quality to meet production schedule, problems encountered with the project. b) Timeliness of Performance ­ Compliance with delivery schedules, responsiveness to requests for changes in delivery schedule (e.g., added work). c) Customer Satisfaction - Satisfaction of end users with Contractor's completed services. d) Business Relations - Effective management (e.g., business relationships with others, relaying quality concerns, working with others to correct deficiencies and resolve problem areas); working relationship with the Contracting Officer and technical representatives on problem solving and recommending solutions, proposing new or improved processes/procedures, and showing initiative in overcoming obstacles; response to problems with the supervisor and/or operators. Assessment of the Offeror's past performance will be one means of evaluating the creditability of the Offeror's proposal, and relative capability to meet performance requirements. Information utilized will be obtained from the references listed in the proposal and other customers known to the Government, and others who may have useful and relevant information. Evaluation of past performance will often be subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will include a determination of the Offeror's commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgment. However, the basis for conclusions of judgments will be documented. Offerors with past performance data will be evaluated in the same manner as all other evaluation factors; however, those offerors with no relevant past performance data will be treated as an unknown performance risk and neither be evaluated favorably nor unfavorably. Therefore, offerors will receive credit for good past performance, lose credit for poor past performance, and will not receive nor lose credit for no relevant past performance. 3. Key Personnel. The Government will assess the quality and extent of the qualifications of the offeror's proposed key personnel based on a detailed review of the content of the resumes submitted as part of the offer (proposal). Key personnel will be evaluated on the following elements which are of equal value of importance in relation to each other: education and experience relative to forest inventory or Current Vegetation Surveys, field season experience, ability to identify tree species, grasses, shrubs, and forbs, ability to use stereo-paired photos for ground location and demonstrated abilities to efficiently direct crew operations while maintaining quality control. M-3 ­ AWARD DETERMINATION Multiple Awards are anticipated. Award will be made by Area(s). Offerors are required to price all sub-items under each Area. Award will be made to those offerors(s) (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable and (2) whose technical/price relationship is the most advantageous and represents the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make price/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government. The critical factor in making any price/technical trade-off is not the spread between the technical scores, but rather what is the significance of that difference. The significance of the spread in scores will be determined on the basis of what that difference might mean

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Region 6

in terms of performance and what it would cost the Government to take advantage of it. Award may not necessarily be made to that offerors submitting the lowest offer. Also, award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Technical proposals will be evaluated and rated by an individual or a technical board, who do not have access to the price proposals. Proposals will be rated to determine those offerors who are within the competitive range, price and other factors considered. Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms that the offeror could make to the Government. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals or to make award without conducting discussions. Discussions (oral or written) may be conducted as appropriate with all offerors considered to be within the competitive range. For the purpose of this solicitation, discussions shall not be considered to have been initiated when the Government requests additional information supplementing or clarifying a proposal without materially changing it. Discussion shall be considered to be open negotiation with an offeror for the purpose of modifying or materially changing the proposal as submitted. Where discussions are held with one offeror within the competitive range, they will be held with all offerors within the competitive range. Each proposal received will be carefully considered and all information submitted will be kept in strict confidence within legal constraints. This request for proposals does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the preparation of the submission of proposals.

EXHIBIT A Office Edit Criteria: Electronic Files ­ three complete files per plot, .EXP, .DWM, plus file with no extension. Plot Header Card ­ information is legible, concise, and complete. Plot Diagram ­ map is accurate and complete. Plot Edit Sheet ­ information is filled out and in the plot folder. FDM Edit Printout ­ final printout is in the plot folder and errors and warnings are corrected or explained and documented with acceptable level of detail. Condition Class Boundary Printout ­ printout is in the plot folder. Plot Data Printout ­ complete plot data printout for each plot is in plot jacket. Plot Photos (if applicable) ­ hard copies are in the plot folder and/or photo files are turned in with the plot CD. See Exhibit C for photo plot file requirements.

INSPECTED QUALITY FORM The Inspected Quality Form is used to evaluate field plot location, establishment, and data accuracy. The form contains the following categories: Plot Attributes - record plot level attributes about the field crew visit and landowner contact. Condition Class Attributes - record information about the land type that allows grouping and analysis of similar land types. Subplot Attributes - record important information about the physical setting of the plot and the presence and location of contrasting land types on the plot. Boundary References Attributes ­ record condition class boundary mapping information. Downed Woody Debris and Fuel Attributes ­ record transect information on dead, downed pieces of coarse woody debris, fine woody debris count, duff, litter and fuel depths, and microplot fuel loading. Trackable Tree and Snag Selection Attributes ­ record information on individual live and standing dead trees. Tally ­ the tally category is used to evaluate both added and missed tally.

RFP AG-046W-S-10-0002

Seedling Data Attributes ­ record information on microplot seedling counts Vegetation Profile Attributes ­ record information on the abundance, structure, and species composition of understory plant communities. Site Index Attributes - Record information that evaluates the potential productivity of tree growth on a forest site. Ground Cover Attributes ­ record information on the abundance of different ground cover types. Plot Jacket Attributes ­ record and update information contained within the plot jacket including cover card data, jacket label data, plot edit sheets and photo pinpricks and labels. Plot Location Attributes ­ record information on plot center, subplot centers and microplot centers location All 13 categories will be summarized individually and then combined for an average overall plot quality. Field crews must achieve at least 95.0 percent overall pay percent quality in order for the plot to receive full payment. INSTRUCTIONS ON THE USE OF THE INSPECTED QUALITY FORM 1. Inspect and compare every item covered by the Inspection Form and determine if each item is within the tolerance stated in the Field Instruction manual or addendum. Any items found to be out of acceptable tolerance will be errored. On the Contractor's card: a. All items which are extraneous, missing or beyond acceptable tolerance will be highlighted or boxed. These will be considered errors. When various electronic data Notes are required based on Field Instruction manual requirements and not entered, these will also be considered errors. b. Added tally - A tree, indicator species, ground cover type, hardwood clump, down woody piece, or any other tally item which should not have been tallied. No credit will be given for an added tally item. Record each added tree as an error in the "Tally Items" worksheet. All other added items will be recorded as an error in their corresponding worksheets. c. Missed tally - A tree, indicator species, ground cover type, hardwood clump, down woody piece, or any other tally item which should have been tallied. Record each missed tree as an error in the "Tally Items" worksheet. All other missed items will be recorded as an error in their corresponding worksheets. 2. Tally each credit and error entry on the Inspection Form by category from the data received from the Contract Crew. Boxed items will be considered as errors. 3. Summarize the credit and error tally in the appropriate columns.
Page 2 of 12

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Region 6

RFP AG-046W-S-10-0002

4. Summarize total error for each category as follows: Total Error = Error Tally x Error Unit. 5. Summarize total possible credit as follows for each category: Total Possible Credit = (Error Tally + Credit Tally) x Credit Unit. 6. Calculate percent quality for each category as shown below: 1 ­ Total Error Total Possible Credit = Percent Quality

7. Calculate Score % for the plot as shown below: a. Each category has a weighted value (i.e., Plot attributes = 3, Condition Class = 8, DWM = 6, etc.). Sum the weighted values for all categories that have a credit score (i.e., those categories where field data has been collected). b. Divide 100 by the sum of the weighted values to get the Weight % multiplier. Weight % multiplier = 100 / (Sum of weighted values) c. Multiply the Weight % multiplier by the weighted value for each category to get the Weight %: Weight% = (Weight % multiplier) x (Weighted value) d. Multiply the Weight% by the Percent Quality for each category to get the Score %: Score% = (Weight %) x (Percent Quality) 8. Pay % is the Sum of the Score %. 9. Fill in all requested information on Inspection Form as it becomes a permanent part of the Contract Record. Note any comments and observations on the front of the plot inspection form. 10. If contract and manual procedures (and addendum) are not followed during data collection (e.g., DBH nail loose in tree, tree number tag not facing plot center, etc.), information on the data forms will be in error for all items in question.

EXHIBIT C TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR FIA PLOT TRANSECT PHOTOS 1. Overview: A digital photograph shall be taken for each subplot center from the end of one specified transect back towards the subplot center. For each plot, the four digital pictures shall be printed and submitted with the plot folder. Digital images of the four subplot photos, shall be submitted on a CD (Compact Disc) to the COR for inspection before the final payment is made. These digital images shall become a permanent part of the electronic record for each FIA plot. 2. Procedures: a. During the plot installation, the Contractor shall take a picture, either digitally or with a 35mm camera, of each subplot from the end of each 270-degree transect for subplots 1 and 4, and from the end of each 30-degree transect for subplots 2 and 3. b. A 6-foot tall range pole, or equivalent type pole, with 1 foot alternating bands of white and international orange, shall be placed vertical at the subplot center. c. From the end of each transect, as described in paragraph a., 58.9 horizontal feet from the subplot center, with the tape laid out along the transect, a picture, of vertical format, shall be taken in a standing position with the camera pointed back to the subplot center, with the range pole centered in each photograph. The camera shall be held over the end of each transect at about 5 feet high for the picture. d. If the center of the subplot is occluded from view, i.e. the photographer is standing in head high brush or thick reproduction, the picture may be taken from the subplot center and the range pole shall be placed at the end of the transect. If this happens it shall be clearly documented in remarks that the picture was taken from the stake position center. 3. Technical Camera and Photograph Specifications: a. The contractor shall use the type of camera and lens as approved by the CO. The camera shall be at least a 4 Megapixel digital camera or better or a quality 35mm camera. If the camera has a zoom capability it will not be used. The camera shall basically be a point-andshoot type and be set on that setting when taking the photographs. b. Photographs shall have the plot number including 2 digit state code, subplot numbers and installation date placed digitally in the lower left corner of the photograph. The photograph label must be clearly visible against the photo background. If background is dark, use white text or use black text if a light background exists. An example of the format for a subplot 1 photograph is shown below:

Conditional Access to USDA Sensitive but Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement for FIA Staff

I, ______________________________, hereby consent to the terms in this Agreement in consideration of being granted conditional access to certain United States Government documents or material containing sensitive but unclassified information. I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions: By being granted conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with the terms of this agreement. As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is any information which the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of which could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Title 5 U.S.C Section 552a, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy. I am being granted conditional access contingent upon my execution of this Agreement for the sole purpose of collecting and/or utilizing FIA sample site location and land ownership data. This approval will permit me conditional access to certain information and/or to attend meetings in which such information is discussed or otherwise made available to me; including coordinates, maps and ownership information that is sensitive but unclassified. Specific conditions of this Agreement are: a) All individual sample site location and land ownership data are confidential. No plot packets, data forms, reports, computer files, or data sets containing these sample site locations and/or landowner identity may be copied, distributed, or published. Also, summaries or any information that could possibly reveal the location and/or landowner identity of an FIA sample site may not be made public to anyone not covered by a formal agreement with the FIA Program. Ownership and location data will be used only for "statistical, analytical and research purposes" that enhance the FIA Program. b) Dissemination or sharing of data, whether in original form or aggregated, with persons other than those who are directly associated with the FIA Program for which the data were obtained and who have completed the CONDITIONAL ACCESS TO USDA SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT is strictly prohibited. c) Confidential data, including sample site locations, plot landowners, and any derived data from which sample site locations and/or landowner identities could be recovered by a motivated individual will only be stored and used on a computer with security restrictions on file access which include password protection and the absence of a connection to wide area networks or the internet, other than the firewall-protected Forest Service network. d) Any questions regarding access to unpublished data, propriety of reports or analysis shall be referred to the Program Manager, PNW Forest Inventory and Analysis Program, PNW Research Station, USDA Forest Service

RFP AG-046W-S-10-0002

for appropriate response. Landowners requesting location specific information (coordinates, maps, photos, etc.) should contact the FIA Program to make a formal request for materials. This agreement will not allow me access to materials to which the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or USDA Forest Service has predetermined, in its sole discretion, are inappropriate for disclosure pursuant to this Agreement. This may include sensitive but unclassified information provided to USDA by other agencies of the United States Government. I will never divulge any sensitive but unclassified information that is provided to me pursuant to this Agreement to anyone, unless I have been advised in writing by the USDA or USDA Forest Service that the individual is authorized to receive it. Should I desire to make use of any sensitive but unclassified information, I will do so in accordance with Paragraph 6 of this Agreement. I will submit to the USDA or USDA Forest Service for security review prior to the submission for publication, any book, article, column or other written work for the general publication that is based on any knowledge I obtained during my work with private-access of FIA sample site location and landownership data in order for the USDA or USDA Forest Service to ensure that no sensitive but unclassified information is disclosed. I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emolument that have resulted, will result or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of sensitive but unclassified information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement. If I am permitted, at the sole discretion of the USDA or USDA Forest Service, to review any official documents containing sensitive but unclassified information, such review will be conducted at a secure USDA or USDA Forest Service facility or under circumstances that have been approved by the USDA to maintain the security protection of such material. I will not be permitted to and will not make any copies of documents or parts of documents to which conditional access is granted to me. Any notes taken during the course of such access will remain at the USDA or USDA Forest Service, to be placed in secure storage unless it is determined by the USDA or USDA Forest Service officials that the notes contain no sensitive but unclassified information. If I wish to have the notes released to me, USDA or USDA Forest Service officials will review the notes for the purposes of deleting any sensitive but unclassified information to create a redacted copy of the notes. If I do not wish a review of any notes that I make, those notes will remain sealed in secure storage at the USDA or USDA Forest Service. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I understand that the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive but unclassified information could compromise the security of the USDA or USDA Forest Service. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to USDA or USDA Forest Service classified and sensitive but unclassified information in the future. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the United States may institute a civil action for damages or any other appropriate relief. The willful disclosure of information that I have agreed under the terms of this agreement not to divulge may constitute a criminal offense. Unless and until I am provided a written release by the USDA or USDA Forest Service from this Agreement or any portions of it, all conditions and obligations contained in this Agreement apply both during my period of conditional access, which shall terminate at the conclusion of my work with the PNW FIA Program, and at all times thereafter.

RFP AG-046W-S-10-0002

Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. I understand that the Unites States Government may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement, including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government does not waive any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that it may assert in any administrative or court proceeding to protect any sensitive but unclassified information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with or other wise alter the employee obligations, rights or liabilities created by Executive Order 12356; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Protection Act of 1982 (50 U.S.C.421 et seq.)(governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents), and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798 and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. Section 783(b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statues are incorporated into this Agreement and are controlling. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or nondisclosure Agreement that I have executed or may execute with the United States Government. I agree to these conditions concerning the use and distribution of unpublished FIA data collected by the PNW FIA Program. I make this Agreement in good faith, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.

EXHIBIT I Additional Requirements Plot Access Description Record a clear, concise, and legible narrative for the travel route to the RP, in the RP Location and Description section of the Annual Inventory Plot Record Form and on the back of the primary aerial photo. Begin at a permanent starting point. Normally the starting point is at the intersection of two 4 digit, or a 4 digit and a 2 digit, or two 2 digit roads, (Begin route to RP at the junctions of roads 4100 and 4120). In some cases (wilderness access) the starting point may be in reference to a trailhead, or at the end of a local road. Whatever starting point you select, it should be easily identifiable from the map, aerial photo, and on the ground. If the Route to RP narrative becomes an area of concern, contact the COR for additional clarification. The narrative for the Route to RP shall identify the mode of travel (driving, hiking, etc.), route traveled (include road and trail designation number), direction of travel (use cardinal directions), and the distance traveled on each segment. When foot travel becomes the predominant means of accessing to the RP and/or when the travel route is long or complex, install one or more Points of Reference (POR). A POR is a tree or object. Monument each point of reference using 3" by 3" aluminum tags. Inscribe the following information on the tag (reference type, plot number, azimuth, and distance to the next POR or RP). All inscriptions shall be legible and permanent on the aluminum tag for a period of ten years using a #2 pencil. Affix the tag to the base of the POR, facing the avenue of approach, with two aluminum nails. Select live trees as POR over all other objects. Select a tree that is > 5 inches DBH, if possible. When a point of reference occurs on the primary aerial photo pinprick the base of the object, draw a triangle around the pinprick (on the photo back), and label it POR. The reference type is POR, the azimuth is in Reference Type: POR the direction of the next monument (POR or Hex ID: 5363204 RP), and distance is to the next monument Azimuth: 320 (POR or RP). Include this information in the Distance: 640 ` narrative along with tree species (when the POR is a tree), a general description of objects used as a POR, and the diameter of the POR. Example 1: Point of Reference In addition, POR data will be documented in the electronic plot data files as additional RP reference line(s), in order of progress to plot centers. Direct access between points of reference may be possible but it is often a meandering course. Note in the narrative which means of travel it is. If the course does meander, clearly describe such things as drainages, ridge-tops, meadows or other features that are prominent and identifiable on an aerial photo. RP Data Selecting monuments for the RP are paramount to locating and relocating each PSU now and in the future. Locate the RP within 900 feet of the stake position used to define the end of the RP to subplot 1.

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Region 6

RFP AG-046W-S-10-0002

Select live trees 5 inches DBH or greater as an RP. Other objects may serve as references when suitable live trees are not available. Other objects should be long lived and could include, but are not limited to, prominent fence or building corners. When live trees or other photo identifiable objects are not present, a 3/8th inch diameter by 10 inch long piece of steel rebar will be driven into the ground on or near a photo identifiable feature. Leave 2 inches of the rebar above the ground. Record the appropriate information on an aluminum tag, then wire the tag to the exposed part of the rebar. Build a rock monument around the rebar. The monument shall be 18 inches square at the base and 12 inches high. Pinprick the primary aerial photo where subplot one center is and at the base of any object used as an RP. If the object base is not visible, pinprick the photo where the base appears to be (use crown position and shadow as aids). Pinpricks shall not obliterate the item being referenced. Pinprick holes shall not exceed 0.025 of an inch in diameter. On the back of the photo draw a circle around Subplot one center and RP pinpricks. Scribe the following information on two, 3 inch by 3 inch, aluminum tags: Reference type (RP), plot number, azimuth (from RP to subplot 1), and horizontal distance (from RP to subplot 1). All inscriptions shall be legible, using a #2 pencil, and permanent on the aluminum tag for a period of ten years.
Reference Type: Hex ID: Azimuth: Distance: RP 5363204 140 125 `

Example 2: RP tag information

In wilderness areas, use anodized or painted 3 inch by 3 inch aluminum tags that blend with surrounding vegetation. Attach the two scribed aluminum reference tags to the RP, one facing the direction of approach and the other facing the direction of departure. Use two nails and solidly affix the tags to the base of the reference object 12 inches or less above the ground. Also affix two aluminum reference tags 6 ft above the ground, one facing the direction of approach and the other facing the direction of departure. When using a live tree chop away enough bark, without chopping into the cambium layer, to secure the aluminum tag. Insert up to, but not more than, 1.5 inches of the nail into the tree to secure the tag. Record the information about the RP in the RP Data block on the Plot Record Form and on the back of the primary aerial photo. When writing on the back of aerial photos, use black indelible ink. Previously installed plots: On all previously installed plots, if the route to RP, the selected RP, and the RP marking are correct, redo all the monuments to bring them up to the current standards. Plot Narrative Description Record a clear, concise, and legible narrative of present and past events that reflect the current status of the Plot and feature keywords. Following each plot installation, compose a lucid narrative describing the present vegetation condition of that plot area. Include discussions about past disturbances (natural and human) that have affected vegetative development in the plot area. Note the absence of disturbance as well as any past disturbance.

Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Region 6

RFP AG-046W-S-10-0002

Address items with relevant characteristics that describe the past disturbances and present conditions found on the plot. Some items to consider when writing the narrative include slash disposal method, soil type and condition, abundance of rock, cultural resources, specific disease or insect problems, evidence of fire, evidence of domestic or non-domestic animal use, recent thinning, openings and non-stocked areas, wind throw, abundance and type of brush or distinctive ground cover, and slope stability. Subplot Layout Diagram (on back of Plot card) Record the differing conditions that occur across the plot. Delineate abiotic conditions: streams, roads (improved and unimproved), property lines, rocky areas, major land-form changes (cliffs, draws, ridges) and other items that show differences from their neighbors. Delineate biotic conditions: changes in vegetation (type/species/size), changes in ecoclass, and changes in management (harvest activities, thinning, regeneration plantation, etc.) that differentiate themselves from adjacent areas. Label each condition or make a legend for the delineated areas. Subplot position At each installable subplot position drive a cedar stake securely into the ground, leaving 1/3rd of its length above the ground. Secure a yellow round in the top of the stake with an aluminum nail. This is in replacement of the steel pin for subplot centers 2-4 in the "Field Instructions Manual". The nail defines the center of each subplot. Microplot centers will remain as steel pins. Subplot one reference documentation Attach two orange tags to each subplot reference tree. Locate these tags above DBH or at eye level, whichever is higher. Attach one orange tag facing the RP and the other facing 180 degrees from the RP. Position the longest side of each tag parallel to the tree bole and affix with one or two nails. Insert up to, but not more than, 1.5 inches of the nail into the tree. Do not use orange tags in wilderness areas Flagging end of Transect At the end of each subplot transect install a 12" stick or stake in the ground and hang flagging above it. Do not use flagging in wilderness areas. Age On each core that is extracted for trees for the purpose of counting age or growth, mark the 5th and every 10th growth ring with a black mark and place the extracted core next to the tree, directly below where the core was taken.
