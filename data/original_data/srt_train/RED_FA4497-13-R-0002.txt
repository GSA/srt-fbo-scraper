A. To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein.  Offerors are required
   to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications.  Failure to meet a requirement
   may result in an offer being ineligible for award.  Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and
   provide complete accompanying rationale. The response shall consist of three (3) separate parts; Part I –Technical Proposal, Part II – Past

   one electronic CD rom containing each of the three volumes separated in folders.  The offeror shall make no reference to price in either the
   technical or past performance volumes.


C. Alternate proposals shall not be accepted.  The offeror’s proposal and any subsequent negotiated changes thereto shall be binding upon that
   offeror, and the pricing shall be binding for 120 days upon receipt of the proposals.  The Government shall make a final determination
   regarding acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted without requesting any further information.   However, if deemed
   necessary, and at its sole discretion, the Government may request additional information from Offerors clarifying or supplementing, but not
   substantially changing any proposal as submitted for that purpose, the Government may clarify or hold discussions regarding any such proposal
   with the Offeror.

D. Adherence to page limitations established in each area of consideration is imperative, as pages, which exceed the limit will not be reviewed
   by the evaluators.

General Information


A pre-proposal conference and/or site visit will be conducted on 12 August 2013 at 9:30 am/Eastern Standard Time.  Offerors who plan to attend
should contact 2d Lt Allison Chermel, Contract Specialist, at 302-677-5226 no later than 29 July 2013.  The meeting will be held in the
Conference Room  of the trailers on 647 Evreux Street , Dover AFB, Delaware.  Questions should be submitted in writing via email at
allison.chermel.1@us.af.mil or faxed to 302-677-2309 at least five (5) calender days prior to the pre-proposal conference.  Answers will be

INFORMATION REGARDING SUBMISSION OF PROPOSAL:

      1.  DELIVERY THROUGH MAIL SERVICES  (U.S. Post Office, UPS, FedEx, or other commercial service):  Annotate the outside of the envelope to
reflect the proposal number and the proposal closing date and time.  The proposal will be mailed to:

                       436 Contracting Squadron/LGCB
                       Attention:  2d Lt Allison Chermel
                       647 Evreux Street
                       Dover AFB, DE  19902-5639

      2.  HAND-CARRIED OFFERS:  The sealed envelope or package used to submit your proposal must show the time and date specified for receipt of
the proposal, the Solicitation Number, and the name and address of the offeror.  Offerors are cautioned that, when hand-carrying offers to the
436th Contracting Squadron (647 Evreux Street), those individuals not affiliated with this installation must obtain a Visitor’s Pass at the
Visitor Control Center, Bldg 331, located at the Main Gate entrance to Dover AFB.  The visitor must possess and present a current driver’s
license, and current vehicle registration and insurance.  An Offeror intending to hand-carry a proposal should allow sufficient time to obtain
the visitor pass in order that he/she may arrive at the depository prior to the established time for receiving offers.  Offerors are further
cautioned that during a normal security posture some delay can be anticipated for the visitor to process through the Visitor Control Center; as
the security situation on Dover AFB is subject to change without notice, this could create further delays to include a situation where no access
to the installation can be granted.  The burden for delivering the offer remains on the offeror.  Hand-carrying a proposal is recommended to
occur only during the hours between 8:00 a.m. through 4:00 p.m..  The Offeror shall take the following actions: Contact the Visitor Control
Center at (302) 677-3645 to determine if the security posture is conducive to granting the offeror access.  Contact the Contract Administrator
identified on Page 1 of the SF1449, blocks 7a and 7b; determine if the Administrator will be available to sponsor the vendor’s access to the
base.  Late proposals will be processed in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(f) “Late submission, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of
offers.”

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have      , have not      , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)



52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Technical Capability
Price and Price Related Factors
Past Performance


Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

(End of provision)

       ii) Evaluation of proposed prices will include a review of:

           a. Realism – The Government will evaluate the realism of each offeror’s proposed prices.  This will include an evaluation of the

              requirements, and consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror’s technical proposal
              (FAR 15.404-1(d)(1) and FAR 2.101).


           b. Reasonableness – Each proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the proposed prices are reasonable.  Price analysis or other
              techniques may be used to further validate price reasonableness.


           c. Completeness – Each proposal will be evaluated to determine whether all pricing information required by the solicitation has been
              submitted and correlates to the respective sections of the technical proposal.

           d. Balance – In addition, prices will be reviewed for unbalanced offers in accordance with FAR 15.404-1.  Offers that do not meet
              these criteria may be rejected.

           e. Apparent Mathematical Errors - Overriding formulas within the Government provided workbook may result in calculation errors and
              cause the proposal to be considered non-responsive.


3. Performance Confidence Assessment:  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to assess the offeror’s ability to fulfill the
   solicitation requirements. A past performance evaluation will be accomplished for the purpose of assigning a Performance Confidence Assessment
   rating to the offeror’s proposal based on performance ratings of recent and relevant efforts.  The Government will use the following
   procedures in evaluating past performance:

   a. Recency:  In order for past performance to be considered recent, performance must be ongoing or must have been performed within the past
      three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be
      evaluated.

   b. Relevancy:  Relevant performance information will be based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently
      obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant
      experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past
      performance information for the principal offeror. The past performance of teaming partners or subcontractors who are proposed to perform
      less than 30% of the work will not be evaluated.  Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving requirements that are
      similar or greater in scope and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.  Relevancy will be assigned ratings of Relevant
      and Not Relevant.  The Government will give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed relevant to the effort.  The
      following relevancy rating definitions will be used in the assessment of relevancy:

|RELEVANCY ASSESSMENTS                                                                                                           |
|Rating                               |Definition                                                                                |
|RELEVANT                             |Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and        |
|                                     |complexities this solicitation requires.                                                  |
|NOT RELEVANT                         |Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of     |
|                                     |effort and complexities this solicitation requires.                                       |


   c. Performance Confidence Assessments:  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to assess the degree of confidence the Government
      has in the offeror’s ability to supply the services described in the solicitation that meet users’ needs, based on the offeror’s
      demonstrated record of performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of
      Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined below. Offerors with
      no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror’s performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can
      be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating “Unknown Confidence”, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  The
      Government will use the following Performance Confidence Assessment ratings in the assessment of performance confidence:


|PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS                                                                                                |
|Rating                                      |Description                                                                          |
|SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE                      |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high |
|                                            |expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.          |
|SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE                     |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a      |
|                                            |reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required       |
|                                            |effort.                                                                              |
|LIMITED CONFIDENCE                          |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low  |
|                                            |expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.          |
| NO CONFIDENCE                              | Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance     record, the Government has no|
|                                            |expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required       |
|                                            |effort.                                                                              |
|UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE (NEUTRAL)                |No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror’s performance      |
|                                            |record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably|
|                                            |assigned.                                                                            |

   d. In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed
      most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.


4. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to be technically acceptable, have a “Substantial Confidence” performance rating and the
   offeror is determined to be responsible, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this
   point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.

5. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to be technically acceptable or have a “Substantial Confidence” performance assessment, the next
   lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to be technically
   acceptable and have a “Substantial Confidence” performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.  The Source Selection Authority
   shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.

6. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a
   meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past
   performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse past performance is defined as past
   performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from
   sources without a formal rating system.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the
   contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.

7. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to
   conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.

b. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the
   basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of
   options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

c. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for
   acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified
   expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a
   written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared
ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(1) Listed end products.


|Listed End Product                         |Listed Countriesof Origin                                         |

|                                           |                                                                  |
|                                           |                                                                  |

252.237-7023    CONTINUATION OF ESSENTIAL CONTRACTOR SERVICES (OCT 2010)

(2) Mission-essential functions means those organizational activities that must be performed under all circumstances to achieve DoD component
missions or responsibilities, as determined by the appropriate functional commander or civilian equivalent. Failure to perform or sustain these
functions would significantly affect DoD's ability to provide vital services or exercise authority, direction, and control.

(b) The Government has identified all or a portion of the contractor services performed under this contract as essential contractor services in

(d)(1) Notwithstanding any other clause of this contract, the Contractor shall be responsible to perform those services identified as essential
contractor services during crisis situations (as directed by the Contracting Officer), in accordance with its Mission-Essential Contractor
Services Plan.

(2) In the event the Contractor anticipates not being able to perform any of the essential contractor services identified in accordance with
paragraph (b) of this clause during a crisis situation, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer or other designated representative
as expeditiously as possible and use
its best efforts to cooperate with the Government in the Government's efforts to maintain the continuity of operations.

(e) The Government reserves the right in such crisis situations to use Federal employees, military personnel, or contract support from other
contractors, or to enter into new contracts for essential contractor services.

(f) Changes. The Contractor shall segregate and separately identify all costs incurred in continuing performance of essential services in a
crisis situation. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of an increase or decrease in costs within ninety days after continued
performance has been directed by the Contracting Officer, or within any additional period that the Contracting Officer approves in writing, but
not later than the date of final payment under the contract. The Contractor's notice shall include the Contractor's proposal for an equitable
adjustment and any data supporting the increase or decrease in the form prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The parties shall negotiate an
equitable price adjustment to the contract price, delivery schedule, or both as soon as is practicable after receipt of the Contractor's
proposal.

(g) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (g), in subcontracts for the essential services.

ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to
the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency
level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance
decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen, Mr.

interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060
Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2397, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.

shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

APPENDIX 13.5 Traffic Measurement & Analysis Terminology: Average Busy Hour: Identifies the busiest hour periods during the study period. Maximum Usage: Reports the largest measured usage for the study period for a trunk group. Average Maximum Usage: Attempts to "smooth" the high busy hour traffic peaks for the study period. This prevents over and under measurement by averaging the peak busy measurements. Average Maximum Usage/Trunk: Provides the average usage per each member of a trunk group. Percent Occupancy at Average Maximum Usage: Provides information on trunk group usage for the average busy hour usage. For example, 50% occupancy would indicated that at the average peak usages only 50% of the trunk group was being used. Current GOS at Average Maximum Usage: Provides the GOS for the average measure peak service for the trunk group installed. Number of Trunks Required for Recommended GOS: Provides the determined number for trunk group members (circuits) needed to sustain the recommended Grade of Service as determined by the . Figures: Provide a graphical representation for the data collected. Recommended Action: Provides a judgment based only on analyzed findings versus installed/working trunk group members. Measurements: Are based on hourly measurements, preferably from "on-the-hour" to "on-the-hour" during "normal" duty hours. Traffic Usage - CCS (Hundred Call): Is a measurement of busy status of a measured trunk group. 36 CCS is a full period usage, that is, 36 CCS is one hour of usage per circuit. Typically measurements are made every 10 seconds or 100 seconds on the measured circuits. One Erlang is another way of also saying 36 CCS. For example, 1 Erlang is one full hour of measured usage; 1.5 Erlang is equivalent to 1 1/2 hour of usage on a trunk group measured during one hour. In this case, there must be more than one circuit in the trunk group to obtain more than 1 Erlang (36 CCS) of usage in a one hour measured period. Grade of Service (GOS): Is an expression to relate the number of call attempts that were not successfully completed. In terms of trunk traffic studies, GOS is a reflection the number of calls blocked (not completed) due insufficient trunk circuits.
92

Typically, the Poisson (pronounced POY-SON) GOS equation is used. This method assumes that calls are not held when trunks are busy and are cleared from the queue. Other GOS theories allow for calls being held in queue when blocked, however, generally the Poisson method will provide satisfactory determinations. The GOS for an outgoing trunk group with the number of attempted called block due to insufficient trunk circuits can be determined. Generally, the GOS for an incoming trunk group can be determined based on the traffic usage and the number of trunk members, however, the number of calls blocked due to insufficient trunk circuits will not be known. However, a high GOS value or high average traffic usage (33 CCS or higher) will indicate very possible call blockage for the incoming trunk group. GOS in terms of P.01 - For example, is the probability of 1in 100 calls being blocked due to insufficient trunk circuits. Similarly, P.001 is the probability of 1 in 1,000 calls being blocked due to insufficient trunk circuits. Trunk Group: Refers to the entire group of circuits such as Defense Switched Network (DSN), city incoming, or city outgoing. Trunk group members or trunk circuits refer to the individual circuits of a trunk group, such as 36 DSN trunk group member or circuits. 2-Way Trunk Group: is the ability of a trunk group to originate calls in both directions. An incoming trunk group is a trunk group that can only terminate calls into the Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX). An outgoing trunk group is a trunk group, which can only originate calls outgoing from the PABX. With the exception of "radio type" communications, all trunk circuits are duplex operation. This means that whether the trunk is a 4-wire or 2-wire type voice communication can occur in both directions simultaneously. 4-wire circuits imply separate transmit and receive facilities/wire pairs; while 2-wire circuits imply transmit and receive.

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) Does not apply to employees employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity as defined and delineated in 29 CFR 541. (See CFR 4.156) 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A link to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
