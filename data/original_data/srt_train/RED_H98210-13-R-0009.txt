PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS): Performance Work Statement Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) and Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program (YRRP) Advertising, Marketing, and Freedom Award Program 1.0 INTRODUCTION

The Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense Reserve Affairs (OASD-RA) Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) and Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program (YRRP) require contractor services to deliver marketing campaigns to enhance outreach and increase brand recognition of both entities amongst their core customers. More specifically, ESGR requires campaigns focused on enhancing outreach to employers and Reserve Component (RC) Service members. ESGR also requires assistance in planning and execution of the annual Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award program to recognize supportive employers at an event including the Secretary of Defense and/or other distinguished persons. 2.0 BACKGROUND

2.1 ESGR, as directed in Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 1250.01, is the primary DoD office for all matters concerning employer support of the National Guard and Reserve, as well as for employer relations initiatives regarding employee participation in the RCs. As such, ESGR's vision is to foster a culture in which all American employers support and value the employment and military service of members of the National Guard and Reserve. ESGR facilitates and promotes a cooperative culture of employer support for National Guard and Reserve service by developing and advocating mutually beneficial initiatives; recognizing outstanding employer support; increasing awareness of applicable laws and policies; resolving potential conflicts between employers and their service members; and acting as the employers' principal advocate within DoD. Under ESGR's current strategic plan, resources are aligned to enhance brand awareness to all customers and stakeholders, and recognize supportive employers through the execution of the annual Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award program. 2.2 The 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) required the Secretary of Defense to establish a national combat veteran reintegration program to provide National Guard and Reserve Service members and their families with sufficient information, services, referrals and proactive outreach opportunities throughout the deployment cycle. The law mandated the Secretary of Defense to establish the Department of Defense (DoD) YRRP, a national combat Veteran reintegration program and designated the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness as the Executive Agent. YRRP administers and coordinates all reintegration and deployment preparation and sustainment programs for the RC. In order to ensure customers and stakeholders have access to the program, YRRP needs to implement a marketing campaign to

H98210-13-R-0009 Page 32 of 62

(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

ATTACHMENT A:

Evaluation Factors, Criteria, and Rating Methods

1.0.

INTRODUCTION.

1.1. All proposals will be evaluated by the Source Selection Evaluation Board in accordance with the factors and criteria established in this Source Selection Plan (SSP) and in the Request for Proposal (RFP). The criteria provide the basis upon which each evaluation will be based, are established before receipt of the proposals, and are intended to ensure that the evaluation will be a structured process employing equitable measures. Proposals will be evaluated and a contract awarded under the Best Value Continuum approach, to the responsible Offeror whose offer is considered the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. 1.2. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines discussions to be necessary. 1.3 Offerors are cautioned that "parroting" of the PWS with a statement of intent to perform does not reflect understanding of the requirement or capability to perform. 1.4. Pass/Fail Pass/Fail Factor(s) ___ will _X_ will not be used

1.4.1. The purpose of the pass/fail factor(s) is to determine the offeror's ability to fully meet critical eligibility/performance requirement(s). 1.4.2. Offers that meet all of the established criteria will receive a "Pass" rating and will receive further consideration for award. 1.4.3. Offers that do not meet part or all of the established criteria will receive a "Fail" rating and will be ineligible for award and will not be further evaluated. 2.0. EVALUATION FACTORS 2.1. Technical. 2.1.1. The purpose of the technical factor is to assess the offeror's proposed approach, as detailed in its proposal, to satisfy the Government's requirements. There are many aspects which may affect an offeror's ability to meet the solicitation requirements to include technical approach, risk, management approach, personnel qualifications, facilities, small business participation and others. The evaluation of risk is related to the technical assessment.

H98210-13-R-0009 Page 58 of 62

2.1.2. Risk assesses the degree to which the offeror's proposed technical approach for the requirements of the solicitation may cause disruption of schedule, increased costs, degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. Risk will be assessed as one aspect of the technical factor rating. 2.1.3. Any proposal receiving a rating of "Unacceptable" is deemed to have a risk that is so high that award cannot be made against the proposal and the proposal will not be further evaluated. 2.2. Past Performance. 2.2.1. The Past Performance Evaluation results in an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements, based on past performance information. The Performance Confidence Assessment rating is assessed as an overall factor after evaluating aspects of the offeror's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the technical factors and cost or price. 2.2.2. Recency refers to the state or quality of being current. The more recent the contract, the greater the likelihood that the offeror has the capacity to perform in a like manner. Information regarding contract performance that is recent and has a logical connection with the matter under consideration indicates relevancy. 3.0. 3.1. 3.2. EVALUATION FACTOR CRITERIA Pass/Fail Factor ­ see paragraph 1.4. above Criteria for Technical Factor

Element A: Technical Approach and Methodology By addressing each portion of the PWS, proposals shall describe the offeror's understanding of the requirement, assessment of the objectives to be accomplished, methodology for accomplishing the requirement. Element B: Project Management Plan The proposal shall describe the offeror's approach for providing complete program management support that will fully integrate, manage, control, and document all phases of the contract requirements. Proposals shall describe the project management and staffing plans and assess how they will demonstrate the offeror's approach for providing the corporate resources necessary to ensure and maintain service quality levels, staffing levels, training, and risk management. Element C: Quality Control Plan The proposal shall describe the Offeror's approach for instituting and maintaining a capability to ensure the quality and integrity of services/products, including at least: (1) management and task controls to assure work will be completed as required; (2) contingency plans for identifying

H98210-13-R-0009 Page 59 of 62

and correcting problems; (3) and steps that would be taken to assure timely delivery of quality products. 3.3. Criteria for Past Performance Factor Confidence Assessment The Government will conduct a performance confidence assessment based upon the past performance of the offerors and their proposed subcontractors performing major or critical aspects of the requirement as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements. 3.3.1. The Government will consider each offeror's demonstrated, current, relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet the contract's requirement. Contracts completed within the last 3 years are generally considered recent. 3.3.2. In conducting the performance risk evaluation, the Government may use data provided by the offeror and data obtained from other sources it considers current and accurate, including the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). 3.4. Criteria for Price Factor. The Government anticipates that adequate price competition will establish a fair and reasonable price. However, if the Government does not receive adequate price competition, it will evaluate price proposals to ensure price reasonableness of the services being provided to the Government, considering the specific terms and conditions and relevant commercial practices. 4.0. ORDER OF IMPORTANCE. 4.1. Proposals will be evaluated based on best value to the Government using the trade-off approach. For this solicitation factors are listed below in descending order of importance. Price will be evaluated separately and will not be scored. 1. Technical 2. Past Performance 3. Price 4.2. Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. Select the statement below that applies and complete the sentence above: significantly more important than cost or price; approximately equal to cost or price, or significantly less important that cost or price.

5.0. RATING METHODS 5.1. Technical Factor: One of the following ratings will be assigned:

H98210-13-R-0009 Page 60 of 62

TECHNICAL RATINGS
Rating Outstanding Definition The proposal exceeds stated requirements, as reflected through an innovative, comprehensive, outstanding approach. The response is complete in terms of the basic content and level of information the Government seeks for evaluation. There is a high probability of success and minimal risk that this Offeror would fail to meet the quantity, quality, and schedule requirements. Minor weaknesses, if any, need not be corrected to make award. The proposal meets the stated requirements. The response is considered complete in terms of the basic content and level of information the Government seeks for evaluation. There is a reasonable probability of success and little risk that this Offeror would fail to meet the quantity, quality, and schedule requirements. Minor weaknesses, if any, may not need to be corrected to make award. The proposal does not clearly meet the requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. The proposal fails to meet the stated requirements. The response is considered deficient in terms of basic content and level of information the Government seeks for evaluation . The degree of risk is so high that an award cannot be made against the proposal. Any proposal receiving this rating will not be further evaluated.

Acceptable

Marginal

Unacceptable

5.2. Past Performance Factor ­ Relevancy and Confidence Assessment: 5.2.1. One of the following Relevancy ratings will be assigned:

PAST PERFORMANCE RELEVANCY RATINGS
Rating Very Relevant Relevant Somewhat Relevant Not Relevant Definition Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

5.2.2. The combination of relevancy and recency, and performance documented by the information collected by the Government, results in the selection of a performance confidence assessment as outlined below.

H98210-13-R-0009 Page 61 of 62

PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS
Rating Substantial Confidence Satisfactory Confidence Limited Confidence No Confidence Description Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No relevant performance record is available or the off eror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

Unknown Confidence

5.3. Price Factor: Price proposals will not be rated.
