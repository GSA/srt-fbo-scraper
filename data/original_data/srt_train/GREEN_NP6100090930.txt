                                                        CONTRACTOR NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT


AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN    [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR]
AND THE UNITED STATES

1.  Intending to be legally bound, [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] hereby accepts the obligations contained in this agreement in consideration of
[INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] being granted access to sensitive data.  As used in this Agreement, sensitive data is marked or unmarked “sensitive
but unclassified information” (SBU), including oral communications, that meets the standards set by Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
Circular A-130 Appendix 3 and the [INSERT NAME OF CLIENT AGENCY].  I understand any data or systems of records protected from unauthorized

Privacy Act”) is/are sensitive data.  In addition, other categories of information, including but not limited to medical, personnel, financial,
investigatory, visa, law enforcement or other information which, if released, could result in harm or unfair treatment to any individual or
group, or could have a negative impact upon individual privacy, federal programs, or foreign relations is sensitive data.  The term includes
data whose improper use or disclosure could adversely affect the ability of the Agency to accomplish its mission, as well as proprietary data
and information received through privileged sources.  Data of this type which requires protection and limited dissemination must be designated
by any official having signing authority for the material.  I understand and accept that by [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] being granted access to
sensitive data, special confidence and trust has been placed in me by the United States Government.

2.  [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] acknowledge that it has been given access to [INSERT NAME OF CLIENT AGENCY] sensitive data to facilitate the
performance of duties assigned to it for compensation. [INSET NAME OF CONTRACTOR] understands its responsibility to safeguard sensitive data
disclosed to it, and to refrain from disclosure sensitive data to persons not requiring access for performance of official duties.  Before
disclosing sensitive data, [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] must determine the recipient’s “need to know” or “need to access” sensitive data.


3.  [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] has been advised that any breach of this Agreement may result in the termination of [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR]
access to sensitive data, which, if such termination effectively negates [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] ability to perform assigned duties, may
lead to the termination of this contract and/or other relationships with the Departments or Agencies that granted it access.  [INSERT NAME OF
CONTRACTOR] is aware that unauthorized release or mishandling of sensitive data may be grounds for adverse action against [INSERT NAME OF
CONTRACTOR].  In addition, should [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] misuse records requiring protection under the Privacy Act, [INSERT NAME OF
CONTRACTOR] has been advised that unauthorized disclosure of data protected by the Privacy Act may constitute a violation, or violations, of
United States criminal law, and that Federally-affiliated workers (including some contract employees) who violate privacy safeguards may be
subject to disciplinary actions, a fine up to $5,000.00, or both.

4.  [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] understands that all sensitive data to which [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] has access or may obtain access by
signing this Agreement is now and will remain the property of, or under the control of the United States Government.  [INSERT NAME OF
CONTRACTOR] agrees that it must return all sensitive data which has, or may come into its possession or for which it is responsible because of
such access:

a) upon demand by an authorized representative of the United States Government; or
b) upon the conclusion of the contract or other relationship with the Department or Agency that last
granted me access to sensitive data; or
(c) upon the conclusion of the contract or other relationship that requires access to sensitive data.


Unless and until [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] is released in writing by an authorized representative of the United States Government, [INSERT
NAME OF CONTRACTOR] understands that all conditions and obligations imposed upon it by this Agreement apply during the time [INSERT NAME OF
CONTRACTOR] is granted access to sensitive data, and at all times thereafter.


5.  [INSERT NAME OF CONTRACTOR] further agrees:


(a) Signed Agreements. The Contractor further agrees to sign an agreement to this effect with carriers, and other private or public entities
providing proprietary data for performance under this contract. As part of this agreement, the Contractor will inform all parties of its

agreement shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer (CO).
(b) Government Designated Contractors. The Contractor agrees to allow the below listed Government-designated support contractors, possessing
appropriate proprietary agreements and retained by the Government to advise the Government on cost, schedule and technical matters pertaining to

All Government-designated contractors stated herein, or added at a future date shall also enter into nondisclosure agreements with all parties
providing proprietary information to the contractor.

(c) Remedy for Breach. The Contractor agrees that any breach or violation of the certifications or restrictions of this clause shall constitute
a material and substantial breach of the terms, conditions and provisions of the contract and that the Government may, in addition to any other
remedy available, terminate this contract for default in accordance with the provisions of FAR 52.249-6. Nothing in this clause or contract
shall be construed to mean that the Government shall be liable to the owners of proprietary information in any way for the unauthorized release

                                                            COTR LETTER OF APPOINTMENT
Date:

Subj: Appointment as a Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR)
From: (Insert name of contracting officer)
To: (Insert name of prospective COTR)
In accordance with the GSAM 542.202(d), you are hereby appointed as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) under
contract/task order No. (Insert number) with the (Insert the name(s) of the contractor(s)) for (Describe the supplies, services, or construction
being purchased).
As the COTR, your primary duty is to monitor the contractor's performance to ensure that all of the technical requirements under the
contract/task order are met by the delivery date or within the period of performance, and at the price or within the estimated cost stipulated
in the contract/task order.
In the performance of the duties delegated to you in this letter, you are cautioned that you could be held personally liable for actions taken
or directions given by you to the contractor that are beyond the authorities given to you in this letter. The duties or authorities in this
letter are not delegable; therefore, you must advise the Contracting Officer, (Insert name of Contracting Officer) or the Contract
Administrator/Specialist (Insert name of Contract Administrator/Specialist) immediately when you are unable to perform these duties.
Your duties and limitations, as applicable to the contract/task order you will be monitoring, are as follows:
MONITORING PERFORMANCE.
Ensure that the contractor complies with all of the requirements of the statement of work, specifications, or performance work statement, and
when requested by the contractor, provide technical direction to the contractor's technical manager.
This technical assistance must be within the scope of the contract (e.g., interpreting specifications, statement of work, performance work
statement, etc.). When a difference of opinion between you and the contractor occurs, notify the contracting officer or the contract
administrator/specialist immediately for resolution.

Ensure that the personnel being used by the contractor are of the same caliber that was originally proposed by the contractor to the Government.
The experienced personnel contracted for and/or approved by the Government should not be diluted by the use of personnel with less experience.
However, you may not permit changes, substitutions, or additions to personnel. Any decrease in or lack of performance shall be brought to the
attention of the contracting officer or contract administrator/specialist.
You will also be required to complete the "Evaluation of Contractor's Performance Sheet" found at
http://insite.ncr.gsa.gov/orc/fts_contracting.asp  under B.4., Evaluation, Award and Documentation within 30 days after the contractor has met
all terms and conditions of the contract/task order.  Note: This form shall not be used for construction and architect-engineer contracts (see
(FAR) 48 CFR 36.604).
MONITORING COSTS.
Review and evaluate the contractor's progress in relation to the expenditures. When the costs expended by the contractor are not commensurate
with the contractor's progress, bring this to the attention of the contracting officer or contract administrator/specialist for immediate
action.
Review the contractor's invoices/vouchers for reasonableness and applicability to the contract/task order and recommend to the contracting
officer either approval, conditional approval, or disapproval for payment. The review must be completed within five days after receipt of the
invoice or voucher. If you cannot meet the required review time, advise the contracting officer or contract administrator/specialist so that
action can be taken to ensure Government compliance with the Prompt Payment Act, thereby avoiding the payment of interest penalties to the
contractor.
CHANGES TO THE CONTRACT/TASK ORDER.
You cannot authorize the contractor to stop work, and you are not authorized to delete, change, waive, or negotiate any of the technical
requirements or other terms and conditions of the contract/task order. Should a change (monetary or otherwise) to the contract/task order become
necessary, it must be made by a contract/task order modification issued by the contracting officer. When in doubt, contact the contracting
officer or contract administrator/specialist.
Any contract/task order change requested by the contractor must be put in writing by the contractor to the contracting officer for action;
however, you should immediately advise the contracting officer or contract administrator/specialist of the proposed change since it may affect
the contract price, cost, or delivery/performance schedule. When the proposed change is received by the contracting officer, you will be
required to provide the contracting officer with a written analysis and rationale for the change and to evaluate any costs associated with the
change.
You must also recognize and report to the contracting officer any Government required changes to the contract/task order (e.g., items or work no
longer required, changes in the specifications, changes in scope, etc.).


VISITS AND MEETINGS WITH THE CONTRACTOR.
Make arrangements with the contractor for periodic visits to the contractor's plant to: (1) evaluate the contractor's performance; (2) evaluate
changes in the technical performance affecting personnel, the schedule, deliverables, and price or costs; (3) inspect and monitor the use of
Government property, if applicable; and (4) ensure that contractor employees being charged to the contract/task order are actually performing
the work under the contract/task order. A trip report fully documenting all activities during the visit must be written and a copy provided to
the contracting officer within three working days after the visit.
Document the file to record each meeting and telephone conversation with the contractor. A daily log book is recommended which should reflect
the date, time, name, and title of individual(s) involved, the subject matter, and the details of the meeting or conversation.
INSPECTION OF CONTRACT/TASK ORDER ITEMS.
When notified by the contractor or the contracting officer, perform, in accordance with the terms of the contract/task order, inspection,
acceptance or rejection of the supplies, services, or construction. Immediately notify the contracting officer of all rejections and the reason
for the action.
Review progress reports from the contractor and advise the contracting officer of any contractor problems or action required to be taken by the
Government.
STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
FAR 48 CFR Part 3, GSAM  Part 503 , Improper Business Practices and Personal Conflict of Interest, and GSA Supplemental Standards of Ethical
Conduct (5 CFR 6701), provide guidance to avoid improper business practices and personal conflicts of interest and to deal with their apparent
or actual occurrences. Please read these documents very carefully and contact the contracting officer should you require further information or
clarification on this subject matter.
CONTRACT/TASK ORDER FILE CONTENT AND MAINTENANCE.
Establish and maintain an organized contract administration file to record all contractor and Government actions pertaining to the contract/task
order. The COTR's file is of particular importance since the documentation of your interaction with the contractor may be used in the event of
litigation. In addition, an organized file facilitates an easy transition from one COTR to another if reassignment becomes necessary. The
file(s) should be organized as follows:
(1) TAB 1 - The contract instrument (i.e., contract modifications, task orders, delivery orders, and the contractor's responses applicable to
these documents).
(2) TAB 2 - The COTR's delegation letter, and all correspondence between the contractor and the contracting officer, filed in chronological
order.
(3) TAB 3 - A copy of the contractor's invoices/vouchers and any correspondence pertaining to the payments.
(4) TAB 4 - The COTR's trip reports and written memoranda to the file on telephone conversations or other meetings with the contractor.
(5) TAB 5 - A copy of the contractor's progress reports and other contract/task order deliverables, and all correspondence pertaining to these
documents.
(6) TAB 6 â Copies of the inspection and acceptance documentation.
The size of the contract/task order may not warrant a separate folder for each file. If less than five folders are used, the sections must be
tabbed to segregate each file.
TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
COTRs must obtain a FAC-COTR certification before his/her appointment as a COTR.  Training classes to obtain this certification are available at
http://www.faionline.com.  A copy of the required certification must be provided to the CO prior to appointment and kept in the contract/task
order file.  In addition, the COTR must register the completion of courses in the ACMIS at http://admin.acmis.gov.
Officials designated as COTRs must complete 40 hours of continuing learning education every two years.  The refresher training must be
registered in ACMIS at course completion.
EVALUATING PERFORMANCE.
Within 30 days after the contractor has met all terms and conditions of the contract/task order, you must evaluate the contractor's performance
using the evaluation form found at http://insite.ncr.gsa.gov/orc/fts_contracting.asp  under B.4., Evaluation, Award and Documentation.  The
completed documentation must be returned to me.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT
Please acknowledge receipt and acceptance of this appointment by signing the below Acknowledge and Acceptance and returning it to the
contracting officer or contract administrator/specialist. Your appointment as the COTR under the above numbered contract/task order is
terminated upon receipt of a written notice of termination from the appointing contracting officer, the contracting officer's successor, or a
higher level of authority. Please direct any questions you may have on this delegation to the contracting officer or contract
administrator/specialist.

1.0   Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) Objective

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) defines the basis for the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to follow in
evaluating the Contractor’s performance against the Performance Based Statement of Work incorporated into this Contract/Task Order.  This QASP
provides the COTR a methodology to follow to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance, and provides verifiable input for the required
performance evaluations and incentive fee determinations.

This QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the quality, quantity, and timeliness of services or products furnished by the Contractor
versus the steps taken or procedures used to produce the products.

This QASP is based on the premise that the Contractor, not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the
terms of this Task Order.  Good management and the use of adequate quality control procedures will allow the Contractor to perform
satisfactorily.  On the other hand, the Government is responsible for assuring that quality products and services are received from the
Contractor.  In achieving this objective, the COTR will be objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating the Contractor’s performance against
the standards outlined in this document and its appendices.

2.0   Roles and Responsibilities

Contracting Officer (CO).  The CO is the only person authorized to contractually obligate the Government.  While the COTR may evaluate the
Contractor’s performance, only the CO may take formal action against the Contractor for unacceptable performance.  Additionally, only the CO may
change the terms and conditions of the Task Order to include changes in schedule, delivery location, and scope.

GSA FAS Program Manager and Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).  The COTR will be designated in writing by the CO.  The
COTR’s authority is limited to administering the technical aspects of this Contract/Task Order as specified in the COTR appointment letter.



3.0   Performance Standards

Quality Level.  The Government surveillance will determine whether the performance levels set forth in this task order are attained as
identified in the Appendices hereto.

Frequency.  During the performance of this Task Order, the COTR will make periodic observations, i.e.; conduct surveillance, of the Contractor’s
performance.  Every month, the COTR will review and validate the Contractor’s Monthly Status report and Deliverable Reports.

Management Responsiveness.  The COTR will determine whether the Contractor is managing the Task Order effectively, with successful and timely
response to government staff, and any other interested party as identified to each other by the Contractor and the COTR.


4.0   Evaluation Methods

Contract/Task Order Monitoring and Surveillance Reports formats the COTR will use to gather the data from inspections on the Contractor’s
performance are included as appendices.  Each surveillance will be annotated with the date of the inspection, the inspection results, and
comments.  The COTR is responsible for providing copies of this report to the CO and the Contractor.

The COTR will complete Contract/Task Order Monitoring and Surveillance Reports on the quality of the technical performance of the Contractor.
These reports will be used by the COTR for the calculation of the Incentive Fee Amount against the Quality standard.

      Performance Surveillance.  The Contractor will perform self-assessments by gathering customer feedback on actual versus anticipated
performance for such topic areas as quality of products, communications, and reports; as well as timeliness of reports and deliveries.  These
self-assessments will be compared to the COTR’s reports.  The intent is to identify areas of variance between the parties for mutual benefit and
improvement in performance, cooperation, and communication.

Description(s):
REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL:  PLEASE READ THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.    Date: June 23, 2010 Classification Code: 334 – Computer
and Electronic Manufacturing; NAICS 334512 Automatic Environmental Control Manufacturing for Residential, Commercial, and Appliance Use.
Solicitation Number: NP6100090930. Contracting Office Address: General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Service, Assisted
Acquisition Services, 301 7th Street, SW; Room 6109, Washington, DC 20407-0001

A. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the acquisition of contractor services
to develop and refine temperature-limiting control technology that will help to reduce the incidence of unattended cooking fires resulting from
ignition of food in a cooking vessel on a cooktop/range.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is prepared in accordance with the format in
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6 (http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart 12_6.html#wp1088488) in conjunction with the policies
and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award prescribed under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The solicitation
document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37. This announcement constitutes
the only solicitation that will be released. A Proposal from vendors in this business area is being requested and a written solicitation will
not be issued.  All amendments and any other official communications, if any, from the agency regarding this solicitation will be distributed
via https://www.fbo.gov or by a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the Government-wide point of entry.


B. BACKGROUND:  From 2002 to 2004, CPSC staff estimates that ignition of food in a cooking vessel while on a cooktop caused an annual average of
31,200 fires, 160 deaths, 1980 injuries, and $274 million in property loss.  U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) staff has conducted
or sponsored several studies aimed at reducing fires involving ignition of cooking materials on cooktops.  The research demonstrated that food
temperatures and pan-bottom temperatures are reliable indicators of pending ignition that can be exploited to initiate automated temperature-
limiting controls for the surface elements to prevent food ignition.

CPSC staff conducted and sponsored research to develop experimental range control systems for three types of residential cooktops/ranges:
electric coil-type, gas, and electric glass/ceramic.  Each of these experimental control systems showed promise in preventing cooktop fires.
The results of this research were presented to an ANSI/Underwriters Laboratories (UL) 858 Standards Technical Panel (STP) to help establish
performance requirements for any range or cooktop to meet to reduce the incidence of cooking fires.  An STP working group developed a list of
Technical Feasibility Performance Goals (TFPG) to establish a baseline against which candidate systems could be designed and tested.

The resultant task order will be awarded to provide engineering services to further develop residential range fire control systems (for
electric, gas, electric glass/ceramic thermally-conductive and electric glass/ceramic electromagnetic induction cooktops) and evaluate their
performance with respect to the TFPGs.  The range control systems being demonstrated shall be applied to production-model residential ranges.

The contractor shall demonstrate compliance with Section 508 technical standards.  Unless other information is readily available, the Government
intends to rely solely on the information provided by the Contractor in making this determination.

The Government is required to acquire Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) products and services that provide the greatest degree of
compliance with Section 508 while satisfying the functional requirements.  Hence, the Government will evaluate proposals submitted in response
to this solicitation initially to assess the degree of compliance with the Section 508 requirements.  Once the Government determines Section 508
compliance, the Government intends to evaluate responses and make an award on a best value basis in accordance with the remaining technical sub
factors.  In other words, based on the results of the Section 508 compliance determination, Contractors will be selected on the basis of their
Proposal being the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  (See Attachment G)



L.2.9       Type of Order


A firm fixed price type task order will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  The estimated value of the proposed award is between
$280,000 and $300,000.  The government will consider offers that are outside this range.

M.          BASIS FOR AWARD

The government anticipates awarding a firm fixed price order to the contractor whose proposal is the most advantageous to the Government, price
and other factors considered.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described below.  Award may be made to other than the lowest
priced offer.

The non-priced factor is more important than price.

Evaluation Factors:

      1.    Technical Approach
      2.    Price
      3.    Section 508 Compliance

M.1   Price/Cost – Part I Evaluation

The Contractor’s written cost/price proposal (TABS A through D) will be evaluated to determine price/cost reasonableness.  Prices/Costs that are
excessively high or low (without sufficient justification) may be considered unrealistic and unreasonable and may receive no further
consideration.  Any Proposal that is not within the total estimated value cited in Section 17.3 shall include an explanation.  The Government
will reject any proposal that includes any assumptions, conditions or exceptions.

Tab E will be evaluated to assess whether or not an actual or potential Organizational Conflict of Interest exists.  If a disclosed conflict of
interest is found to exist that cannot be mitigated, avoided, or waived in accordance with FAR Part 9.5, that Contractor will be ineligible for
award.

The government will evaluate the proposed number of labor hours and mix of labor in evaluating the total price as well as any discounts
proposed.  The contractor is requested to provide discounts from its schedule pricing.

For award purposes, the government will evaluate offers by adding the total price of all options to the total price for the basic requirement.
Evaluation of options will not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).

Any proposal that contains products/services that are not currently contained on the contractor’s schedule contract or commercial pricelist (as
identified in TAB E), will be ineligible for award.

M.2         Technical Approach Evaluation - Part II


The Government will evaluate the technical approach factor based on the clarity and completeness of the approach and the degree to which the
response meets the requirements of the Solicitation and includes innovative and efficient methodologies.

a.    The quality, accuracy and completeness of contractor’s proposed plan to accomplish the solicitation requirements including the tasks
      outlined in section 2.5, and the completeness and appropriateness of milestones:

b.    The contractor’s ability and plan to timely deliver all reports and other deliverables required by this RFP including the deliverables
      identified in Section 5 by the designated milestones;

d.    The contractor shall map the technical approach/solution to the statement of work and include milestones.  The contractor shall include
      the contractor’s ability and plan to timely deliver all reports and other deliverables required by this RFP, including the deliverables
