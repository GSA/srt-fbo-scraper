All hardware, software, and services provided must be compliant in accordance with 140-01 Information Technology Systems Security and the DHS Sensitive Systems Handbooks 4300A for Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) or 4300B Handbook for Classified Systems. Security Certification/Accreditation: USCG shall provide personnel with the appropriate clearance levels to support the security certification/accreditation processes under this Agreement in accordance with DHS MD 4300A, DHS Sensitive Systems Policy and Handbook. During all SDLC phases of USCG systems, USCG personnel shall develop documentation and provide any required information for all levels of classification in support of the certification / accreditation process. In addition, all security certification / accreditation will be performed using the DHS certification/accreditation process, methodology and tools. DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300 A, Section 4.1.4 requires the "Separation of duties to prevent a single individual from being able to disrupt or corrupt a critical security process." The Policy requires the following: "Components shall divide and separate duties and responsibilities of critical IT system functions among different individuals to minimize the possibility that any one individual would have the necessary authority or system access to be able to engage in fraudulent or criminal activity." Security testing is but one critical systems function that needs to be performed by a provider (either government or contractor) other than the system designer / developer / operator. This requirement is based, in part, on NIST 800-53 Rev 3, Security Control CA-2 Security Assessments enhancement 1 which requires "The organization employs an independent assessor or assessment team to conduct an assessment of the security controls in the information system." Consequently, the vendor that provides C&A services may not perform the security controls testing.

Unless and until I am released in writing by an authorized representative of the Department of Homeland Security (if permissible for the particular category of information), I understand that all conditions and obligations imposed upon me by this Agreement apply during the time that I am granted conditional access, and at all times thereafter. 12. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. 13. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or non-disclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government or any of its departments or agencies. 14. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with, or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights, or liabilities created by Executive Order No. 12958, as amended; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health or safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 USC 421 et seq.) (governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents); and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 USC 783(b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions, and liabilities created by said Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this agreement and are controlling. 15. Signing this Agreement does not bar disclosures to Congress or to an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of Justice that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law. 16. I represent and warrant that I have the authority to enter into this Agreement. 17. I have read this Agreement carefully and my questions, if any, have been answered. I acknowledge that the briefing officer has made available to me any laws, regulations, or directives referenced in this document so that I may read them at this time, if I so choose.
