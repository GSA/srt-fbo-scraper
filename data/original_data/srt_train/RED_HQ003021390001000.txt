 LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL

FAIR OPPORTUNITY

FAR 16.505







1.    Identification of the Requesting Agency/ Contracting Activity:  American Forces Network - Broadcast Center (AFN-BC); Defense Media Activity (DMA) - Riverside CA.



2.  Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved:  Approval to issue a contract on a brand name basis for the purpose of upgrading an existing Avaya G3r PBX to current release Communications Manager 6.0 to support the mission of the Defense Media Activity - Riverside.



3. Description of the Supplies or Services required to meet the Agency’s needs:







 

4.  Identification of the justification rationale and if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service:  FAR 8.405-6(b)(1).  The existing American Forces Network (AFN) communications system is an Avaya G3r that is no longer supported and needs to be upgraded to current Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) specifications. The goal of this requirement is to Engineer, Furnish, Install, Test (EFI&T) and Commission a turnkey Communications Manager 6 upgrade to the current system at the AFN facility in Riverside, CA.  



AFN intends on upgrading the existing system to Communication Manager 6.0 which will utilize existing frames and interconnects. 



The items to be procured will employ Voice over IP technology, which is expected to greatly reduce recurring service provider costs. A complete replacement to the current system is not expected to provide reasonable offset to the benefits of an upgrade, to include system downtime. 



All technical personnel are currently trained on the current system and training to current release would be minimal. Any alternate source would need to provide similar training which represents an additional cost associated with an award to another manufacturer source which is not expected to be recovered or offset through competition. 



5.  A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d):  It is anticipated that placing an order against a schedule contract using the procedures in FAR 8.405 provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  In procurements above the simplified threshold, a separate determination has been made in accordance with DLAD 7.9001 and 7.9002.  This procurement will be synopsized on the NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) website, resulting in a delivery order against a SEWP Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).   A SEWP Prime Contract Holder cannot offer prices higher on their SEWP contract than is offered on their GSA contract. This is exclusive of the surcharge. Since the SEWP fee is 0.45% compared to GSA’s 0.75% fee, SEWP prices must be lower than GSA for that Contract Holder.  All SEWP Delivery Orders are subject to Fair Opportunity. This internal competition provides an incentive for Contract Holders to provide the best possible price in order to be selected for award. 



6.  Other Facts (if any) supporting the Justification:    The existing system has been in operation for nearly twenty years; the high reliability and maintainability factors provide reasonable assurances that the follow-on upgrade will produce similar effectiveness. 



7.  Statement of the Actions (if any) to Remove Barriers that Led to Limited Competition before Any Subsequent Acquisition:  The project manager will continue to stay abreast of technical information as it becomes available both in publications and conferences.  



8.  I certify that the facts which form the basis for this justification are complete and accurate.
