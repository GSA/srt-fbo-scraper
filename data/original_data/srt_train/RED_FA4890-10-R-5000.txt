Questions Received in Response to RFP through 28 July:

You state 32-bit DOD Federal Desktop Core Configuration – Air Force (FDCC-AF) 2.x or 3.x with Office Suite, including a Microsoft Windows 7 Professional license with downgrade rights to Windows Vista Business and Windows XP Professional.  We have two questions—Do you need office suite, like Microsoft Office Suite?  Can you please clarify the operating system normally the downgrade is only to Windows XP Professional.

Response:  No software or operating system is required for this purchase.  The AF owns Enterprise Licenses for all software so this requirement is not required.  



The MIL-STD-461E defines the 461E criteria only.  Do you require the laptops to be 461E ready or to be 461E certified?  If they must be certified, the laptops will carry a 461E sticker on the bottom or each laptop and unique serial number certification authentication letter, correct?

Response:  Required that the laptops be MIL-STD-461E ready. 



Would you accept the 511.4 military grade certification over the industrial grade certification UL913?  In addition, would you allow that military certification to be stenciled on the bottom of the laptop instead of the UL certifications?  If not, why?

Response: The military grade certification in the MIL-STD-810G is part of our requirements. .  Our requirements in the Ruggedized Features section state that the rugged computing devices must have the following requirements.  Intrinsically Safe is one of the rugged requirements that states “Tested IAW IAW MIL-STD-810G method 511.4, para 4.5.2, Procedure I and labeled IAW NFPA 70.” 511.4  (Explosive Environment) is referenced in MIL-STD-810F; however, our requirement is for the MIL-STD-810G and the reference in this standard is 511.5 (Explosive Environment).  Request that the laptops be certified to UL 913, “Standard for Intrinsically Safe Apparatus and Associated Apparatus for Use in Class I, II, III, Division 1, Hazardous (Classified) Locations.”  UL certifications need to be stenciled on the bottom of the laptops so the user in the field can reference these certifications to ensure they can operate the laptops in their respective working environments.  So to answer the question both would be required to be stenciled on the bottom of the laptops. 



We keep seeing tiny_mce_marker—we don’t know what this means.

This is an error that arose when transferring the solicitation document to FBO.gov, that phrase equals “$”.



Please clarify the length of the required warranty for CLIN 0006 and optional CLIN 1006.  Do you want a proposal for 197 total, broken down to 127 and 70?

Length of warranty for the 10-bay battery chargers is sufficient with the standard warranty being offered by the respective manufacturer.    

The intention of CLIN 0006 and 1006, is that the Government will purchase 127 items at time of award, and retain the unilateral right to purchase the remaining 70 later at a firm price agreed upon at time of award.



For CLIN 0007, please clarify you want 420 notebooks.

Response: 420 notebook-type laptops are being requested for CLIN 0007.  This is a rugged laptop in the traditional clamshell-type design.



Please clarify that you want 120 GB solid state drives for CLIN 0001 and 0007.  

Response:  120 GB or higher solid state hard drive is required for both CLIN 0001 and 0007. 

In the past, we have used a hard drive with a hard drive heater blanket.  Since the heater blanket is no longer necessary, because we are installing Solid State Drives, heat will not be an issue. In fact the systems will be more stable because of the solid state drives. Our question is will the storage temperature -40F to 158F suffice the requirement?

Response: Storage temperature ranges are sufficient but must meet OPERATING temperature range of -20F to 140F.



Is this award going to be to one vendor or are you going to award based upon best pricing for the rugged tablet & rugged notebook?

Response: The Government intends to award this requirement to one vendor as an “all-or-nothing” award.  However, the Government reserves the right to make a split-award when in it’s best interest.
