        unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information.
     7. Report to the COR any information that raises an issue as to whether a Contractor employee's eligibility for continued employment,
        access to Department IT systems, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information promotes the efficiency of the

B.    ED 307-17 Conflicts of Interest (2007)

   (A)      The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, has certified that, to the best of their knowledge and belief,  there  are  no
      relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of  interest,  (see  FAR  Subpart  9.5  for
      organizational conflicts of interest), (or apparent conflict of interest)  for  the  organization  or  any  of  its  staff,  and  that  the
      contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict  of  interest  appears  to
      exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of  the  contractor,
      subcontractor, employee or consultant).  Conflicts may arise in the following situations:

     1. Unequal access to information – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or  consultant  has  access  to  non-public  information
        through its performance on a government contract.


     2. Biased ground rules – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or  program,
        on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract,


     3. Impaired objectivity – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or  member  of  their  immediate  family  (spouse,
        parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of  impairing,  impartial  judgment  in  the
        evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or  in  providing  technical  assistance  or
        other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility.
      "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge  of  the
      relevant facts to question a person's objectivity:
         ▪ Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services  that  may
           be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program  administered
           by the Department;
         ▪ Significant connections to teaching methodologies that might  require  or  encourage  the  use  of  specific  products,  property  or
           services; or
         ▪ Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might  require  or  encourage  the  use  of  a  specific
           curriculum, specific products, property or services,
      Contractors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) of  interest
      regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or  potential  conflict  (or  apparent  conflict  of  interest)  would  not  impair  their
      objectivity.
      In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department  will  take  appropriate
      actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict  (or  apparent  conflict  of  interest),  including  but  not  limited  to
      mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such  means  as  ensuring  a  balance  of  views,  disclosure  with  the
      appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict.    In  this  clause,  the
      term “potential conflict” means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest.
   i. The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if “impaired objectivity” or an actual or potential conflict of  interest
      (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure  in  writing  to  the  Contracting
      Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation  with
      the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest).



  ii. Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid
      the appearance of a conflict of interest.  If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered  an
      actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information  to
      the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or
      this contract.  These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, § 1001 and fines  of  up  to
      $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, § 3802.  Further remedies include suspension or debarment from  contracting  with  the  federal
      government.  The Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for  costs  the  Department  incurs  arising  from  activities
      related to conflicts of interest.  An example, such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom  of  Information  Act  requests  as
      related to a conflict of interest.



 iii. In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees  to  eliminate
      the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.


  iv. The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform  substantially
      to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E).



                                                        Conflict of Interest Certification

   The Offeror, _______________________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no present or
   currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or
   task order resulting from Request for Proposal or Contract No. ____________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or
   apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge
   on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive
   advantage.  In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest.  The Offeror further certifies
   that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such
   Conflict of Interest (or apparent conflict of interest).

C.     ED 316-1 Accessibility of Software

   The Department of Education (ED) considers universal accessibility to information a priority for all its  employees  and  external  customers,
   including individuals with disabilities.

   Under Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d,as amended), ED must ensure the accessibility of
   its programs and activities, specifically its obligation to acquire and use accessible electronic and information technology. ED maintains the
   manual, "Requirements for Accessible Software Design," to convey the accessibility needs of the Department to the developers and suppliers  of
   computer applications.

   To comply with the provisions of this clause, the contractor may use the edition of  the  ED  manual  "Requirements  for  Accessible  Software
   Design" in effect at the date of award of this contract or any more recent edition. A copy of the most recent edition of  the  manual  may  be
   found at http://www.ed.gov/fund/contract/apply/clibrary/software.html

   (a) Software delivered to or developed for ED--Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c)  of  this  clause,  all  software  delivered  to  or
      developed for ED, under this contract, for use by ED's employees or external customers must meet all the  requirements  of  the  ED  manual
      "Requirements for Accessible Software Design."  However, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, the contracting officer may waive
      a particular requirement of the ED Manual, provided that ED's use of the software will meet the requirements of Sections 504 and 508 of the
      Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d, as amended).

   (b) Software enhanced or modified for ED--Any enhancements and other modifications, made under this contract  to  software  for  use  by  ED's
      employees or external customers, are subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this clause, regardless of where or how  the  software
      was first developed. Except as otherwise specified elsewhere in the contract schedule, the contractor  is  only  required  to  ensure  that
      enhancements or modifications (not other, preexisting features  or  components)  of  the  software  fully  comply  with  the  accessibility
      requirements of paragraph (a). However, the contractor is encouraged point out any preexisting features or  components  that  do  not  meet
      accessibility requirements and to suggest solutions to ensure the software complies.

   (c) Waiver of requirements--It is recognized that new technologies may provide solutions that are not envisioned in  or  consistent  with  the
      provisions of the manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." Also, compliance with certain requirements of the manual may not be
      feasible for the particular software required. In such extraordinary circumstances, the contracting officer may grant a waiver, in writing,
      to any requirement of the manual or of this clause if it furthers a public interest of ED and will not significantly impair ED's ability to
      ensure accessibility of its programs and activities to all its employees and external customers, including individuals  with  disabilities.
      To request a waiver, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing, listing the specific accessibility  requirements  that
      would not be met and explaining how the accessibility of a particular feature can be achieved  by  alternative  means  or  why  it  is  not
      feasible to make a feature of the software accessible.

   (d) Condition of payment--The contractor agrees that compliance with the provisions of this clause upon delivery of the software to  ED  is  a
      condition of payment under this contract.





D.    ED 317-1 Accommodation/Accessibility for the Disabled (Oct 1999)

   The acquisition and management of Federal Information Processing (FIP) resources shall be conducted in a manner that ensures access to
   computer and telecommunications products and services by all individuals, both federal employees and the public sector, including individuals
   with disabilities. The acquisition, management and utilization of FIP resources are subject to the computer accommodation and information
   accessibility for individuals with disabilities contained in Section 508 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, P.L. 105-220;
   Telecommunications Act of 1996, P.L. 104-104 February 1996, 110 Stat. 56; and in the Telecommunications Accessibility Enhancement Act, P.L.
   100-542 October 1988. FIP resources required under this contract include computer accommodation and information accessibility where the goal
   is to ensure full access, integration and continuity of support to all individuals, including individuals with disabilities. "Computer
   accommodation" means the acquisition or modification of FIP resources to minimize the functional limitations of individuals with disabilities
   so as to promote productivity and provide access to work-related or public information resources. "Individuals with disabilities" are
   individuals with limitations of vision, hearing, speech and/or mobility. The Contractor shall ensure that FIP resources are equally provided
   to all individuals, including individuals with disabilities.
