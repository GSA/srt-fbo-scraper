B.6 STATEMENT OF WORK
I.1 BACKGROUND The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Office of New Reactors (NRO) has implemented Microsoft Enterprise Project Management (EPM) tools. To support the ongoing use and evolution of these tools, and to support other associated regulatory criteria, NRO provides relevant training courses to its staff under the New Reactor Employee Work Training (NEWT) program. The courses offered under this program fulfill three objectives: 1) Enhance various job functions to manage new reactor licensing and inspection schedules and resources. 2) Provide training that prepares students to take relevant certification tests from the following credential providers: o Project Management Institute o Microsoft o International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium 3) Provide continuing education credits (Professional Development Unit [PDU], Continuing Education Unit [CEU], and Continuing Professional Education [CPE]) necessary to maintain existing certifications or to meet other regulatory criteria including: o Office of Personnel Management Guidance 5CFR Part 930, Subpart C o Office of Management and Budget Circular A-11, Part 7, Exhibit 300 Planning, Budgeting, EPM, and Management of Capital Assets Table I.1.1 identifies five NRO staff functions. In addition, the table identifies corresponding course grouping which would enhance each function's ability to manage new reactor licensing inspection schedules and resources. Courses provided under this contract do not provide instruction appropriate for the "All Employee" NRO Staff function. The training needs for the "All Employee" function are satisfied through training at the NRC Professional Development Center (PDC). The courses provided as part of this Statement of Work are not provided at the PDC.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.
