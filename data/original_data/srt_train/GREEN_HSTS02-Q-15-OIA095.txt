STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

1.  INTRODUCTION

The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) is the component of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) responsible for the
development, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a broad range of transportation vetting programs designed to protect the U.S.
transportation system against terrorism.  The Transportation Vetting System (TVS) is a mission-critical, National Security system which operates
24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

2.  SCOPE AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

TVS requires data for all scheduled commercial passenger and cargo flights, worldwide.  The scope of this contract is limited to the flight data
itself.  TVS will ingest and process the flight data; therefore, software applications that provide flight data will not meet the technical
requirements.

The Contractor shall provide the flight data in pipeline-delimited text files.  Files shall be named consistently, and file names shall include
the date of delivery.  All data shall be updated weekly and files shall be posted to a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) site, where they
will be retrieved by TVS.

Flight data shall identify code sharing flights using IATA code standards where applicable.

Help Desk support shall be provided for flight data questions and will be available on a 24x7x365 basis.

The Contractor shall provide a notification procedure for reporting known data errors to TVS.  The Contractor shall provide a notification
procedure for planned and unplanned delays in data delivery.

TVS’ current data subscription expires on March 17, 2015.  The period of performance for this task order is based on the expiration of the
existing subscription, as follows:

4.0   508 COMPLIANCE

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220) requires that when Federal agencies
develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, they must ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities.
Federal employees and members of the public who have disabilities must have equal access to and use of information and data that is comparable
to that enjoyed by non-disabled Federal employees and members of the public.

All EIT deliverables within this work statement shall comply with the applicable technical and functional performance criteria of Section 508
unless exempt. Specifically, the following applicable standards have been identified:

36 CFR 1194.22 – Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications, applies to all Web-based deliverables, including documentation
and reports procured or developed under this work statement. When any Web application uses a dynamic (non-static) interface, embeds custom user
control(s), embeds video or multimedia, uses proprietary or technical approaches such as, but not limited to, Flash or Asynchronous Javascript
and XML (AJAX) then “1194.21 Software” standards also apply to fulfill functional performance criteria.

36 CFR 1194.31 – Functional Performance Criteria, applies to all EIT deliverables regardless of delivery method. All EIT deliverable shall use
technical standards, regardless of technology, to fulfill the functional performance criteria.

36 CFR 1194.41 – Information Documentation and Support, applies to all documents, reports, as well as help and support services. To ensure that
documents and reports fulfill the required “1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria”, they shall comply with the technical standard associated
with Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications at a minimum. In addition, any help or support provided in this work statement
that offer telephone support, such as, but not limited to, a help desk shall have the ability to transmit and receive messages using TTY.

Exceptions for this work statement have been determined by DHS and only the exceptions described herein may be applied. Any request for
additional exceptions shall be sent to the COTR and determination will be made in accordance with DHS MD 4010.2. DHS has identified the
following exceptions that may apply:

36 CFR 1194.2(b) – (COTS/GOTS products), When procuring a product, each agency shall procure products which comply with the provisions in this
part when such products are available in the commercial marketplace or when such products are developed in response to a Government
solicitation. Agencies cannot claim a product as a whole is not commercially available because no product in the marketplace meets all the
standards. If products are commercially available that meets some but not all of the standards, the agency must procure the product that best
meets the standards.

When applying this standard, all procurements of EIT shall have documentation of market research that identify a list of products or services
that first meet the agency business needs, and from that list of products or services, an analysis that the selected product met more of the
accessibility requirements than the non-selected products as required by FAR 39.2. Any selection of a product or service that meets less
accessibility standards due to a significant difficulty or expense shall only be permitted under an undue burden claim and requires approval
from the DHS Office on Accessible Systems and Technology (OAST) in accordance with DHS MD 4010.2.

36 CFR 1194.3(b) – Incidental to Contract, all EIT that is exclusively owned and used by the contractor to fulfill this work statement does not
require compliance with Section 508. This exception does not apply to any EIT deliverable, service or item that will be used by any Federal
employee(s) or member(s) of the public. This exception only applies to those contractors assigned to fulfill the obligations of this work
statement and for the purposes of this requirement, are not considered members of the public.

36 CFR 1194.3(f) – Back Office, applies to any EIT item that will be located in spaces frequented only by service personnel for maintenance,
repair, or occasional monitoring of equipment. This exception does not include remote user interfaces that are accessible outside the enclosed
“space”.

5.0   SECURITY OF SYSTEMS HANDLING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND PRIVACY INCIDENT REPONSE

(a)  Definitions.

“Breach” (may be used interchangeably with “Privacy Incident’) as used in this  clause  means  the  loss  of  control,  compromise,  unauthorized
disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or any similar situation where persons other than  authorized  users,  and  for  other
than authorized purpose, have access or potential access to Personally Identifiable Information, in usable form whether physical or electronic.

“Personally Identifiable Information (PII)” as used in this clause means any information that  permits  the  identity  of  an  individual  to  be
directly or indirectly inferred, including any other information that is linked  or  linkable  to  that  individual  regardless  of  whether  the
individual is a citizen of the United States, legal permanent resident, or a visitor to the United States.

Examples of PII include:  name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number, Social Security Number (SSN), email address, zip code,  account
numbers, certificate/license numbers, vehicle  identifiers  including  license  plates,  uniform  resource  locators  (URLs),  Internet  protocol
addresses, biometric identifiers (e.g., fingerprints), photographic facial
images, or any other unique identifying number or characteristic, and any information where it is reasonably  foreseeable  that  the  information
will be linked with other information to identify the individual.

“Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (Sensitive PII)” as used in this clause is a subset of Personally Identifiable Information,  which
if lost, compromised or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment,  inconvenience,  or  unfairness  to  an
individual.  , Complete social security numbers (SSN), alien registration numbers (A-number) and  biometric  identifiers  (such  as  fingerprint,
voiceprint, or iris scan) are considered Sensitive PII even if they are not  coupled  with  additional  PII.   Additional  examples  include  any
groupings of information that contains an individual’s name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements:

                    1) Driver’s license number, passport number, or truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits)
                    2) Date of birth (month, day, and year)
                    3) Citizenship or immigration status
                    4) Financial information such as account numbers or Electronic Funds Transfer Information
                    5) Medical Information
                    6) System authentication information such as mother’s maiden name, account passwords or personal identification numbers (PIN)

Other Personally Identifiable information may be “sensitive” depending on its context, such as a list of employees with  less  than  satisfactory
performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number.  In contrast, a business card or public telephone directory of agency  employees
contains Personally Identifiable Information but it is not sensitive.

(b)  Systems Access.  Work to be performed under this contract requires the  handling  of  Sensitive  PII.   The  contractor  shall  provide  the
Government access to, and information regarding systems the contractor operates on behalf of the Government under this contract,  when  requested
by the Government, as part of its responsibility to ensure compliance  with  security  requirements,  and  shall  otherwise  cooperate  with  the
Government in assuring compliance with such requirements.  Government access shall include independent validation  testing  of  controls,  system
penetration testing by the Government, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) data reviews, and access by agency Inspectors  General
for its reviews.

(c)  Systems Security.  In performing its duties related to management, operation, and/or access of systems containing Sensitive PII  under  this
contract, the contractor, its employees and subcontractors shall comply with  applicable security requirements described in DHS Sensitive  System
Publication 4300A or any replacement publication and rules of conduct as described in TSA MD 3700.4

In addition, use of contractor-owned laptops or other media storage devices to process or store PII is prohibited under this contract  until  the
contractor provides, and the
contracting officer in coordination with CISO approves, written certification by the contractor that the following requirements are met:

           (1)  Laptops employ encryption using a NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 or successor approved product;


           (2)  The contractor has developed and implemented a process to ensure that security and other applications software are kept current;


           (3)  Mobile computing devices utilize anti-viral software and a host-based firewall mechanism;


           (4)  When no longer needed, all removable media and laptop hard drives shall be processed (i.e., sanitized, degaussed, or  destroyed)
           in accordance with DHS security requirements.


           (5)  The contractor shall maintain an accurate inventory of devices used in the performance of this contract;


           (6) Contractor employee annual training and rules of conduct/behavior shall  be  developed,  conducted/issued,  and  acknowledged  by
           employees in writing. Training and rules of conduct shall address at minimum:
                 (i)   Authorized and official use;
                 (ii)       Prohibition against use of personally-owned equipment to
                       process, access, or store Sensitive PII;
                  iii) Prohibition against access by unauthorized users and
                       unauthorized use by authorized users; and
                   iv) Protection of Sensitive PII;


           (7)  All Sensitive PII obtained under this contract shall  be  removed  from  contractor-owned  information  technology  assets  upon
           termination or expiration of contractor work.  Removal must be accomplished in  accordance  with  DHS  Sensitive  System  Publication
           4300A, which the contracting officer will provide upon request.  Certification of data removal will be performed by the  contractor’s
           Project Manager and written notification confirming certification will be delivered to the contracting  officer  within  15  days  of
           termination/expiration of contractor work.


(d)  Data Security. Contractor shall limit access to the data covered by this clause to  those  employees  and  subcontractors  who  require  the
information in order to perform their official duties under  this  contract.  The  contractor,  contractor  employees,  and  subcontractors  must
physically secure Sensitive PII when not in use and/or  under  the  control  of  an  authorized  individual,  and  when  in  transit  to  prevent
unauthorized access or loss.  When Sensitive PII is no longer needed or required to be retained under  applicable  Government  records  retention
policies, it must be destroyed through means that will make the Sensitive PII irretrievable.

The contractor shall only use Sensitive PII obtained under this contract for purposes of  the  contract,  and  shall  not  collect  or  use  such
information for any other purpose without the prior written approval of the contracting officer.  At expiration or termination of this  contract,
the contractor shall turn over all Sensitive PII obtained under the contract that is in its possession to the Government.

(e)  Breach Response.  The contractor agrees that in the event of any actual or suspected breach of  PII  (i.e.,  loss  of  control,  compromise,
unauthorized disclosure, access for  an  unauthorized  purpose,  or  other  unauthorized  access,  whether  physical  or  electronic),  it  shall
immediately, and in no event later than one hour of discovery, report the breach to the contracting officer, the Contracting Officer’s  Technical
Representative (COTR), and the TSA Director of Privacy Policy & Compliance (TSAprivacy@dhs.gov).  The contractor is  responsible  for  positively
verifying that notification is received and acknowledged by at least one of the foregoing  Government parties.

(f)  Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement.  The contractor has in place procedures and the capability to promptly  notify
any individual whose Sensitive PII was, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached, as determined appropriate.  The method and  content  of
any notification by the contractor shall be coordinated with, and subject to the prior approval  of  the  Government,  based  upon  a  risk-based
analysis conducted by the Government in accordance with DHS Privacy incident Handling  Guidance.   Notification  shall  not  proceed  unless  the
Government has determined that: (1) notification is appropriate; and (2) would not impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize  national
security.

Subject to Government analysis of the breach and the terms of its instructions to the contractor regarding any resulting breach  notification,  a
method of notification may include letters to affected individuals sent by first class mail, electronic  means,  or  general  public  notice,  as
approved by the Government.  At minimum, a notification should include:  (1) a brief description of how the breach occurred;  (2)  a  description
of the types of personal information involved in the breach; (3) a statement as to whether the information was encrypted or  protected  by  other
means; (4) steps an individual may take to protect themselves; (5) what the agency is doing, if anything, to investigate the breach, to  mitigate
losses, and to protect against any further breaches; and (6) point of contact information identifying who affected individuals  may  contact  for
further information.

In the event that a PII breach occurs as a result of the violation of a term of this contract by the contractor or its employees, the  contractor
shall, as directed by the contracting officer and at no cost to the Government, take timely action to correct or mitigate  the  violation,  which
may include providing notification and/or other identity protection services to affected individuals for a period not to exceed  12  months  from
discovery of the breach.  Should the Government elect to provide and/or procure notification or identity protection services  in  response  to  a
breach, the contractor will be responsible for reimbursing the Government for those expenses.

(g)  Pass-Through of Security Requirements to Subcontractors.   The contractor agrees to incorporate the substance of this clause, its terms  and
requirements, in all subcontracts under  this  contract,  and  to  require  written  subcontractor  acknowledgement  of  same.   Violation  by  a
subcontractor of any provision set forth in this clause will be attributed to the contractor.
