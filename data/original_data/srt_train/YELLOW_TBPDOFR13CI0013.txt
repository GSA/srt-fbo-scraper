TERMS, CONDITIONS AND CLAUSES

SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE All electronic and information technology (EIT) procured through this solicitation must meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194, unless an agency exception to this requirement exists. (36 CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. In accordance with the above, in addition to the requirements specified in the Specifications, the Contractor shall ensure that all EIT that they provide either: (1) meets the technical provisions of the Section 508 Access Board Standards applicable to a given procurement (see below); or (2) uses designs or technologies as alternatives to those prescribed in the specified technical provisions, provided they result in substantially equivalent or greater access to and use of a product for people with disabilities. The following standards have been determined to be applicable to this solicitation:   1194.21 Software applications and operating systems. 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications. 1194.23 Telecommunications products. 1194.24 Video and multimedia products. 1194.25 Self-contained, closed products. 1194.26 Desktop and portable computers. 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria 1194.41 Information, Documentation and Support

The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology device, but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and devices so that it can be made accessible if so required by the agency in the future." The Contractor shall submit a completed Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) for each EIT product listed in their proposal. By completing the VPAT the Contractor represents that the products offered in response to this solicitation comply with the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards at 36 CFR 1194, unless stated otherwise within the VPAT form. The Contractor shall indicate, for each line item, whether each product is compliant or noncompliant with the accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194.

SOFTWARE FEDERAL DESKTOP CORE CONFIGURATION (FDCC) All software which is designed to run on Windows Vista or XP desktops must function without modification to the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) security configurations developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Software and hardware products that are designed to operate in environments other than the FDCC desktop must have a standard configuration guide published on the NIST website, or the vendor must supply a recommended configuration guide for all configurable security settings.

USE OF INFORMATION Contractor grants the Office of Financial Research ("OFR"), and the Financial Stability Oversight Council ("Council"), a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, display, disclose and distribute the data and information provided under this Contract (collectively "Information") for the purposes, and in the manner, described below: A. The Information may be used for governmental purposes which includes: (i) referencing or incorporating excerpts of Information, either in unmodified, aggregate or any other form intended to meet governmental purposes, into works that either OFR or the Council creates, including but not limited to reports, analyses, summary findings, memoranda, research papers, speeches, testimony, visual representations such as charts, graphs, tables, and models, publications (including any Council or OFR document distributed to the public), presentations, policy documents, and New Work (defined below in Section (B)) whether in print, electronic, digital or other form (collectively, ("Work Product")); and (ii) sharing Work Product, including Information

Page | 3 TBPDOFR13CI0013

incorporated into Work Product, and any Information necessary to explain such Work Product, with Council member agencies and staff assigned to work on Council matters; and with other government agencies who have a need to know; and (iii) reproducing and distributing Work Product to the public in print, electronic, digital or other form. OFR and the Council shall give Contractor, or Contractor's third party supplier where appropriate, credit as the source of any Information contained in Work Product. B. When this Contract expires or terminates, OFR and the Council can continue to: (i) use the Information to create, use and publish new works, including works that contain, incorporate, or reference excerpts of Information ("New Work"); and (ii) use and publish Work Product generated prior to the expiration or termination of this Contract. C. Upon the expiration or termination of this Contract, OFR and the Council are not required to collect, recover, return, or destroy any Work Product, or to purge, scrub or otherwise redact any Information contained in any Work Product. Contractor further agrees that: (i) Work Product which contains, incorporates, or references excerpts of the Information, shall not be considered derivative works or derivative products over which Contractor has ownership or control; and (ii) creation and use of Work Product is a non-commercial use that does not compete against Contractor's business activities or the business activities of Contractor's third-party suppliers. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Use of Information section and any other provisions contained in documents related to this Contract, (including click-through and shrink-wrap agreements, attachments and exhibits), the terms of this Use of Information section shall prevail. This Use of Information section shall survive the expiration or termination of the Contract.

(9) The specification. (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) * Are, * are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

Rating Guidelines
Quality of Product or Service 0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding Unsatisfactory Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards containing similar requirements Poor Fair Good Excellent Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements. Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements. There are very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements. There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate additional costs to the Government. The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".
