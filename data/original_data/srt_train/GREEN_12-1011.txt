Background Information 0.1 MONAHRQ overview and motivation. This section provides a brief overview of the MONAHRQ project and the factors that motivated it. It serves as background information to help offerors understand the tasks required in the acquisition. It does not assign specific tasks for offerors to address in their proposals. MONAHRQ ญ My Own Network, Powered by AHRQ ญ is an innovative software tool from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). One of 12 agencies in the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). AHRQ's mission is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of healthcare for all Americans. To improve healthcare, it is clear that we must be able to measure healthcare quality and costs. We must also be able to effectively communicate this information to consumers, providers, payers, and other stakeholders. But local organizations can find quality reporting efforts expensive and time consuming. Must each organization reinvent quality reporting itself? In 2010, AHRQ addressed these needs by creating MONAHRQ. MONAHRQ is a web builder tool that allows any organization to quickly and easily create a fully functional local healthcare reporting website, which the organization hosts itself. Currently, a MONAHRQ-generated website can provide information on hospital quality; hospital utilization, rates, and costs; potentially avoidable hospital stays; and county utilization, rates and costs of hospital use. MONAHRQ uses local hospital discharge data or other precalculated quality measure results. Currently, MONAHRQ can load and report selected measure results from CMS Hospital Compare (www.hospitalcompare.hhs.gov). MONAHRQ is a desktop tool, not an AHRQ service. The local organization must download MONAHRQ, supply its own administrative data, generate the website onto its own computers, and host the website itself. As of fall 2011, MONAHRQ is used by several states for public quality reporting. Numerous other organizations appear to be in the process of evaluating, testing, and using MONAHRQ, either for public reporting or as an internal analysis tool. MONAHRQ was recognized as one of

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 7 of 108

six finalists in Fall 2010/Winter 2011 round of the HHSinnovates.competition, designed to recognize and reward innovation in HHS. 0.2 Goals and directions for MONAHRQ. This section provides a brief overview of AHRQ's general goals and direction for MONAHRQ. AHRQ sees substantial potential for MONAHRQ as a tool to facilitate local public reporting and healthcare data analysis. Gcurrently include the following: ท Encourage local public reporting. The intent of MONAHRQ is to help make public reporting easier, faster, more meaningful and useful to consumers, and less resource intensive. MONAHRQ can provide users with an easy to use, reliable, high-quality tool supported by outstanding technical assistance. AHRQ's goal is to make the MONAHRQ tool easier to use even as it develops into a more complex and capable product. Disseminate standard measures sets to the local level. MONAHRQ should help organizations create reports using endorsed, industry standard measures. Moving forward, we plan to expand MONAHRQ's capabilities to report more measure sets and more types of measure sets. MONAHRQ should be capable of using measure results that are calculated either centrally, such 82as Hospital Compare measures, or locally, such as the AHRQ Quality Indicators. In addition to standard measures, MONAHRQ users may also wish to report their own locally-defined measures. Disseminate best reporting practices and guidelines to the local level. MONAHRQ should help local organizations create effective, well designed reports that are valid and actionable. The MONAHRQ-generated website will need to continually evolve to incorporate best practices and guidelines in reporting. MONAHRQ may also play a role in advancing knowledge about effective reporting practices. Help target local reports to local needs. Different organizations have different, evolving reporting needs. MONAHRQ must support a wide variety of customization options that can help tailor reports for specific needs, while still incorporating recommended reporting guidelines. Harmonize local reporting practices. Currently, local reports differ widely, making them more difficult to interpret and compare. MONAHRQ can help local organizations collectively generate public reports that are consistent, comparable, and up to date on reporting practices and guidelines. Help promote and assess the use of local reporting websites.

Over the next few years, AHRQ hopes to achieve significant advances in the MONAHRQ project. The base period of the contract will begin with an intensive review and analysis of MONAHRQ technical requirements, followed by a substantial redesign of the MONAHRQ software in order to support project goals over the next several years. New capabilities will continue to be added to the existing MONAHRQ software, but in a relatively limited way. After the release of the redesigned MONAHRQ software, the project will embark on a series of annual releases that AHRQ expects will greatly expand MONAHRQ's capabilities. MONAHRQ will be able to report new data and measures; to communicate information more effectively through new data analysis and reporting features; and to provide a wider range of customization options that help host users tailor website information for specific audiences, domains, or communications channels. During this time, AHRQ also hopes to increase

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 8 of 108

MONAHRQ adoption; to improve the project's visibility; and to strengthen the project's capacity to engage, coordinate, and collaborate with stakeholders.

0.3 MONAHRQ history and context. This section provides a brief overview of other AHRQ projects and initiatives related to MONAHRQ. It also provides brief descriptions of released MONAHRQ versions. 0.3.1 Related AHRQ projects. MONAHRQ was first conceived in 2008. The project was born of two popular and widely used AHRQ products, the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) and the AHRQ Quality Indicators (QIs). It has also benefitted from previous AHRQ work in measurement and local and regional public reporting. More recently, the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides additional support for new AHRQ activities in quality measurement and reporting. The timeline of these new activities places them during the base period for this acquisition. 0.3.1.1 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project AHRQ's long-running Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) collects voluntarily submitted all-payer hospital administrative data from most states in the US. HCUP is the largest all-payer database in the US, collecting data from 45 states. HCUP data includes 95% of all hospital discharges in the US. The HCUP project uses this data to create three national datasets, and also to create enriched state datasets which are used by researchers and others around the country. Parts of the MONAHRQ-generated reporting website are modeled after HCUPnet, HCUP's online aggregate data query system. MONAHRQ relies on HCUP data for the nationwide and regional benchmarks that are packaged into the MONAHRQ software. Such benchmarks are important, as they provide points of comparison for local organizations that are engaged in measurement and reporting but lack access to data other than their own. While HCUP data is used for research and aggregate data analysis, the data may not, however, be used or released by AHRQ or any HCUP data user for any public reporting that identifies individual providers. (AHRQs authorizing legislation, Public Law 106-129, Sec. 924 (c), places limitations on the use of information obtained by AHRQ.) AHRQ;s data partners at the state level set rules for provider-level release of the state data, and at this point there are hospital-level public reports using this data coupled with AHRQ measures (see below) in half of the states. 0.3.1.2 The AHRQ Quality Indicators The AHRQ Quality Indicators, introduced in 1994 as the HCUP Quality Indicators, are a set of standardized healthcare quality measures that can be calculated solely using hospital administrative data. AHRQ pioneered the concept of measuring quality of care using

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 9 of 108

administrative data. The AHRQ QIs are currently used for public reporting in 26 US states. Approximately half of the AHRQ QIs are endorsed by the National Quality Forum (NQF). The AHRQ QIs are unusual in that the measure developer, AHRQ, supplies not just technical measure specifications but software tools with which to calculate them directly from data. AHRQ makes the AHRQ QI software tools available in two versions, a SAS version and a Windows version. The initial versions (1.0 through 3.0) of the MONAHRQ software embed the AHRQ QI software for Windows. They use the AHRQ QI software for two purposes: 1. To load, format, and error check the input hospital administrative input data. 2. To calculate the AHRQ QIs, including risk adjustment. According to current plans, however, future MONAHRQ versions beginning with version 4.0 will no longer embed the AHRQ QI software. Instead, MONAHRQ host users will need to provide their own precalculated QI measure results ญ which they will presumably calculate using a separate copy of the AHRQ QI software ญ and MONAHRQ will load and report them. 0.3.1.3 Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys. Launched by AHRQ in 1995, the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys are a comprehensive, evolving family of surveys that ask consumers and patients to evaluate the interpersonal aspects of health care. These surveys cover topics important to consumers, such as providers' communication skills and the accessibility of services. The CAHPS program is funded and administered by AHRQ, working closely with the public-private CAHPS Consortium. The CAHPS family currently includes the Health Plan Survey, the Clinician and Group Survey, the Experience of Care and Health Outcomes survey, and the Hospital survey (HCAHPS). MONAHRQ versions 2.0 and subsequent versions are able to import and report HCAHPS measures. 0.3.1.4 Building the Science of Public Reporting initiative In FY 2011, AHRQ is embarking on a three-year initiative funded through the ACA to build the science of public reporting. The initiative includes an array of grants and contracts designed to build the evidence base for public reporting. It will also supporta coordinating center designed to diseeminate the research and translate it into practice, as wellas a user group consisting of representatives from HHS and other public reporting stakeholders. AHRQ intends that the MONAHRQ project will coordinate with this initiative and review and incorporate its results.

0.3.1.5 Community Quality Collaboratives

Community quality collaboratives, also known as Chartered Value Exchanges (CVEs), are community-based multi-stakeholder organizations ญ including health care providers, purchasers (employers, employer coalitions, Medicaid and others), health plans, and consumer advocacy organizations ญ that are working together to transform health care at the local level. Specific CVE goals include measuring and publishing healthcare quality information for consumers; Request for Proposal AHRQ-12-10011 MONAHRQ Page 10 of 108

measuring and publishing healthcare price information for consumers; promoting quality and efficiency of care, and adopting interoperable health information technology. The AHRQ Learning Network for CVEs, a national program founded in 2007, offers these organizations tools and resources to assist their efforts.
0.3.2 MONAHRQ version history. 0.3.2.1 MONAHRQ version 1.0 The first version of MONAHRQ was released in June 2010. It uses hospital administrative data to calculate the AHRQ Quality Indicators (both hospital-level measures and county-level measures), hospital-level utilization and cost statistics, and county-level utilization and cost statistics. For the county-level AHRQ QIs, MONAHRQ also calculates estimated cost savings associated with reducing hospital admission rates. The local host user must supply the input data. AHRQ does not supply it. MONAHRQ uses the input data to quickly and easily generate a reporting website for the host user to host. MONAHRQ does include precalculated nationwide and regional benchmarks used in the reporting website for comparison purposes. These benchmarks are important for local reporting organizations that may lack access to broader regional or national data. Currently, benchmarks are calculated each year by AHRQ and CMS. MONAHRQ currently supports a modest amount of website customizability such as selecting which types of information to report, selecting which specific measures to display, setting cell size reporting thresholds, inserting logos, and adjusting the style and color scheme to match existing websites. For examples of how organizations have customized MONAHRQ, links to publicly available MONAHRQ sites can be found at monahrq.ahrq.gov/msites.shtml. 0.3.2.2 MONAHRQ version 1.1 MONAHRQ version 1.1 was released in November 2010. It is similar to MONAHRQ 1.0 but includes a more recent version of the AHRQ Quality Indicators software for Windows, version 4.2, which contains updates for coding year 2010. 0.3.2.3 MONAHRQ version 2.0 MONAHRQ version 2.0 was released in July 2011. It adds the ability to report CMS Hospital Compare inpatient measure results: all inpatient process measures except for the children's asthma measures, mortality and readmissions measures, and patient experience measures. The MONAHRQ software does not calculate the Hospital Compare measures directly from raw data. Instead, host users must load into MONAHRQ a file of precalculated Hospital Compare measure results. The MONAHRQ project makes cleaned, formatted versions of these files available for download on the MONAHRQ website. Version 2.0 also includes an updated user interface for the MONAHRQ-generated reporting website. The MONAHRQ 2.0-generated website embeds links to a set of quality improvement guides, My Quality Improvement (MyQI), that were created under previous MONAHRQ efforts. The guides

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 11 of 108

explain and organize links to recent, high-quality external resources about quality improvement. Each guide focuses on a specific quality improvement area that can be reported in MONAHRQ. The guides are intended to help make the information reported in MONAHRQ more actionable. Some guides are for patients and some are for professionals. The guides are hosted on the main MONAHRQ website. 0.3.2.4 MONAHRQ version 3.0 MONAHRQ version 3.0 was released in October 2011. It adds the ability to report CMS Hospital Compare outpatient measure results: outpatient imaging measures and outpatient surgical process measures. It also adds a new Nursing Sensitive health topic. Version 3.0 increases the host user's ability to save and reload website customization information to make regenerating a website quicker and easier. 0.3.2.5 MONAHRQ version 4.0 MONAHRQ version 4.0 is anticipated to be released in fall 2012. According to AHRQ's current plans, it will no longer embed the AHRQ QI software. Instead, host users will calculate the AHRQ QI measures separately and load the results into MONAHRQ. Version 4.0 is also expected to include additional new features to be determined, such as summary pages showing all quality measures for specific hospitals or counties. 0.4 Technical overview of MONAHRQ. The following provides a brief technical overview of MONAHRQ in its current form. It serves as background information to help offerors understand the tasks required in the acquisition. It does not assign specific tasks for offerors to address in their proposals. 0.4.0 Definitions

In this solicitation, the following MONAHRQ-related terms will be used as defined below. MONAHRQ host user An organization that downloads the MONAHRQ software and uses it to generate a reporting website. The organization then presumably hosts the new website. MONAHRQ end user A visitor to a website generated using MONAHRQ. MONAHRQ host application The desktop MONAHRQ software that a MONAHRQ host user downloads and uses to generate a website. MONAHRQ-generated website A website that a MONAHRQ host user generates using MONAHRQ. MONAHRQ website The main MONAHRQ website that provides software downloads and information about MONAHRQ. It is located at monahrq.ahrq.com. 0.4.1 How to use the MONAHRQ software

MONAHRQ is a desktop software tool, not a service. Each step of the MONAHRQ process is controlled by the local MONAHRQ host user. AHRQ does not collect host users' data, calculate their measure results, or host their websites. This approach is advantageous given that

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 12 of 108

MONAHRQ loads and generates sensitive data and information. More details about each of the steps described below can be found in the MONAHRQ Host User Guide, available on the MONAHRQ website, monahrq.ahrq.gov. Please see Section 0.6, Resources, for information on finding the MONAHRQ Host User Guide. Step 1. Download and install. To use MONAHRQ, a host user first downloads and installs the MONAHRQ software and any needed supporting software onto a local computer. MONAHRQ versions 1.0 to 3.0 require three pieces of supporting software: 1. The Microsoft .NET framework. 2. SQL Server or SQL Server Express. 3. The AHRQ Quality Indicators Risk Adjustment software. According to AHRQ's current plans, however, MONAHRQ version 4.0 and subsequent versions will no longer require the AHRQ Quality Indicators Risk Adjustment software. Step 2. Load data. Host users then load data into MONAHRQ. The most recent version of MONAHRQ, version 3.0, accepts either or both of the following types of data: ท Hospital discharge data. The MONAHRQ host user must supply any local discharge data. It is not provided by AHRQ. If the host user loads hospital administrative discharge data, the MONAHRQ software helps map the data into the format used by MONAHRQ. This format resembles the one used by the HCUP project. ท CMS Hospital Compare measure results. The Hospital Compare website makes publicly available data files containing measures results. If host users load Hospital Compare data, however, they must use the cleaned, formatted Hospital Compare data files that the MONAHRQ project posts on the MONAHRQ website, monahrq.ahrq.gov. The MONAHRQ project does this because CMS uses varying formats in the Hospital Compare data files. If a host user loads both local data and Hospital Compare data, MONAHRQ helps crosswalk hospitals between the two data sets. MONAHRQ error checks the input data and writes it into a SQL Server or SQL Server Express database. MONAHRQ then calculates the AHRQ Quality Indicators from the host user's hospital discharge data, assuming it was loaded, using an embedded copy of the AHRQ Quality Indicators software for Windows. Again, AHRQ currently plans that MONAHRQ 4.0 will not embed the AHRQ Quality Indicator software and will not directly calculate the AHRQ QIs; the host user will need to calculate them in advance. In term of MONAHRQ's runtime performance, this data load step is the most time consuming. The time required for data load processing depends on the size of the input data set, but processing can take 24 hours or more. The majority of this time is spent calculating and risk adjusting the AHRQ QIs. Step 3. Select options.

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 13 of 108

Next, the host user walks through a number of screens that allow them to enter information about hospitals, regions, and website options that MONAHRQ will use when building the generated website. Examples of website options include: selecting which types of information to report, selecting which specific quality measures to display, setting cell size reporting thresholds, inserting the host organization's logo, and adjusting the style and color scheme to match an existing website. Step 4. Generate the website. MONAHRQ finishes its data processing. It then automatically generates a full set of website files onto the host users' own computer. For a more detailed description of the MONAHRQgenerated website, see section 0.2.2, The MONARHQ-Generated Website. Step 5. Host the website. Host users can now inspect their website to verify correctness, transfer the website files to a web server, and host the site as they wish. The host user can choose to use its MONAHRQgenerated website internally, as a password-protected site for members, or as a public website for the community. 0.4.2 The MONAHRQ-generated website

AHRQ intends that the MONAHRQ-generated website be interactive, understandable, and easy to use. The site attempts to incorporate best practices in public reporting. It provides navigation and search, help information, and reports in the form of bar charts, maps, tables of icons, and tables of numbers. As of version 2.0, the MONAHRQ-generated website can report four types of information, each in its own website path: 1. Hospital quality measures. ท Hospital-level AHRQ Quality Indicators: inhospital mortality, patient safety, utilization of procedures, and volume of procedures. ท Hospital Compare inpatient measures: 30-day mortality, readmissions, process of care, and patient experience (based on Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and System, or HCAHPS). 2. Potentially avoidable hospital stays. ท The area-level AHRQ Quality Indicators, reported at the county level, for preventable hospitalizations (ambulatory care sensitive conditions) and patient safety measures. 3. Hospital-level utilization statistics. ท Numbers of discharges by condition and procedure, mean charges and costs, and length of stay by individual hospital. 4. Area-level utilization statistics, reported at the county level. ท Rates of discharges by condition and procedure.by county More details about the methods underlying the information reported in the MONAHRQgenerated website can be found at the main MONAHRQ website at monahrq.ahrq.gov. Methods information is contained in the MONAHRQ Host User Guide, available on the software

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 14 of 108

download page, and under the Resources menu option in the live MONAHRQ demo site, available at monahrq.ahrq.gov/demo/index.html. The MONAHRQ-generated website is designed to be secure and simple to host. The website supports interactive queries, but it does not connect to a backend database. Web pages use only client-side technologies that do not require a specific hosting environment, such as HTML, Cascading Style Sheets, and JavaScript. The files in a MONAHRQ-generated website number in the tens of thousands with a footprint of up to several gigabytes, depending on the number of measures, hospitals, and counties being reported. More details about the technical structure of the MONAHRQ-generated website can be found in the MONAHRQ Host User Guide. For a better understanding of the current MONAHRQ-generated website, visit the MONAHRQ demo site, a full MONAHRQ-generated website created using synthetic data, at monahrq.ahrq.gov/demo/index.html. To see examples of how host users are using the MONAHRQ-generated website, visit one or more of the deployed MONAHRQ websites linked from the MONAHRQ Websites page at monahrq.ahrq.gov/msites.shtml. 0.4.3 The MONAHRQ host application

The MONAHRQ host application is a downloadable Windows desktop software program. It is currently written in C# (but there is no requirement that C# always be used for MONAHRQ). Its user interface, data load capability, internal database, and parts of its data analysis capabilities were originally adopted from the AHRQ Quality Indicators software for Windows. To run, MONAHRQ versions 1.0 to 3.0 require three pieces of supporting software: 1. The Microsoft .NET framework. 2. SQL Server or SQL Server Express. 3. The AHRQ Quality Indicators Risk Adjustment software. According to AHRQ's current plans, MONAHRQ version 4.0 and subsequent versions will no longer require the AHRQ Quality Indicators Risk Adjustment software. Additional details about MONAHRQ's hardware and software requirements can be found in the MONAHRQ Host User Guide. MONAHRQ uses a number of other AHRQ products. Its internal software components and data files include the following: 1. AHRQ's Quality Indicators software for Windows. This component is not expected to be included in MONAHRQ 4.0. 2. Proprietary risk adjustment software from 3M (APR-DRGs, which are used in riskadjustment for AHRQ Quality Indicator hospital mortality measures). This component is not expected to be included in MONAHRQ 4.0. 3. AHRQ's Cost-to-Charge Ratio (CCR) files. 4. AHRQ's Clinical Classification Software (CCS). 5. AHRQ's Comorbidity Software. 6. AHRQ's Prevention Quality Indicators Mapping Tool. 7. AHRQ-produced website builder software. 8. Proprietary MS-DRG grouper software from IRP.

The MONAHRQ Host User Guide provides additional information about the MONAHRQ host application, including detailed screenshots and explanations of the host application's graphical user interface. 0.4.4 Licensing and costs

One MONAHRQ design goalis keeping costs low in order to help lower barriers to healthcare data analysis and quality reporting. AHRQ provides the MONAHRQ software executable for no cost. AHRQ does not, however, currently release MONAHRQ source code. MONAHRQ can be run using free supporting software: the Microsoft .NET framework, the Microsoft SQL Server Express database, and other AHRQ-developed software tools. Currently, MONAHRQ has licensing requirements associated with the AHRQ QI software for Windows and an optional MS-DRG grouper from IRG. Both of these pieces of software are currently embedded in MONAHRQ. According to AHRQ's current plans, MONAHRQ 4.0 and subsequent versions will no longer embed the AHRQ QI Software for Windows. The MONAHRQ name and logo are registered trademarks. 0.5 MONAHRQ dissemination, support, and adoption. This section provides a brief overview of existing MONAHRQ activities related to dissemination, support, and adoption. The MONAHRQ project's success depends not only on the quality of its software, but on factors such as its ability to engage users and potential users, to assess MONAHRQ use, to communicate MONAHRQ's value to stakeholders, to support MONAHRQ users with responsive technical assistance, and to gather and respond to stakeholder feedback and wishes. 0.5.1 MONAHRQ website

The MONAHRQ website is the main source for the MONAHRQ materials and information. It provides software downloads, user documentation, a fact sheet, presentations, news and announcements, a FAQ page, links to known MONAHRQ-generated websites, and links to a live MONAHRQ-generated demo site built from synthetic data, and the My Quality Improvement (MyQI) set of quality improvement guides. 0.5.2 MONAHRQ email list

The MONAHRQ email list sends announcements about new releases, updated documentation, webinars, and other events of interest to the MONAHRQ user community. Interested parties

may sign up on the MONAHRQ website. The MONAHRQ email list currently has over 400 members. 0.5.3 MONAHRQ technical assistance

MONAHRQ technical assistance is available from the MONAHRQ technical support team on request by email or phone. Initial technical assistance responses are provided within two business days. 0.5.4 MONAHRQ Learning Network

A MONAHRQ Learning Network was organized by AHRQ in 2010. Its purpose was to encourage MONAHRQ adoption and to facilitate communication among MONAHRQ users, potential users, and AHRQ. The Learning Network included 36 diverse organizations: community collaboratives, state data associations, local government agencies, hospital associations, individual hospitals, and commercial reporting organizations. Activities included a password-protected extranet, discussion groups, webinars, beta testing opportunities, and two in-person meetings. The Learning Network ended in June 2011. 0.5.5 MONAHRQ User Group

AHRQ is in the early stages of forming a MONAHRQ User Group. The former Learning Network members are the initial members of the User Group mailing list. User group members are expected to be relatively involved MONAHRQ users who have already deployed a MONAHRQ-generated website or are seriously exploring doing so. Potential User Group activities include the mailing list, webinars, feedback interviews, beta testing opportunities, and usability testing opportunities. AHRQ also plans an annual half-day MONAHRQ User Group meeting, potentially held in conjunction with the fall AHRQ Annual Conference, although no such meetings have yet been held. 0.5.6 MONAHRQ adoption

Several states have created statewide reporting websites using MONAHRQ. A current list of known MONAHRQ-generated websites can be found at monahrq.ahrq.gov/msites.shtml. . Numerous other parties are in various stages of exploring MONAHRQ use, as indicated by the number and type of MONAHRQ downloads and technical assistance requests. 0.6 Resources The following lists MONAHRQ resources that provide additional useful information. 0.6.1 Highly recommended resources The main MONAHRQ website provides the MONAHRQ software and information about MONAHRQ.

For a list of suggested data and measures that might be added to MONAHRQ, see the following subsections. Improve MONAHRQ's ability to support new data analysis, communications, and reporting features. Design MONAHRQ so as to make it technically possible to add 2-4 new types of data analysis or reporting features per year. For a list of suggested data analysis and reporting features that might be added to MONAHRQ, see the following subsections. ท Improve MONAHRQ's ability to support a wide array of customization options, both for data processing and analysis and for the MONAHRQ-generated website. Design MONAHRQ so as to make it technically possible to add 2-4 new customization options per year. For a list of suggested customization options that might be added to MONAHRQ, see the following subsections. ท Improve MONAHRQ's ease of use for host users. ท Improve the MONAHRQ-generated website's appearance, stability, and usability. ท Incorporate best practices in the public reporting of health care quality, costs, and other health information. I-2.5.2.1. Data and measures. This section describes AHRQ's current priorities for incorporating additional data and measures into MONAHRQ. While the contractor shall ensure

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 24 of 108

that AHRQ, the MONAHRQ software development team, and the MONAHRQ planning team work together closely to establish requirements during the redesign, AHRQ expects the following information to be pertinent. Currently, MONAHRQ reports the following types of information: 1) quality measures, 2) utilization (number of discharges, length of stay), 3) charge and cost information, and 4) population-based rates using county populations as the denominator and hospital discharges as the numerator. For quality measures, AHRQ expects that in the future MONAHRQ will import and report measure results calculated outside of MONAHRQ. MONAHRQ will not directly calculate these measures, and the MONAHRQ project will not directly engage in measure development. For utilization, cost, and rates information, AHRQ expects that in the future MONAHRQ will continue to load and directly analyze raw data. As part of future MONAHRQ development, it may be necessary to develop auxiliary analytic files that calculate quality measures based on specifications developed by others. In addition, it may be advisable to move calculations for utilization, costs, and rates into auxiliary applications as well. Currently, no such auxiliary applications exist; unless one considers the AHRQ Quality Indicators software, a separate product in its own right, to perform such a function. Current priorities for adding new data and measures to MONAHRQ include the following. The contractor shall expect this list to expand and change in response to external developments. ท Clinical quality measures associated with meaningful use and the Electronic Health Record (EHR). ท Clinical quality measures associated with Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). ท Locally-defined measures. ท Additional AHRQ measures and measure sets (such as the AHRQ Pediatric Quality Measures, or other new measures or measure sets developed by AHRQ in the future). ท Measures of Hospital Acquired Infections or Healthcare Associated Conditions. ท Measures using all-payer, all-claims data. ท Health plan-level measures associated with health insurance exchanges. ท Additional cost and cost savings information. ท Additional Compare measures from CMS (such as Physician Compare, Nursing Home Compare). ท Measures of health care disparities. ท Nursing measures, such as nursing-sensitive quality of care or nursing staffing levels. The contractor shall supply auxiliary applications, formatted data files, benchmarks or other resources required for each new type of data or measures. Once incorporated into MONAHRQ, such additional resources shall be updated and maintained. I-2.5.2.2. Data analysis, communication, and reporting features. This section describes AHRQ's current priorities for expanding and enhancing MONAHRQ's data analysis, communication, and reporting features. While the majority of the features listed below pertain to the MONAHRQ-generate website, AHRQ encourages the contractor to explore more creative ways to communicate healthcare quality information as well. While the contractor shall ensure that AHRQ, the MONAHRQ software development team, and the MONAHRQ planning team

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 25 of 108

work together closely to establish requirements during the redesign, AHRQ expects the following information to be pertinent. Current priorities for expanding and enhancing MONAHRQ's data analysis, communication, and reporting features include the following. The contractor shall expect this list to expand and change in response to external developments. ท Improve MONAHRQ's ability to handle data beyond one calendar year, to which it is currently limited. ท Report time trends across multiple quarters or years. ท Pool data by year or region to accommodate low count events. ท Report quality of care and/or costs using summary or composite measures. ท Report at different geographic levels (e.g., ZIP codes, grouped counties, townships). ท Integrate cost and quality information into displays that allow comparisons among providers. ท Provide more local customization options, within recommended reporting guidelines. ท Add hospital profile pages that encapsulate information about a single hospital. ท Provide more search and stratification options to promote fair comparisons and targeted reports, such as filtering by hospital characteristics, performance levels, or patient characteristics. ท Provide additional information about costs and potential cost savings for policy makers, managers, and quality improvement experts. ท Add the ability to save, print, share, or email reports from within the MONAHRQgenerated website. ท Develop MONAHRQ versions tailored for specific domains, purposes, or audiences, such as pediatric reporting; reporting on specific types of providers, such as health plans or long-term care; reporting about healthcare disparities; reporting to audiences with low health literacy; or reporting to speakers of other languages. ท Develop a mobile accessible version of MONAHRQ. ท Explore innovative methods of communicating quality information (e.g., mobile access, importing quality information into other consumer health applications such as the personal health record).

I-2.5.2.3. The MONAHRQ host user application and customization options. This section describes AHRQ's current priorities for enhancing the MONAHRQ host user application. While the contractor shall ensure that AHRQ, the MONAHRQ software development team, and the MONAHRQ planning team work together closely to establish requirements during the redesign, AHRQ expects the following information to be pertinent. The contractor should expect this list to expand and change in response to external developments. ท Increase the number and types of customization options for MONAHRQ. This item will become increasingly important as MONAHRQ supports new features, data, measures, and tailoring for specific domains. ท Improve the host user application's usability, such as an improved user interface or better error checking. ท Enhance the host user application so as to decrease host users' need for technical assistance, guided by the contractors' log and summary of TA requests. ท Improve the host user application's performance, as it currently may require over 24 hours to create a MONAHRQ-generated website.

I-2.6. Making MONAHRQ open source. AHRQ does not currently release MONAHRQ source code. However, the redesigned version of MONAHRQ shall be open source. This task assesses the advisability and feasibility of making MONAHRQ open source. If advisable and feasible, it determines how to best approach the release of MONAHRQ source code and how to manage MONAHRQ as an open source project. The contractor shall perform a feasibility study and provide recommendations for making MONAHRQ open source. The study and recommendations should address the following strategic concerns at minimum. ท How making MONAHRQ open source can increase the use of MONAHRQ, or otherwise support AHRQ goals such as transparency and public reporting. ท How making MONAHRQ open source can leverage third parties' work in order to improve MONAHRQ or MONAHRQ-related data and software offerings. ท How to avoid letting the release of MONAHRQ source code dilute the MONAHRQ brand or reputation, given that it allows users to create MONAHRQ-branded websites from edited source code over which AHRQ has little control. ท The direct and indirect costs involved with making MONAHRQ open source software. The study and recommendations shall additionally address specific issues that include but are not limited to: ท The timing of the source code release. ท Which sections of the source code to release. ท Licensing agreements or other restrictions associated with source code release. ท Tools with which to manage the released source code and/or versions of the code that have been updated by third parties. ท The nature and amount of technical support that AHRQ will provide to source code users. ท Approaches to helping MONAHRQ source code users share code, share knowledge of MONAHRQ source code, or collaborate on source code changes. ท Approaches to verifying the accuracy and correctness of source code changes. ท Approaches to endorsing or not endorsing MONAHRQ websites created using source code changed by third parties. ท Approaches to incorporating source code changes back into MONAHRQ offerings, such as by updating the main MONAHRQ application, offering separate MONAHRQ modules that extend the main MONAHRQ application, or offering specialized versions of MONAHRQ.

As permitted in FAR 52.227-17, the provisions of this Section H.1 shall apply to any release or use of data first produced in the performance of the Contract and any analysis, tools, methodologies, or recorded product based on such data. (b) Release and Use ญ Requirements related to confidentiality and quality. To ensure public trust in the confidentiality protections afforded participants in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-supported research, AHRQ requires and monitors compliance by its contractors with section 934(c) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)), which states in part that No information, if the establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of activities undertaken or supported under this title, may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless such establishment or person has consented...to its use for such other purpose. Such information may not be published or released in other form if the person who supplied the information or who is described in it is identifiable unless such person has consented...to its publication or release in other form. In addition to this requirement, section 933(b)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299c-2(b)(1)) requires AHRQ to assure that statistics and analyses developed with Agency support are of high quality, comprehensive, timely, and adequately analyzed. Accordingly -(1) prior to the release or use of data based upon work performed under this Contract, the Contractor agrees to consult with the Contracting Officer's Representative and Contract Officers regarding the proposed release or use. The Contractor will in good faith consider, discuss, and respond to any comments or suggested modifications that are provided by AHRQ within two months of receiving the proposed release or use. The purpose of such consultation is to assure that: (A) identifiable information is being used exclusively for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied or appropriate consents have been obtained; (B) the confidentiality promised to individuals and establishments supplying identifiable information or described in it is not violated; and (C) the quality of statistical and analytical work meets the statutory standards cited above. (2) The Contractor must satisfy conditions (1)(A) and (1)(B). At the conclusion of any consultation required by paragraph (b)(1) above, if AHRQ and the Contractor cannot agree that a proposed use or release satisfies condition (1)(C) above:

(A) the research professional at the Contractor responsible for the quality of the Contract work will, in advance of any release or use of such data, certify in a letter to the Contracting Officer what differences of opinion cannot be resolved regarding the statutory standards referenced in condition (1)(C) and the basis for Contractor assertions that these standards have been met; and (B) the Contractor must print prominently on the release or other product, or on any portion that is released, or state prior to any oral presentation or release of such material, the following disclaimer: THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) CONTRACT# . HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. (c) Required Statement Regarding Protected Information. On all written material or other recorded products, or preceding any presentation or other oral disclosure, release or use of material based on identifiable information obtained in the course of work performed under this contract, the Contractor shall make the following statement: IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON WHICH THIS REPORT, PRESENTATION, OR OTHER FORM OF DISCLOSURE IS BASED IS PROTECTED BY FEDERAL LAW, SECTION 934(c) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, 42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c). NO IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES SUPPLYING THE INFORMATION OR DESCRIBED IN IT MAY BE KNOWINGLY USED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PRIOR CONSENT. ANY CONFIDENTIAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT OR PRESENTATION THAT IS KNOWINGLY DISCLOSED IS DISCLOSED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PROVIDED. (d) Copyright ญ Data first produced in the performance of the Contract. Subject to the terms of this Section regarding release and use of data, AHRQ, through its Contracting Officer, will grant permission under FAR 52.227-17(c)(1)(i) to the Contractor to establish claim to copyright subsisting in scientific and technical articles based on or containing data first produced in the performance of this contract that are submitted for publication in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings or similar works. When claim to copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number) to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office. In such circumstances, the Contractor hereby agrees to grant to AHRQ, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of AHRQ.

(e) Subcontracts. Whenever data, analyses, or other recorded products are to be developed by a subcontractor under this Contract, the Contractor must include the terms of H.1 in the subcontract, without substantive alteration, with a provision that the subcontractor may not further assign to another party any of its obligations to the Contractor. No clause may be included to diminish the Government's stated requirements or rights regarding release or use of products or materials based on data derived from work performed under this contract. H.2 LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE OR USE

Failure to submit materials for statutorily mandated confidentiality and statistical and analytic quality reviews as required by Section H.1 of this contract will be viewed as a material violation and breach of the terms of this contract, as the requirements of this provision are necessary for AHRQ to carry out its statutory obligations and responsibilities. Records of the Contractor's performance, including the Contractor's performance pertaining to this Contract, will be maintained in AHRQ's Contracts Management Office and will be considered as an element of past performance which is part of all subsequent competitive contract proposal reviews. H.3 SUBCONTRACTS

These requirements are to be included without substantive alteration, and no clause may be included to diminish these requirements.

H.5

SALARY RATE LIMITATION

(a) Pursuant to the current and applicable prior HHS appropriations acts, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the federal Executive Schedule Level I* in effect on the date an expense is incurred. *(Please note: The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, which restricts the amount of direct salary, was revised from Executive Level I to Executive Level II.)

(b) For purposes of the salary rate limitation, the terms ``direct salary,'' ``salary,'' and ``institutional base salary'' have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as ``direct salary'' in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's direct effort (costs) under the contract. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs). (NOTE: The salary rate limitation does not restrict the salary that an organization may pay an individual working under an HHS contract or order; it merely limits the portion of that salary that may be paid with federal funds.) (c) The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals under subcontracts. If this is a multipleyear contract or order, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract or order funding. (d) See the salaries and wages pay tables on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management website for federal Executive Schedule salary levels that apply to the current and prior periods. H.6 PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS BACKGROUND The Office of Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), requires that all DHHS employees and contractor employees (including subcontractors) who will be working in a DHHS-owned or leased space and/or who will have access to DHHS equipment, and non-public privileged, proprietary, or trade secret information, undergo a background investigation. GENERAL Notwithstanding other submission requirements stated elsewhere in this contract, the contractor shall appoint and identify a Contractor Security Representative and submit the following information for each employee to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days after contract award.

Upon receipt of the ID Badge Request Form and E-QIP Initiation Form, a security specialist from PSC will email the contractor with instructions on completing the on-line background investigation questionnaire and making arrangements for the contractor to complete the electronic fingerprints at the Parklawn Building. H.7 ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCES S IBILITY,HHS AR 352.239-73(b ), (J ANUARY 2010)

(a) Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR Part 1194. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm. (b) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this contract/order are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. The Contractor must provide a written Section 508 conformance certification due at the end of each contract/order exceeding $150,000 when the contract/order duration is one year or less. If it is determined by the Government that EIT products and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the Contractor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense. (c) In the event of a modification(s) to this contract/order, which adds new EIT products or services or revises the type of, or specifications for, products or services the Contractor is to provide, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor submit a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template to assist the Government in determining that the EIT products or services support Section 508 accessibility standards. Instructions for documenting accessibility via the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability website (http://www.hhs.gov/od/). (d) Prior to the Contracting Officer exercising an option for a subsequent performance period/additional quantity or adding funding for a subsequent performance period under this contract, as applicable, the Contractor must provide a Section 508 Annual Report to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer Representative. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer in writing, the Contractor shall provide the cited report in accordance with the following schedule. Instructions for completing the report are available in the Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability website under the heading Vendor Information and Documents. The Contractor's failure to submit a timely and properly completed report may jeopardize the Contracting Officer's exercising an option or adding funding, as applicable.

Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). Restriction on disclosure and use of data. (1) The proposal submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade secrets; business data (e.g., commercial information, financial information, cost and pricing data); and technical data) which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following statements, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be restricted: "Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), data contained in the portions of this proposal which the offeror has specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes. The offeror acknowledges that HHS may not be able to withhold a record (e.g., data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the HHS' FOI officials must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if HHS has determined that disclosure is required by the Act.

(e)

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 86 of 108

If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall have the right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act. The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act. The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages (insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other identification)." (2) In addition, the offeror must mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following statement: "Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation.'' (3) Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive statements or statements differing in substance from those cited above may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with nonconforming statement(s). (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. A summary of the rationale for award. For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

Ele c tro n ic a n d In fo rm a tio n Te c h n o lo g y Ac c e s s ib ility, (January 2010) HHS AR 352.239-73(a )
a. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit-- 1. Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.

2.

b.

Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotations/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 visions is available at http://www.section508.gov/ . The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm .

AHRQ-12-10011 Page 89 of 108

c.

The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability Web site ( http://www.hhs.gov/od/ ). Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government -- i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense.

AHRQ Application and System Development Requirements
AHRQ has implemented a Distributed Systems Engineering Lab (DSEL) to support all internal development efforts and provide the facility for housing the software and documentation for all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted. AHRQ uses a System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework which is consistent with the HHS Enterprise Lifecycle Framework (EPLC). This framework is the basis for implementation of the DSEL, conduct of development projects and the Rational Unified Process (RUP)/Capability Maturity Model (CMM) based processes that support its implementation. The SDLC framework provides a disciplined approach which employs the following traditional project phases: ท ท ท ท ท ท ท ท ท ท Concept Initiation Planning Requirements Analysis Design Development Testing Implementation / Deployment Operations and Maintenance Retirement

The AHRQ SDLC framework is closely aligned with the disciplines defined in the Rational Unified Process (RUP). The IBM Rational Suite of tools has been adopted by the Agency to provide a standard IT development environment for AHRQ sponsored systems and application development projects. The AHRQ SDLC framework has been enhanced through the use of tailored processes and artifacts based on the RUP methodology. The documentation deliverables required for all Information Technology (IT) projects are based on specific RUP artifacts identified by ARHQ. The Rational ClearCase libraries housed within the DSEL provide the repository for housing software and documentation artifacts related to all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted. Contractors are not required to follow the RUP development methodology or use the Rational Suite of tools; however, the Contractor's SDLC must be capable of producing AHRQ required system deliverables containing the required content as described further in the following section. It is required that the Contractor use the lifecycle phases defined in the AHRQ SDLC framework and obtain PO approval before moving from one phase to another. The contractor must also conform to AHRQ Configuration Management (CM) and change control standards which require appropriate controls for managing software and documentation baselines, changes to software artifacts using an appropriate IDE or version management tool, document change requests and obtaining approval through a formal change control process that requires Project Officer (PO) and possible AHRQ IT approval prior to implementation. The following table describes the documentation deliverables required for all IT projects and the content required for each deliverable.

System Documentation

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-1011 Attachment E

The Contractor will provide to the Agency system documentation of all proposed hardware, software, security, backup/recovery, and other information technology infrastructure and components and solutions needed to support this project. The documentation is to be delivered to the Project Officer for review and approval for each release. This documentation will be provided according to the content standards specified by AHRQ and will be maintained in the Agency's Rational ClearCase Repository as a unique project library created and maintained by the AHRQ CM Manager. All documentation will be baselined with each system release. In addition, the source code for each production release will be delivered and stored in the same project library as the documentation artifacts. The contractor will be required to update these baselined artifacts for each production release of the system. Sample documents and templates for the required documentation artifacts are available as guidance. The following documents as mentioned in Table 1.1, "Documentation Deliverables", are required by AHRQ.

Project Initiation Document
The Project Initiation Document (PID) is intended to be a statement of purpose and scope for initiating a given project and a guide to manage expectations in both process and deliverables throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The PID defines the business case for the project by defining the purpose, the milestones, resources, objectives, costs, risks including mitigation strategies, and the artifacts and IT technologies (architecture) utilized and produced for, and during, the project. The PID serves as the formal funding commitment document approved by the COTR and Stakeholders. Additionally, the PID must be approved by AHRQ IT management, and in some cases, the AHRQ Information Technology Review Board (ITRB) for technical viability, adherence to Agency Enterprise Architecture (EA); technical standards and formal Project Management requirements as derived from Departmental standards and accepted Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) standards. In the case of external development contracts, the PID is satisfied by the formal proposal submitted by the vendor and accepted by AHRQ.

Project Work Plan
The System Project Plan or Project Work Plan (PWP) provides a method to assign and track the project resources, hours and specific deliverables. This plan provides the detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and resource loading that can be used to identify project costs and is intended for the project manager to track the schedule and cost of a project, including development of Earned Value Management (EVM) measures. The PWP is delineated by the phases of the project which include Project Initiation, Generation of the PWP Schedule, Requirements Gathering, System Design, System Development, System Testing including User Acceptance, System Deployment and System Support and production of project deliverables which require COTR or Stakeholder acceptance and signoff to continue project tasks identified in the PWP.

System Requirements Document
The System Requirements Document (SRD) contains the system requirements, use cases and supplementary specifications that provide the basis for design and development of the system. The following information is provided for each requirement identified in the document:

Requirement ID, Name and Title Requirement Description Software Release Version Use Case Model Use Case Specifications Supplementary Specifications

A text-based Functional Requirements Document may be provided instead of a Use Case Model, Use Case Specifications, and Supplementary Specifications.

Requirements Traceability Matrix
The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) associates requirements with the work products that satisfy them. This matrix is created at the beginning of a project's lifecycle to trace the requirements from identification through testing. The project elements are traced as they relate to other project elements, especially those related to requirements. The purpose of establishing traceability is to help understand the sources of requirements, manage the scope of the project, manage changes to requirements; assess the project impact of a change in a requirement; and verify that all requirements of the system are fulfilled by the implementation. The following values are required for the traceability matrix:

ท ท ท ท ท ท

Requirement ID and Title; The version of the system in which the requirement will be implemented; The Use Case to which the requirement can be traced; The version of the design document in which the requirement is implemented; The ID of the test script in which the requirement is tested; The version number of the source code in which the requirement is implemented.

The figure below shows a sample of the data traced through a project's life cycle.

System Design Document
The System Design Document (SDD) details the design and implementation of all custom software features of the system. The design descriptions must include use cases that detail the interaction which occurs between a user and the system. The document describes the general nature of the system, and describes the architecturally significant parts of the design model, such as its decomposition into subsystems and packages. For each significant package, a section of the document should detail its decomposition into classes and class utilities. Architecturally significant classes should be introduced and a description of their responsibilities should accompany the introduction. Any significant relationships, operations, and attributes should be detailed in this document. The document should be organized by use case, so that it provides traceability back to the initial requirements. The document must also contain a description of the database model and data elements used to support the application. This data can be referenced to an appropriately maintained Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and data definitions which conform to CM standards and are appropriately maintained in the Rational CM Libraries.

Test Plan

The purpose of the Test Plan is to define the approach for testing a particular application or system. The Test Plan is a high level description of the testing process which will be performed. The Test Plan outlines the types of testing to be performed, the requirements to be tested, the test environment, testing tools, pass/fail criteria and a risk assessment. At a minimum the document should contain the following: A. Test Description

Web Product and Web Site Development Guidelines
The following list highlights basic issues that need to be addressed when developing Web tools or sites under contract that will be publicly available when launched to ensure deliverables are on target, in compliance with legal and policy requirements, and do not require expensive rework to meet Federal and Department of Health and Human Services requirements for information resources. Guidelines for Web-Based Products Retrofitting Web-based products after the fact is highly undesirable because it adds time and costs to the process of making these products publicly available. All products that are developed with the intent of being posted on the AHRQ Web site should meet the following minimum requirements: Titles of Products Coordinate with your project officer on the titles of your products. They need to be concise and relevant to the purpose of the project, but cannot include the name of the contractor or grantee as the performing organization as part of the title. Report titles should be no more than 10-words maximum and Web-based tools should be no more than 5-words maximum (make every word count--eliminate initial articles such as "The" or "A" ). Titles need to be distinct enough to differentiate among similar sounding products. Quality Control/Editorial Review This involves checking for spelling and grammar mistakes, formatting issues, general consistency, and style. This should be done by the AHRQ grantee or contractor prior to submission of the final product for posting on the AHRQ Web site. Federal resources follow the GPO Style Manual which is available electronically at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html Accessibility As an agency of the Federal Government, AHRQ must ensure that anything that is posted on our Web site is in compliance with requirements for information resources under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Also, federally funded resources need to be generally available to users in multiple formats to ensure that we are not forcing a particular platform, operational system, or proprietary software package on users. Intellectual Property Rights Before we can post a product on the AHRQ Web site, we must have a written explanation of the following four questions: ท ท ท ท Who retains the copyright? Who has licenses for what purposes and uses? What are the constraints imposed? Who grants permission for further use or adoption?

Usability

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-1011 Attachment E

Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are designed to facilitate. A set of Research-Based Web Design and Usability Guidelines that should be consulted are available at: http://www.usability.gov/guidelines/index.html Beta testing prior to release is desirable, evaluating the product against usability heuristics. As feedback is received and products are updated, the revisions will need to be designated by version number and date of release. Privacy Act Protections Web resources are subject to the Privacy Act and this can impact both the development of Web-based tools and the users of those tools. Persistent cookies should not be programmed into the functionality of a Web-based tool, although session cookies are allowed. Registration for use cannot be requested if this would involve collection of individual identifiers from the users. Although exemptions to both rules can be sought, this involves a strong justification and several levels of review for approval through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Guidelines for Web Sites Web sites being supported through contracts are considered Federal information resources and as such are required to be in compliance with laws, policies, and directives that affect such resources. This includes content management and information categorization, including standard metadata, under the E-Gov Act requirements and Office of Management and Budget issuances to Federal agencies on IT resources. For recommendations and guidance on requirements and best practices, go to: http://www.firstgov.gov/webcontent/reqs_bestpractices/best_practices.shtml Clearance Web resources require clearance by HHS--including justification against a set of criteria. Publications cleared for printing are cleared for Web uploading at the same time. Web resources must comply with the numerous laws and directives that affect federally funded electronic information resources. Web content loaded on a site by contractors must be appropriate and follow all laws and directives. AHRQ Offices and Centers must coordinate initial review through AHRQ's Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) before launch, and OCKT will coordinate departmental clearance. Domain Names All domain names for any Web resource funded in whole or in part by Federal funds must be registered as .gov through HHS with the General Services Administration (GSA). Although other domains, such as .org, .net, .edu, .com may also be reserved by the Agency, the .gov domain must be registered and that domain name will need to be indexed by FirstGov, the GSA portal to government-funded resources. The FirstGov link is then required on the home page of the site. Coordinate with OCKT on domain name requests. Editorial Review

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-1011 Attachment E

All content for upload needs to be reviewed to ensure consistency and compliance with best practices and established style and conventions. As a minimum, the copy needs to be production edited to ensure there are no typos and the GPO Style Manual is followed for punctuation, spelling, use of numerals, abbreviations, etc. Do not use unexplained acronyms; they need to be spelled out on first reference in any document or file. There should not be anything marked DRAFT on a public site. Once the materials are uploaded, they are published and considered in the "public domain." Do not use placeholders for content that does not exist. Government funded sites should not have anything designated "under construction." A process needs to be established for regular review of content and updating. Additional materials need to undergo editorial review and be approved before uploading. The GPO Style Guide is available electronically as a reference at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html Accessibility Under the Rehabilitation Act, Federal agencies have an obligation to provide equal access for the disabled to their information and services. Requirements are specified in section 504 for individual accommodation and more recently in section 508 for electronic and information technology, which includes Web sites and multimedia products. Equivalent alternatives are required for auditory and visual information, such as providing alternative descriptive text for images for the blind and providing captions for audio-video files for the deaf. Written transcripts are required for all streaming audio. PDF files can be offered in conjunction with accessible files, such at HTML versions, but avoid uploading PDF-only versions of documents unless they are fully accessible PDF formats. OCKT has software used to evaluate Web sites and can provide a report on any accessibility violations that would need to be addressed before launch. Specific requirements are available at: http://www.section508.gov Privacy A privacy policy notice must be prominently displayed, and the Web site host has to follow it. A machine-readable format (P3P) of the privacy policy notice must also be uploaded to the site. A Privacy Impact Assessment is conducted to determine what kind of personal information is contained within a system, what is done with that information, and how that information is protected. Sites are periodically audited to ensure that they observe their stated privacy policy. A Privacy Act System notice may need to be prepared and published for users to register on a site if the registrations represent a group of records, under the control of the Agency (or a contractor), that can be retrieved by personal identifier. This notice must go through several levels of review--including the Office of General Counsel-and be published in the Federal Register. Persistent cookies cannot be used on Federal sites unless the Secretary of HHS grants an exemption, and this involves a strong justification and review process. Web Site Mailbox Every Web site must provide full contact information for the sponsor and have a Contact Us link for submission of comments or questions as a customer feedback mechanism. Web site e-mail is subject to the same privacy and records management issues that affect the overall Web site as well as departmental standards for handling inquiries and customer feedback. Each Web site must provide relevant Frequently Asked Questions that are included in the customer relationship management system used to handle AHRQ Web site inquiries. Records Management

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-1011 Attachment E

All content on the site and e-mail generated by the site must be archived electronically and handled according to records retention schedules and disposition authorities as established with the National Archives and Record Administration. This requirement also affects Web site log files and statistical reporting on Web site usage. For guidance on requirements, go to: http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/managing-web-records-index.html Information Collection Budget If a Web site is used to collect information from users, such as for surveys, evaluations, or beta testing feedback, then the Office of Management and Budget must first approve the burden hours for such an effort for this collection. A notice must be posted on the Web site at the point of collection with the OMB approval number and a statement on the process of collection. Intellectual Property Copyright and trademark protections need to be observed on Web sites. Permissions for use must be granted for any copyrighted information included and registered trademarks need to be reflected in copy. Any copyright or trademark constraints related to materials uploaded to a site must be specified for users. Public domain does not extend outside the borders of the United States. Therefore, foreign countries must request specific permission for use. Given the global nature of the Internet, citation as to source is a critical issue. Linking External links constitute an implied endorsement and create a business advantage for the linked sites. OMB requires Agencies to do a risk assessment of external links, and potential links need to be assessed against the HHS and AHRQ linking policies and criteria. If a site deviates from these policies, then the specific review and selection criteria must be justified and posted on the Web site for full disclosure. Outside Web resources may link to Agency resources providing that the link is not displayed in any way that would imply an endorsement by the Agency of a specific commercial product or service. Electronic FOIA The Agency is required by law to have an electronic FOIA reading room and to provide materials that can be requested under the Freedom of Information Act in electronic form, if so requested. HHS requires that any Web resource funded by the Agency provide a link to the AHRQ Freedom of Information Act page on the main AHRQ Web site. Usability Web resources should include usability testing, evaluation, and modification as an integral and recurring part of the development effort to ensure they are effective for the electronic business processes they are supposed to facilitate. Go to http://www.usability.gov as a reference for best practices in initial development or redesign of Web resources. Web Sponsor Identity AHRQ has uniform principles to identify AHRQ as the primary sponsor of AHRQ-related Web sites. These principles reflect HHS best practices for a consistent look and feel of Web

Request for Proposal MONAHRQ

AHRQ-12-1011 Attachment E

resources, reinforce credibility, and support HHS and Agency branding efforts. The four specific principles that should be consistent across all AHRQ-funded Web sites are: ท Web site URL name: The name of a Web site should always contain AHRQ in the URL. A Web resource should either be a folder on the main AHRQ Web site (www.ahrq.gov/chiri) or a third-level domain of the Web site (www.webmm.ahrq.gov). Title of Web site project: AHRQ's name should be part of the formal title and appear at the beginning of the Web site's project name when referenced in print or promotional materials. For example: AHRQ's Web Morbidity and Mortality online journal. HHS and AHRQ logos: The HHS and AHRQ logos should be featured prominently on the Web site and in materials that are used to market that Web site. Web site home page format: The Web site home page should have common design and navigation elements with the HHS Portal and the AHRQ Web site so that all Web sites look as though they belong to the Department and AHRQ Web family. All AHRQ domain sites must include a standard banner and footer that are branded for Web resources. Technical specifications and templates for developers to consult when designing Web resources are provided by the AHRQ Web Manager.
