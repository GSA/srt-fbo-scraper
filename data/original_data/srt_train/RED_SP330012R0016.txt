To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

It is not permissible for offerors to use offeror created CLINs/SLINs.

This information will be utilized to determine the level of confidence the Government has for successful performance based upon the Offeror's actions under previously awarded, and relevant contracts. The Offeror shall identify up to three (3) of its most relevant efforts within the past five (5) years, and provide any other information the Offeror considers relevant to the requirements of the solicitation. Offerors should provide a detailed explanation of the contracts or efforts to the requirements of the solicitation. If subcontractor experience is provided as part of the THREE most relevant contracts, it will be given weight relative to the percentage of effort being provided by that particular subcontractor in the offer submitted. The references will be evaluated in the aggregate in order to allow Offerors who may not have the entire scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement under one individual contract to still be considered relevant if experience with the full scope, magnitude, and complexity of the requirement can be demonstrated within the allotted number of references as described above. The Offeror must demonstrate execution of three (3) or more contracts in the last five (5) years to be considered to have a sufficient Past Performance Record. If an Offeror or its subcontractor determines they have no past performance data, they shall provide the following statement in lieu of the information request below: "(Insert Offeror or subcontractor's name) has determined that they possess no past performance information IAW the RFP".

Documentation that demonstrates that the offeror is a certified Gigamon reseller/distributor. (The Government may contact Gigamon to confirm that the offeror is a certified Gigamon reseller/distributor); Contractors are required to include a copy of the FAR Provision 52.212-3-Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items and DFARS Provision 252.212-7000-Offeror Representation and CertificationCommercial Items with its proposal or may indicate completion of the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov; Signed acknowledgements of amendments (SF 30).

EVALUATION OF OFFERS: The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, as supplemented. Past Performance shall be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), Past Performance Evaluation). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance.

The Government intends to award one (1) Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract as a result of this Request for Proposals (RFP). Award will be based on the total overall lowest price proposed that provides satisfactory past performance information and brand name equipment requested in the required delivery timeframe. Price reasonableness will be determined through price analysis in accordance with FAR 15.402. The Government will utilize a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. Normally, adequate price competition establishes price reasonableness (see FAR 15.403-1(c)(1)). In addition, the Government may utilize a comparison of previously proposed prices and previous Government historical and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items, if both the validity of the comparison and the reasonableness of the previous price(s) can be established. The Government intends to award without discussions; therefore, the initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.

(End of Provision) Questions regarding this solicitation should be emailed to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Rafael E. Dixon at rafael.dixon@dla.mil Close of Business (COB) 9 July 2012.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.
