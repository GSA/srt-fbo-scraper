52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that
--

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared
ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

                  o Pearl Harbor, Hawaii
                  o Manama, Bahrain


Future locations – When licensed, vendor products may be used at any other DISA or DISA approved locations worldwide where DISA CSD may acquire
an operational responsibility.


c.  Non-Production Software Usage - DISA shall have the right to use the licensed software to perform non-production business operations.  There
shall be no additional charge for non-production usage of the software, regardless of the capacity thresholds established in the contract.
These non-production business operations are critical to the success of computing services for the DoD and include, but are not limited to, the
following areas:
      • Quality Assurance / Quality Acceptance (QA) testing; Compatibility Assurance testing
      • Release Management Factory (RMF) testing and distribution
      • Disaster Recovery (DR) / Continuity of Operations (COOP) / Assured Computing Environment (ACE) testing
      • DR/COOP standby systems (with software loaded and configured to run), on hardware maintained in a “cold” (non-started) status

d.  New and/or current software, version releases, and/or maintenance fixes will be subjected to a quality assurance and centralized
installation compatibility assurance checkout at a DISA facility on a test domain. This test domain may or may not be on the same Central
Processing Unit for which the software is licensed. Software being subjected to installation compatibility assurance checkout WILL NOT be made
available for production or development use or execution, and will be distributed only to licensed DISA internal customers. Products containing
passwords/access codes scheduled for installation on the compatibility assurance checkout host will require work around instructions, to be
supplied by the vendor at no additional cost to the government.


f. New and/or current software, version releases, and/or maintenance fixes will be free of embedded lockout codes that require periodic renewal
during the contract performance period. A single embedded code that encompasses the entire performance period will be permitted.

   Software Keys:
     1) The contractor shall provide global passwords / product keys that are not Model number or Serial number dependent / specific.
     2) The contractor shall provide a 24/7 vendor key support contact (primary and alternate).
     3) After a software key request is submitted, the contractor shall deliver the key not later than 24 hours after the initial request.
     4) In the case of an emergency key request, the contractor shall deliver the key not later than 2 hours after the initial request.
     5) The contractor shall accept the Standardized Software key request as illustrated in Addendum 5, License Key Request (LKRF).
     6) The contractor shall send all keys to a central email box.
     7) Currently, due to transformation, more than one account may be active for DISA software maintenance.  To eliminate confusion and
        increase efficiency, the contractor shall standardize all DISA accounts to identify all products as being owned by "DISA."

g. The Sustainment Division (CD55) of DISA CSD may, dependent upon format of documentation receipt, duplicate and distribute, or make available
through access to restricted (disa.mil) web site software documentation to authorized users. CD55 will reproduce or upload all legends, logos,
and proprietary notices and ensure that copy quality is maintained.

h. The Government shall have the right to distribute Vendor products to the appropriately licensed Computing Centers via the Defense Information
Systems Agency (DISA) Release Management Factory (RMF). The RMF is the process for technicians to download software versus installing software
from vendor-provided tapes or cartridges.
Vendor products are loaded in the RMF domain in a generic install configuration, with minimal site customization. CD55 then provides the
Computing Centers with the SMP/E work, naming standards/conventions, customization parameters, and more precise installation instructions as
related to the DISA operating environment.

The RMF is a web-based system using IBM's Websphere Application Server and operates on a host at DECC Mechanicsburg. The host may or may not be
on the same CPU on which the Vendor products are licensed. Vendor products loaded in the RMF are for distribution only and will not be used for
production or development.

The RMF is secured by specific userid login. Security protocols involve the use of the RACF security package on the mainframe to grant/restrict
access to the area of the CD55 web site which allows Computing Center technicians to download software. A signed DISA Form 41 must be submitted
to CD55-Mechanicsburg before any access is granted. The RMF operates on secure network and follows MVS Security Technical Implementation
Guideline (STIG) and Field Security Office (FSO) guidelines.

i. DISA has the right to increase and decrease products within the inventory.  License and maintenance charges associated with increases and
decreases with be adjusted accordingly IAW license and maintenance pricing within this contract.  Where pricing does not exist within this
contract, license and maintenance pricing will not exceed GSA pricing.

j.  Audits -  DISA will conduct, manage and certify all inventory software audits.  No more than one audit may be requested during the life of
the contract.  The time period for the software audit is restricted to the date of contract award and going forward, with the end of the audit
period coinciding with the expiration date of the contract.  If the vendor requests an audit, the vendor will only be provided licensing
information for the period of the contract.    The contractor shall provide a one-hundred twenty (120) day advanced notification in writing to
the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) when requesting an audit.  The written notification must accompany the reason for the audit request
and the specifics of the audit (e.g., what information / details does the contractor want to see from the audit, suggested timeframes, scope of
the audit, identification of authorized contractor POCs for receiving / reviewing audit results, etc,.).  DISA will not unreasonably withhold
its consent to the audit.  The audit will only include DISA owned/managed/maintained non-classified equipment.  The contractor and/or any
authorized agent(s) representing the contractor shall not gain physical or electronic access to DISA networks, systems or processing
environments.  The resource costs incurred by DISA due to the contractor-requested Software Product audit shall be reimbursable by the
contractor and used to offset contract costs.  The contractor shall ensure that appropriate measures, processes and resources will be in place
to maintain the integrity and security of the information exchanged.  If the vendor has a product or a means to conduct an audit then DISA will
be granted a full and continuous, unrestricted right to use such procedures to ensure future compliance during the life of this contract.  At
contract expiration, the Vendor has no rights to audit DISA or request claims for this contract and/or previous contracts.  Any noted
discrepancy during the audit by either party in terms of product version, usage or quantities will be identified immediately and the two parties
will take immediate action to resolve the discrepancy.  Any agreed upon discrepancy that increases/decreases license usage or quantities,
changes contract documented product versions, or changes the original terms and conditions of the contract will be captured in a contract
modification.   Failure to reach an agreement on a particular discrepancy shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR
52.233-1, Disputes.

k. End of Term Provisions - Software products in active and excess inventory at expiration or termination of the contract shall constitute the
inventory of record going forward.  Unless otherwise designated, licenses currently covered under this contract are perpetual and may be used
without Vendor provided maintenance.  The right to receive maintenance, new releases, etc., is provisional based on DISA paying the appropriate
annual maintenance fees.  Maintenance may be acquired annually through agreement by the parties concerning payment of fees to be made.  If
agreement cannot be reached, DISA may renew maintenance by paying the annual maintenance based upon Vendor's GSA schedule, with maintenance
pricing not to exceed GSA pricing.  If no GSA schedule is in effect, or if individual products are no longer in the GSA schedule, annual
maintenance can be renewed for a period not to exceed one year at the current prices in the contract.

l.  Product Loan Agreements (PLA) - DISA may request use of a product for demonstration, testing, and/or assessing a product for possible use in
the enterprise.  In the event a product not currently licensed is obtained for demonstration, testing, and/or assessing, IAW DISA Acquisition
Regulation Supplement, a Product Loan Agreement (PLA) shall be completed.  The Contracting Officer is the only DISA official authorized to enter
into a PLA. 

m.   No other Software License Agreement can supersede these terms and contract unless expressly signed by the Government Contracting Officer.
Pop-up acceptance and/or click/wrap does not constitute changes to the terms of this contract.

n.  Annually, the Government will conduct an inventory reconciliation.  The inventory will be shared with the contractor for preparing the
upcoming annual maintenance renewal contract.  Any noted discrepancy by either party in terms of product version, usage or quantities will be
identified immediately and the two parties will take immediate action to resolve the discrepancy.  Any discrepancy that increases/decreases
license usage or quantities, changes contract documented product versions, or changes the original terms and conditions of the contract will be
captured in a contract modification.   At the conclusion of the inventory reconciliation and the two parties’ mutual agreement to its findings,
the inventory will become the baseline for the upcoming contract maintenance renewal. Additionally, at contract renewal or expiration of the
current contract the contractor agrees to release and discharge the Government of and from all liabilities, obligations, claims and demands
whatsoever arising out of or under this contract.

o.  By contractor acceptance of this contract, contractor agrees that DISA has, at a minimum, sufficient entitlement rights to install/use
contractors’s software products up to the renewed license maintenance/support quantities as specified in this order.  Acceptance of this
contract constitutes closure of all previous contracts and contractor has no rights to audit DISA or request claims for this contract and
previous contracts.




SECTION 508
Section 508 Requirements

      a.  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies acquiring Electronic and Information
      Technology (EIT) to ensure that Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to
      the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities.


      b.  All EIT procured under this contract/order must meet the following 36 CFR     1194 accessibility standards.  The full text of the
      accessibility standards is available at: http://www.accessboard.gov/sec508/508standards.htm


            _x_ 1194.21 – Software Applications and Operating Systems
           ___ 1194.22 – Web Based Intranet and Internet Information and
                       Applications

            _x_ 1194.31 – Functional Performance Criteria

      c.  The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology
      device(s), but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and device(s) so that it can be made accessible if so required
      in the future.


      d.  Contractors may propose products or services that result in substantially equivalent or greater access to and use by individuals with
      disabilities; this is known as equivalent facilitation.
