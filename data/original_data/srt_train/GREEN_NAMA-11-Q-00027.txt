This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for
Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement
constitutes the only solicitation; fixed price quotations are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number
is NAMA-11-Q-0027 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ), and quotations furnished are not offers.  This request does not commit the
government to pay any costs incurred in the preparation of the submission of this quotation or to contract for supplies or services.  Any
representations and/or certifications attached to this RFQ must be completed by the vendor.  The solicitation document and incorporated
provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-50 effective March 16, 2011.  COMPETITION: This is an
unrestricted procurement, subject to full and open competition.  EVALUATION: The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial
quote without discussions of this procurement. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting
Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation.   Award will be made to the offeror whose conforming quotation in
response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this award will be obtained through a lowest priced technically
acceptable evaluation.  For evaluation purposes, the firm-fixed price for each contract line item (CLIN) will be determined by multiplying the
Unit Price by the Maximum Quantity of units, and the Total firm fixed price will be determined by totaling the firm-fixed price of each CLIN.
The Government will only accept commercial-off-the-shelf items.  Contractors must submit itemized specifications—that address each enumerated
requirement of Enclosure 5, Salient Characteristics—for each quoted item to facilitate a comprehensive Government evaluation.  Section 508
Evaluation Factors- Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for receipt of the contract after it has been determined that the
quotation adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508.  Only quotations which contain adequate information to document their
responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (completed Enclosure 4, Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT)) will be
eligible for any additional merit consideration.  CONTRACT TYPE: The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to award an
indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract.  This anticipated contract shall be comprised of a CLIN that utilizes firm fixed unit prices
for the purpose of effectuating orders.  The Government guarantees that it will place orders for, at the very least, the Minimum Quantity for
each CLIN with the successful vendor.  The initial order will be placed immediately following award.  NARA may issue additional orders to the
successful firm from the Date of Award through September 30, 2011, up to the Maximum Quantity listed.  REQUIREMENTS: See Enclosure 1, Schedule
of Prices.  F.O.B. Destination pricing is requested for CLIN 0001, all delivery costs must be included in total firm fixed unit price.  Submit
pricing in accordance with the aforementioned directions and table in Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  See Enclosure 5, Salient Characteristics
for specifications.  DELIVERY: Packaging must be in a manner that prevents damage to the equipment during shipment.  Delivery must be undertaken
during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, unless mutually agreed upon by NARA and the Contractor.  Deliveries will be made in
accordance with Enclosure 2, Delivery Schedule.  ORDERING PERIOD: Date of Award through September 30, 2011.  AFFIRMATION STATEMENTS: Contractors
must include the Trade Agreement Act (TAA) Country of Production in their quotation submissions in order to assist with verification of TAA
compliance.  Contractors must confirm in their quote that all products quoted meet the Energy Star® energy use requirements.  Section 508
Program Need - Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be
relevant for the following program need: "Computer Monitors."  Section 508 Deliverable Requirements - Technical standards from 36 CFR part 1194
Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and
Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those technical provisions identified as applicable in Enclosure 4, Government
Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).  Functional performance criteria from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart C have been determined to apply to
this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at
least those functional performance criteria identified as applicable in Enclosure 4.  Information, documentation, and support requirements from
36 CFR part 1194 Subpart D have been determined to apply to this acquisition.  Solicitation respondents must describe how the information,
documentation, and support proposed for Computer Monitors deliverables meet at least those information, documentation, and support requirements
identified as applicable in Enclosure 4.  Section 508 Acceptance Criteria - Computer Monitors delivered as a result of this solicitation will be
accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility.  Computer Monitors delivered must include a
completed GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of this solicitation.   It is the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure that NARA is not
provided either counterfeit or grey market products.  In the event that such IT products are determined to be counterfeit or grey market, NARA
will seek all available legal remedies including criminal prosecution.  Counterfeit information technology product means any item of information
technology (IT), including hardware and software that is an unauthorized copy, replica, or substitute.  A grey market or gray market also known
as parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by
the original manufacturer[1].  As a result manufacturers will not honor associated warranties and service agreements.  In an effort to further
ensure NARA is receiving new, manufacturer approved Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) items and will receive the benefits of any warranties
or other manufacturer guarantees, NARA requires contractors to submit with their quote, proof in writing from the OEM manufacturer of their
status as an authorized/certified OEM Contractor of the manufactured items.  Unless you, the Contractor, are authorized by the manufacturer to
resell the particular items you are quoting in the USA to the U.S. Federal Government, it is in your best interest as well as the Government’s
that you simply not respond.  NARA will verify with the manufacturer that the Contractor is an authorized reseller for this buy.  Any issues
with the information provided by the manufacturer to the Government about the grey market status of the items must be addressed by the
Contractor to the manufacturer.  The Government will immediately cancel any order based on a quotation of grey market items.  Contractors must
complete and return Enclosure 3, Required Quote Information, and Enclosure 4, Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT), in order
for their quotations to be considered.  QUESTIONS: Questions regarding this RFQ must be submitted in writing to Ms. Evelyn Carter no later than
4:00 PM ET on March 31, 2011 to be considered.  Questions submitted in any other manner will not be answered.  The Government will answer
questions or requests for clarification via a written RFQ amendment.  RFQ CLOSE DATE: Two copies of each quotation should be mailed to National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Attention: Evelyn Carter – Contractor Support, 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 3340, College Park, MD 20740-
6001 or e-mailed to: evelyn.carter@nara.gov . Quotations should be received by 4:00 PM ET on April 8, 2011.  Please allow one extra business day
for delivery and receipt if quotation is sent via e-mail, as the e-mail will need to pass through IT security. Telephonic responses will not be
processed.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant fixed
price IDIQ contract, with the exception of FAR provisions which will be removed prior to issuance of the contract:

                                             GOVERNMENT PRODUCT/SERVICE ACCESSIBILITY TEMPLATE (GPAT)

|The GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as |
|a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable    |
|Section 508 requirements. The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding to the six technical        |
|sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth      |
|tables correspond to accessibility information about information content deliverables and labor hours, respectively.                                                                              |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard. Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified |
|by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for  |
|this acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed EIT        |
|accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information.                         |

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.



    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the Contractor
      in providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the Contractor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the Contractor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is
      also an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
principals—

(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property;

(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these
offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds
$3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
      (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
      determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability
      is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
      (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
      payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
      (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
      a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,
      this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
      (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
      under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further
      appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest
      the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax
      because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the
      taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
      (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
      compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
      (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
      U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]
(1) Listed end products.

|___________________            |___________________                  |


(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then
the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]
[  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in
the corresponding country as listed for that product.
[  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the
corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or
indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those
efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.

(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to
this solicitation is predominantly—
(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the
total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
(2) o Outside the United States.

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with
respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
[The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify
that—
    (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded

    (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or
    subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business
