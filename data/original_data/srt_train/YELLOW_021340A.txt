                                                SECTION B - SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS

B.1 This effort covers the information technology services cited in Section C to be procured under the terms and conditions of the contract.
This effort is for a base period of approximately one year for the installations, testing and implementation with four maintenance periods of
one year each.

B.2 TASK DEFINITIONS


B.2.1 Task A

Task A constitutes the acquisition of a complete and integrated Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software application for the processing of
transaction messages with other transaction-based systems including the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), International Justice and
Public Safety Network (NLETS), and the Interstate Identification Index (III).

The FBI intends to start with 2200 clients with the option to expand in the option years.

This task constitutes the requirement for enterprise licensing with unlimited users with expectations of locking in additional unit prices for
future needs.

This task should include option year cost estimates for client expansion in the following manner: 0-100; 101-200; 201-300; 301-400; and 401-500.


Base and option year cost estimates should be provided.

B.2.2 Task B

Task B constitutes enabling client capabilities on mobile devices such as Blackberries.  The FBI intends to start with 5000 mobile users with
the option to expand in the option years.

This task constitutes the requirement for enterprise licensing with unlimited users with expectations of locking in additional unit prices for
future needs.

This task should include option year cost estimates for expanding the mobile users in increments of 5000 not to exceed 25,000.

Base and option year cost estimates should be provided.

B.2.3 Task C

Task C constitutes integrating this application with the FBI’s Enterprise Identity Management System (EIMS) that provides Identification and
Authentication (I&A) and access management services.  Access to COTS product features is accomplished by granting user access to specific items
from a set of customizable attributes.  The government will implement a vendor-supplied list of fine-grained authorizations understood by the
COTS product for access to specific features.  EIMS permits the exchange of user security attributes via Security Assertion Markup Language
(SAML) assertions or HTTP header attributes.  The integrated COTS product must request and accept user attributes from EIMS and provide access
control based upon those attributes.

B.2.4 Task D

A five-year maintenance is required with the first year included.  This task should include base and option year cost estimates.

B.2.5 Task E.

Task E constitutes the customization and integration of the application within the FBI operational environment to support external interfaces.
This is only an option that the FBI may choose to exercise with each option year.

1  OVERVIEW

1.1  System Overview

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division located in Clarksburg, West Virginia (WV) is
responsible for providing internal access to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and International Justice and Public Safety
Information Sharing Network (NLETS) to internal components of the FBI.

The system is comprised of a centralized application and web servers that is located at the CJIS Data Center. These servers provide users the
ability to send and receive message transactions to NCIC, NLETS, Interstate Identification Index (III), and State databases.

1.2  Background

The FBI CJIS Division will be upgrading this internal system with the latest technologies for accessing NCIC, NLETS, and the III.  The upgraded
system shall provide access control, message switching, and other functions for the users of the internal system.

These internal FBI users currently utilize the CJIS Information Messaging Network (CIMN) for access to NCIC. The Government has examined the
operations of the current system and found areas of required improvement in its architecture and operations.  A replacement is being pursued for
the CIMN for issuance and processing of NCIC transactions. The replacement will operate similar to a message switch to provide access to NCIC
and NLETS.

The current messaging system utilizes a COTS application that processes both inbound and outbound transaction messages.  These messages follow
the transactions in accordance with the NCIC Operations Manual, NCIC Message Books, and the NLETS Message Book.  Modifications and application
enhancements have been required as a result of the Advisory Policy Board approvals or Congressional mandated direction to this system.

Each workstation utilized by the users of the system has a client application installed on a Microsoft Windows desktop operating system.  The
client handles the communications and process of message transactions between the workstation and the server.  For the web-based user, the user
is utilizing standard web browser to perform a limited set of message transactions.

The current workstation client's software receives and sends message transactions between the user and the server; provides preformatted message
transaction forms; prints message transaction; provide help functions; and logs user transactions.  The client's software permits the creation
of NCIC image records with a flatbed scanner or file import; allows the user to configure keyboard shortcuts to access commonly used message
transactions; and provides a drop down menu to retrieve a preformatted message form that is displayed on the screen.  Preformatted message
transaction forms reside on the server and contain all fields of the selected message transaction.  The forms highlight the mandatory fields
required for the message transaction and perform error checking to ensure all mandatory fields are complete and syntactically correct before
sending the message transaction.  The user also has the ability to override error checking in case of a field input or form error.

The FBI is currently using an internal system that provides mobile access to NCIC.  This system utilizes the browser on a Blackberry to access a
web site to produce a message transaction to NCIC, NLETS, and III.  The system configuration is limited in the functionality of the types of
message transactions that can be performed.

1.3 WAMS Overview

This contracted effort will be known as the WAMS contract.  The contract shall include the installation, integration, testing, training, and
maintenance of the product and services provided by the vendor.  Included in this effort shall be any required security testing and support
required for certification and accreditation prior to the introduction of any FBI sensitive information into the systems and facilities.  The
government will be responsible for the hardware, operating system, and database software as well as the cutover from the non-operational to the
operational environment.  The contractor shall support and participate in all testing efforts driven by the government.

Based upon experience with related products, the FBI is concerned with the security capabilities of the supplied products.  Therefore, the
product must be in full compliance with the FIPS 140-2 requirements, to include I&A.  In addition, the associated FIPS 140-2 certificates must
be provided with the proposal, along with supporting documentation to validate the product is configured in accordance with the FIPS 140-2
certificates.  Verification and validation of FIPS 140-2 compliancy must be demonstrated during the security testing utilizing the security test
cases to be provided by the government.

1.4 Objective

The FBI CJIS Division requests an integrated COTS application software product for the processing of transaction message and other transaction-
based systems including NCIC, NLETS, and the Interstate Identification Index.

The objective of this procurement effort is to procure a product that is an integrated COTS product for Microsoft Windows operating system that
will not require further development and/or coding.  The product will provide a turnkey solution for the government as identified by the
requirements.  The servers shall be Windows 2008 R2 with the latest service pack and patches.  The workstation shall be Windows XP with the
latest service pack and patches.  In addition, the product should be capable of supporting Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.5xx or latest
version.

The COTS product must satisfy functional, system, integration, policy, and business requirements as well as provide for future growth and
application enhancement.  Training, migration support, and ongoing maintenance will be required.  In addition, the COTS product will not require
any additional coding and/or development in order for it to be installed on the FBI CJIS system.  The product must be ready to be integrated
into the FBI platform immediately upon notice of award.

The FBI intends to purchase an enterprise license with unlimited users and lock in additional unit pricing for future needs.  A five-year
maintenance is required with the first year included in the cost.

The FBI intends to start with 2200 client and 5000 mobile users with the option to expand the clients in increments and expand the mobile users
in increments of 5000 not to exceed 25,000 in the option years.

Maintenance will be required for the option years.  The different levels of maintenance must be described in detail.

1.5 Contract Strategy

1.5.1 The WAMS contract (Base Period) will initially be comprised of installing the COTS product, training, migration support, and ongoing
maintenance.  It will also include purchasing and possibly enabling client capabilities on mobile devices such as Blackberries.  The
implementation of the client capabilities for the mobile devices could also be included in Option Year 1.

The contract type is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  Offerors shall include all costs for planning, testing, installation,
and certification and accreditation (C&A) efforts.

1.5.2 Option Period One through Four will include maintenance activities.  Option Period One and possibly Period Two will include integrating
this application with the FBI’s EIMS that provides I&A and access management services.  Option Period Two through Four may require the
customization and integration of the application within the FBI operational environment to support external interfaces (This is only an option
that the FBI may choose to exercise with each option year).

1.5.3 The Contractor shall, at a minimum, be responsible for all necessary labor, supplies, transportation, consumable materials, and facilities
to accomplish the tasks required by this SOW.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for all actions necessary to meet FBI security
requirements as stated in the FBI CJIS Division’s Controlled Access Protection Profile (CAPP).

background investigation to be conducted is determined by the level of access sought.

H.6.1.1 The following requirements shall be met by Contractor personnel working under this contract effort.

 • All Contractor personnel shall be citizens of the United States.

All cleared personnel accessing information within FBI-controlled space are required to execute a FBI Form DD 1001 Consent for Warrantless
Searches of Department of Justice (DOJ) Workplaces as a condition of working at FBI facilities.  The FBI Director implemented the Attorney
General’s policy subjecting employees to warrantless physical searches of their offices or immediate workplaces within DOJ premises when
authorized by the Attorney General (AG) or the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) based upon a determination that information the Department deems
credible indicates that the employee:

   1) is, or may be, disclosing classified information in an unauthorized manner;
   2) has incurred excessive indebtedness or has acquired a level of affluence that cannot be reasonably explained by other information;
   3) had the capability and opportunity to disclose classified information that is believed to have been lost or compromised to a foreign power
      or an agent of a foreign power; or
   4) has repeatedly or significantly mishandled or improperly stored classified information.

The search may extend to the entire office or workplace and anything within it that might hold classified information, including locked
containers (such as briefcases) and electronic storage media (such as computer disk and handheld computers), whether owned by the Government, by
the employee, or by a third party.  The search may be conducted by appropriate FBI personnel and/or law enforcement officers, on an announced or
unannounced basis, during the business day or after hours.  If discovered during a search, evidence of misconduct—whether related to storage or
classified information, storage of sensitive but unclassified information, or a crime—will be collected and reported to appropriate authorities.

Contractor personnel who will meet the above criteria will be required to sign Form FD 1001 Consent for Warrantless Searches of Department of
Justice Workplaces upon award and forward the executed form(s) to the assigned Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative designated in
Section G of the solicitation.  All forms will be retained by the FBI during the period the individual is providing services and two years after

interest to the FBI.  Requirements, as identified below, to include approval by the FBI's Security Division, must be satisfied prior to access.

Contractors who will require escorted access, to include short-term, intermittent, or infrequent access, to an FBI facility must complete an
"Access of Non-FBI Personnel to FBI Facilities, Background Data Information Form," (FD 816), a "Privacy Act of 1974 Acknowledgment Form" (FD
484) and two Fingerprint Cards (FD 258).  Completed forms should be provided to the assigned Contracting Officer's Technical Representative
(COTR) at least 10 days prior to required access.

Individuals requiring unescorted access to an FBI facility must complete the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security
Positions, using the Office of Personnel Management’s Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) and provide two
Fingerprint Cards (FD 258).  e-QIP is a secure website that can be accessed from any computer system which has an Internet connection.  Only the
signed release forms and FD 258 will need to be mailed to the identified Chief Security Officer, the SF-86 itself will be transmitted to the FBI
electronically.

To complete the SF-86 using e-QIP, the individual requiring unescorted access to the FBI facility must contact (insert Chief Security Officer,
Division, and telephone number) in order to be initiated into e-QIP.  Once this action has been accomplished, the individual should be able to
access e-QIP at the following link in order to initiate and complete the electronic process:  http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/browser-check.asp.
Thoroughly read and follow the instructions for completing the SF-86.  NOTE:  To fully address suitability/security issues, the FBI requires
individuals to provide responses to questions on the SF-86 for the last ten years.  Failure to complete the application as instructed may lead
to significant delays in processing the required investigation and approval for unescorted access.

Upon logging onto e-QIP, there will be a prompt to answer three “Golden” security questions to establish the user account.   After completing
the electronic SF-86, please print and sign the (1) Certification Form (CER) - Certify Completeness and Accuracy of your Investigation Request;
(2) Medical Release Form (MEL) - Authorization for Release of Medical Information; and (3) Release Form (REL) - Authorization for Release of
Information.  In addition to these SF 86 release forms, the completion of a Non-Personnel Consent to Release Information (FD-979a), the United
States Department of Justice Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports (DOJ 555) are required.  Annotation of the assigned e-
QIP Investigation Request Number on the upper right corner of each document transmitted to the identified Chief Security Officer is required for
coordination with the electronic transmission and to facilitate the investigative process.  The e-QIP Investigation Request Number,
automatically generated by e-QIP, is located on both the header and footer of the signature forms.  These release forms (five total) and FD 258
should be mailed via Federal Express or UPS Express mail directly to the following address:  (insert name and address of Chief Security
Officer).  The use of regular U.S. mail channels may cause significant delays in processing the unescorted access request.

Upon completion of processing the facility access request, the individual will be required to execute a non-disclosure agreement suitable for
their approved access.

                                                           SECTION I – CONTRACT CLAUSES


I.1 NOTIFICATION OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS CONCERNING PAYMENT OF UNION DUES OR FEES (Dec 2004) [FAR 52.222-39]


   (a) Definition. As used in this clause—
   “United States” means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S.
Virgin Islands, and Wake Island.


   (b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, during the term of this contract, the Contractor shall post a notice, in the form of a
poster, informing employees of their rights concerning union membership and payment of union dues and fees, in conspicuous places in and about
all its plants and offices, including all places where notices to employees are customarily posted. The notice shall include the following
information (except that the information pertaining to National Labor Relations Board shall not be included in notices posted in the plants or
offices of carriers subject to the Railway Labor Act, as amended [45 U.S.C. 151-188]).


                                                               Notice to Employees

   Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs.  Under
   certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security agreement requiring employees to pay uniform
   periodic dues and initiation fees.  However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes
   and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance
   adjustment.


   If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract
   administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been
   required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance
   adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments.


   For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its
   Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number:


                       National Labor Relations Board
                       Division of Information
                       1099 14th Street, N.W.
                       Washington, DC 20570
                       1-866-667-6572
                       1-866-316-6572 (TTY)


   To locate the nearest NLRB office, see NLRB’s website at http://www.nlrb.gov.


   (c) The Contractor shall comply with all provisions of Executive Order 13201 of February 17, 2001, and related implementing regulations at 29
CFR Part 470, and orders of the Secretary of Labor.


   (d) In the event that the Contractor does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), or (g), the Secretary may
direct that this contract be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and declare the Contractor ineligible for further
government contracts in accordance with procedures at 29 CFR Part 470, Subpart B—Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations and
Enforcement Procedures. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided by 29 CFR Part 470, which implements Executive Order
13201, or as are otherwise provided by law.


   (e) The requirement to post the employee notice in paragraph (b) does not apply to—


      (1) Contractors and subcontractors that employ fewer than 15 persons;


      (2) Contractor establishments or construction work sites where no union has been formally recognized by the Contractor or certified as the
exclusive bargaining representative of the Contractor’s employees;


      (3) Contractor establishments or construction work sites located in a jurisdiction named in the definition of the United States in which
the law of that jurisdiction forbids enforcement of union-security agreements;


      (4) Contractor facilities where upon the written request of the Contractor, the Department of Labor Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-
Management Programs has waived the posting requirements with respect to any of the Contractor’s facilities if the Deputy Assistant Secretary
finds that the Contractor has demonstrated that—


        (i) The facility is in all respects separate and distinct from activities of the Contractor related to the performance of a contract;
and


        (ii) Such a waiver will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of the Executive order; or


      (5) Work outside the United States that does not involve the recruitment or employment of workers within the United States.


   (f) The Department of Labor publishes the official employee notice in two variations; one for contractors covered by the Railway Labor Act and
a second for all other contractors.  The Contractor shall—


      (1) Obtain the required employee notice poster from the Division of Interpretations and Standards, Office of Labor-Management Standards,
U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-5605, Washington, DC 20210, or from any field office of the Department’s Office of
Labor-Management Standards or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs;


      (2) Download a copy of the poster from the Office of Labor-Management Standards website at http://www.olms.dol.gov; or


      (3) Reproduce and use exact duplicate copies of the Department of Labor’s official poster.


   (g) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order that exceeds the simplified acquisition
threshold, entered into in connection with this contract, unless exempted by the Department of Labor Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-
Management Programs on account of special circumstances in the national interest under authority of 29 CFR 470.3(c).  For indefinite quantity
subcontracts, the Contractor shall include the substance of this clause if the value of orders in any calendar year of the subcontract is
expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Pursuant to 29 CFR Part 470, Subpart B—Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations
and Enforcement Procedures, the Secretary of Labor may direct the Contractor to take such action in the enforcement of these regulations,
including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance with respect to any such subcontract or purchase order.  If the Contractor becomes
involved in litigation with a subcontractor or vendor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the Contractor may
request the United States, through the Secretary of Labor, to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.

I.2 STATEMENT OF EQUIVALENT RATES FOR FEDERAL HIRES (May 1989) [FAR 52.222-42]

I.3 UNSAFE CONDITIONS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (June 1996) [JAR 2852.223-70]

   (a) "Unsafe condition" as used in this clause means the actual or potential exposure of contractor or government employees to a hazardous
material as defined in Federal Standard No. 313, and any revisions thereto during the term of this contract, or any other material or working
condition designated by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) as potentially hazardous and requiring safety controls.


   (b) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors
to apprise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for
safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.


   (c) Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of,
or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will
be working.


   (d) If during the performance of the work under this contract, the contractor or any of its employees, or subcontractor employees, discovers
the existence of an unsafe condition, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer, or designee, (with written notice
provided not later than three (3) business days thereafter) of the existence of an unsafe condition. Such notice shall include the contractor’s
recommendations for the protection and the safety of government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the
unsafe condition.


   (e) When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate
the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute
under the Disputes clause of this contract.


   (f) Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local
laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but
not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.

                                                 Organizational Conflict of Interest Plan (OCIP)





















                                                        This page is intentionally blank.

                                                 Organizational Conflict of Interest Plans (OCIP)

Every Contractor or subcontractor who submits an offer as a Prime Contractor or as a member of a contractor teaming arrangement shall review and
comply with FAR Subpart 9.5.

Since ensuring trust is of paramount importance, only companies with acceptable Organizational Conflict of Interest Plans (for themselves and
proposed subcontractors) will be eligible for award.

Each Organizational Conflict of Interest Plan shall follow the requirements set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5.  Each of the items listed below shall
be specifically addressed using the corresponding unique numeric designation listed below.

       1. Organization charts showing the company’s corporate structure and highlighting elements of the company participating in the contract.
       2. Demonstrate how the elements performing the proposed effort will be isolated from the remainder of the company for the purposes of
          controlling FBI information.
       3. Address how your company will control the reassignment/transfer of designated key personnel.
       4. Describe the process for reassigning personnel, including subcontractors, from one assignment to another, including restrictions
          governing reassignments.
       5. Describe how information, whether in hard copy or electronic media, will be stored and destroyed in order to preclude an unauthorized
          transfer of information.
       6. Describe how networks and servers will be protected to prevent unauthorized transfer of information.
       7. Describe management reporting chains in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the proposed effort and decisions related to the effort
          will be isolated from the remainder of the company for the purposes of controlling FBI information.
       8. Provide information to indicate if the organizational elements performing the proposed effort will be geographically or physically
          separated from the remainder of the company.
       9. Describe techniques your company will employ to mitigate the perception that you will favor your own products or services.
      10. Describe the process in which the Government will have insight or oversight of key processes.
      11. Describe any situation in which management outside the mitigated organization will have access to key decisions for which the mitigated
          organization is responsible.
      12. Provide all documents that your employees are required to sign indicating OCI awareness, indicate which employees are required to sign
          the documents, and list how often the employees are required to re-sign the documents.
      13. Describe the process for employees that leave your employment and any control you exercise over their future employment, particularly
          as it relates to OCI and non-disclosure.
      14. Describe any OCI training your employees are offered and/or mandated to attend along with the timing (before or after starting work on
          a government contract), frequency, length, and content of such training.
      15. Describe if your company conducts OCI self-audits and if they will be made available to the Government.
      16. Describe the proposed process and timelines for submitting and obtaining the approval by the FBI Contracting Officer of the OCI
          Mitigation Plans for any and all subcontractors added to the contract post-award that were not included in the OCI Mitigation Plans
          submitted as part of the Contractor’s proposal.

To enable the FBI to evaluate the proposed plan, the following shall be specifically addressed:

     A. Disclosure of business activities of your company, your affiliates, your team members and affiliates of your team members which create
        either a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest.
     B. Provide evidence of facts and circumstances that you believe mitigate or address concerns related to the appearance and/or presence of an
        OCI.
     C. Explain your proposed approach to mitigating the effects of any apparent or actual conflicts of interest arising out of the business
        activities disclosed in response to Item “A” above.  The Government will treat all submissions as proprietary under 18 U.S.C. §1905 and
        protect proposal information accordingly.

























                                                                  ATTACHMENT J-6

                                               Security, Access, and Clearance Requirements (SACR)





















                                                        This page is intentionally blank.
                                               Security, Access, and Clearance Requirements (SACR)

Upon the award of a contract and continuing as needed, appropriate Contractor, subcontractor, and vendor individuals will be processed as
directed by FBI policies and procedures.

1.0   Personnel Security

      1.1   Purpose

      The protection of government information is directly related to the effectiveness of the Personnel Security Program.  An interlocking and
mutually supported series of program elements (i.e., need-to-know, investigation, binding contractual obligations on those granted access,
security education and awareness, and individual responsibility) provide reasonable assurances against compromise of national security
information by those authorized access to it.

      1.2   Policy

      No person will be granted access to FBI facilities and/or information without a valid need-to-know and approved access as granted by the
FBI's Security Program Manager.

      Performance under this contract will require access to FBI locations to provide some service or product, or perform some other official
function of interest to the FBI.  Requirements, as identified below, to include approval by the FBI's Security Division, shall be satisfied
prior to access.

      Contractors who will require escorted access, to include short-term, intermittent, or infrequent access, to an FBI facility shall complete
an "Access of Non-FBI Personnel to FBI Facilities, Background Data Information Form," (FD 816), a "Privacy Act Notice for Maintenance Employees"
(FD 484) and two “Applicant Fingerprint Cards” (FD 258).  Completed forms shall be provided to the assigned Contracting Officer's Technical
Representative (COTR) at least 10 business days prior to required access.

      Individuals requiring unescorted access to an FBI facility shall complete the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), “Questionnaire for National
Security Positions,” “Non-Personnel Consent to Release Information” (FD-979a), the United States Department of Justice “Disclosure and
Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act” (DOJ 555), and provide two “Applicant Fingerprint Cards”
(FD 258).  Completed forms shall be provided to the COTR at least 60 calendar days prior to required access.

      NOTE:  To fully address suitability/security issues, the FBI requires individuals to provide responses to questions on the SF-86 for the
last 10 years.  Failure to complete the application as instructed may lead to significant delays in processing the required investigation and
approval for unescorted access.

      Upon completion of processing the facility access request, the individual will be required to execute a non-disclosure agreement suitable
for their approved access.

            The Contractor security personnel and/or management shall notify the FBI COTR's office as soon as they become aware of a termination
          or pending termination to allow the FBI to take the appropriate measures and ending access.  If this becomes evident outside of normal
          business hours, the Contractor shall have contact information (pager/cell phone numbers) to notify the COTR.  FBI property shall be
          obtained at the time of termination as well as the “Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement” form (SF-312) signed in the
          debriefing area.  These items shall be submitted immediately to the COTR's office along with a letter regarding the termination.
          Termination letters shall contain the employees’ full name, SSN, effective date, and general reason for termination.  If it is known
          that the Contractor is leaving to join another FBI program, it shall also be noted in the letter to allow the new FBI COTR to assume
          responsibility for the individual.

      1.3   Requirements for Clearance and/or Access

      An individual’s clearance and access can be granted after favorable accomplishment of each of the following:

         • Access approval as granted by the FBI’s Security Program Manager.
         • Personnel Security Interview (PSI) and polygraph examination, if applicable.
         • Signing of SF-312, “Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement” (NdA) or other applicable non-disclosure agreement, as required.
         • Signing a Consent for Warrantless Searches of Department of Justice Workplaces, if applicable.
         • Completion of security indoctrination of the individual.

      1.4   Need-to-Know

      The primary security principle in safeguarding classified and sensitive information is to ensure it is accessible only by those persons
with an appropriate clearance, access approval, clearly identified need-to-know, and an appropriate indoctrination.  The holder of the
information is expected to practice need-to-know discipline in disseminating or disclosing information about the program or project involved.
Intrinsic to this discipline is acquiring or disseminating only that information essential to effectively carrying out the assignment.  No
person will be deemed to have a need-to-know solely by virtue of rank, title, or position.

      1.5   Contractors

      Contractors shall meet all personnel security standards established for the information and/or facility access they require to accomplish
the terms of the contract.

2.0   Contracts Involving Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) and Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) Information

      Should an acquisition require access to SBU or LES information, security requirements must be incorporated into the contract.  The
relevant COTR, in conjunction with the FBI CJIS Division’s Chief Security Officer (CSO), is responsible for ensuring the establishment and
implementation of requirements at both FBI and Contractor locations.  At a minimum:

        a. Access to FBI locations will be subject to specific security requirements, which shall be satisfied prior to access.
        b. All Contractor personnel shall complete the security processes and meet the requirements specified by the FBI Security Division.  At
           a minimum, Contractor personnel will undergo a Limited Background Investigation (LBI).  An LBI consists of FBIHQ and/or field
           offices’ indices checks, the FBI CJIS Division’s checks, National Crime Information Center (NCIC) wanted files, criminal history
           records through the NCIC Interstate Identification Index (III), local and police agency checks, and where applicable, verification of
           citizenship or alien status.  An LBI is initiated for all contract individuals that require access to FBI information or an FBI
           facility but do not require a clearance or unescorted access (e.g., construction workers, furniture installers, and periodic official
           visitors).
        c. Information pertaining to FBI programs shall be made available only on a need-to-know basis and shall not be further disseminated
           without prior written consent of the FBI Contracting Officer.  No information or government-furnished equipment shall leave either
           FBI or Contractor space unless approved by the FBI Contracting Officer.
        d. No information may be transmitted via the Internet or any other network that would allow individuals not associated with the contract
           to directly or indirectly access it.
        e. During work hours, if work areas are accessible to persons who do not have a need-to-know, information shall be placed in out-of-
           sight locations.  During non-work hours, information shall be stored to preclude unauthorized access.  When internal building
           security is provided, filing materials in unlocked files or desks is adequate.  In the absence of internal building security,
           buildings or rooms shall be locked or materials shall be stored in locked containers.
        f. Information shall be shipped via U.S. mail, courier, encrypted electronic mail or secure facsimile.
        g. When no longer needed, information shall be disposed of by a method approved for classified information.
        h. If an information system is required to process SBU or LES information:
        (i)      The Contractor shall designate, in writing, an individual to act as the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) responsible
        for systems and networks.
        (ii)     The Contractor is responsible for the security of all information systems used by the Contractor, whether or not they connect
        to FBI networks, and are operated by the Contractor for the FBI, regardless of location.  The following constitutes the minimum set of
        technical security standards that shall be applied to all information systems processing FBI information:
                  o User Identification - Each system user will have a unique user identification.
                  o Authentication - Each system user will be required to authenticate his/her user ID with a complex password.
                  o Auditing - Each system will be configured to perform auditing of system access.  The following minimum information will be
                    captured in an audit record: Identity of each user; time and date of each access; and activities performed that might bypass,
                    modify, or negate security controls.
                  o Security-relevant actions associated with processing.
                  o Object Reuse - Each system will clear memory and storage before reallocating space to a different user.
                  o Warning Banner - A standard FBI warning banner will be presented to each user logging into any system processing FBI
                    information.
                  o Inactivity Timeout - An automated data processing (ADP) system will automatically revert to a security condition if left
                    inactive for a period of 15 minutes (or less), requiring the logged-on user to unlock the screen using a password.
        (c)      The Contractor shall prepare and submit a System Security Plan (SSP) for review in accordance with the Certification and
        Accreditation (C&A) Handbook.
        (d)      All Contractor personnel with access to FBI information systems, networks or data shall complete a computer system access
        request, unclassified Automated Information Systems (AIS) access briefing and acknowledgment, sensitive data nondisclosure agreement,
        and accept the requirements of the FBI rules of behavior before being granted access to FBI systems, and annually thereafter.
        (e)      Buildings or individual offices where SBU is processed shall have entrance doors that lock and that will show evidence of
        unauthorized entry.
        i. The Contractor shall not use or redistribute any FBI information processed, stored, or transmitted by the Contractor, except as
           specified in the contract.
        j. Contractor supervisors shall ensure a sufficient separation of duties to prevent a single individual from committing fraud with or
           abusing FBI systems or data.
        k. Contractor personnel shall have access only to that information required for their tasks.  Contractors shall therefore request and
           enforce those facility, information, and information system accesses that are essential for each individual’s job performance.
        l. At the FBI’s discretion, Contractor personnel may be required to undergo counterintelligence-focused polygraph examinations.  Such
           examinations may be prior to or during contract activities and may be without prior notification.

3.0   Required Forms

      The FBI will maintain a listing of contract employees who have been authorized access/clearance.  The Contractor shall provide personnel
from this list to perform the requested services.

      Upon a contract award, the Contractor, subcontractor(s), key personnel, and any other non-FBI personnel designated by the FBI, who require
access to FBI information, property, or facilities, shall, based upon the length and nature of their assignment, provide the COTR the following
properly executed forms.  Forms associated with security clearances shall be submitted 60 calendar days prior to beginning the stated contract
tasks.  Incomplete or improperly executed forms will not be considered responsive to this requirement and will be returned to the Contractor.
Forms associated with LBIs shall be submitted 21 calendar days prior to needed access to FBI information.  The Contractor shall not allow access
to FBI information until notified of the successful completion of the LBI.

      a. One-day, one-time escorted access with no system access, or escorted access of one to five (1-5) consecutive days only with no
      returning site visits and requiring no system access:

           (ii)  FD-484 "Privacy Act Notice for Maintenance Employees"

      If possible, this paperwork should be provided to the FBI CJIS Division’s Security Access Office 72 hours prior to the site visit.

      b. Escorted access requiring no system access of five (5) or more consecutive days, or recurring visits, or access to FBI information
      requiring no access to FBI facilities (LBI forms):

           (i)   FD-816 "Access of Non-FBI Personnel to FBI Facilities, Background Data Information Form"
           (ii)  FD-484 " Privacy Act Notice for Maintenance Employees "
           (iii) Two (2) FD-258 "Applicant Fingerprint Cards" (if fingerprinted at the FBI CJIS Division West Virginia Facility only one (1) FD-
                 258 is necessary)

      c. More than ninety (90) days FBI facility access, unescorted access and/or system access:

           (i)   The FBI CJIS Division’s Security Access Office Interoffice Memorandum "Cover Sheet/Preliminary Check for Access" or FD-316
                 "Background data for Limited …."
           (ii)  Two (2) FD-258 "Applicant Fingerprint Cards" (if fingerprinted at the FBI CJIS Division West Virginia Facility only one (1) FD-
                 258 is necessary)
           (iii) SF-86 "Questionnaire for National Security Positions" (Note:  An FD-484 is not used in conjunction with an SF-86)
           (iv)  DOJ Form 555 “Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act”
           (v)   FBI Form FD-979 “Personnel Consent to Release Information”

      d. Additionally, non-FBI personnel must be indoctrinated, as required, prior to being granted access to any FBI project and/or any FBI IT

L.7 Instructions to Offerors for acquisitions involving procurement of goods and services of Critical Assets (ADP hardware and software,
telecommunications, and audiovisual equipment)

Every effort must be made to ensure that supplies are provided and integrated and services are performed using sound security components,
practices, and procedures.  Acquisition of supplies or services from concerns under Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) or of
supplies developed, manufactured, maintained, or modified by concerns under FOCI (any or all of which shall be referred to herein as "Use of
FOCI source") is of serious concern and must be approved prior to contract award.  Approval decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after
the source or technology has been identified by the Offeror and subjected to a risk assessment.

The risk assessment process will vary depending on the acquisition type and proposed use of a FOCI source, available risk mitigation measures,
and the information/justification provided by the Offeror.

Any Offeror responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Sealed Bid acknowledges the government’s requirements
to secure services or equipment from firms which are not under FOCI, or where any FOCI, in the opinion of the Government, adversely impacts on
National Security or security requirements.  The Offeror understands and agrees that the Government retains the right to reject any response to
this RFP, RFQ, or Sealed Bid made by the Offeror, without any further recourse by or explanation to the Offeror, if the FOCI for that Offeror is
determined by the Government to be an unacceptable security risk.

Risk assessments will be on a case-by-case basis and will be used to determine whether the use of a FOCI source poses an unacceptable security
risk.  If an unacceptable security risk is determined, the Government retains the right to reject the use of a FOCI source or to require that
certain risk mitigation measures be taken by the Offeror.  Similarly, the Government retains the unilateral right to approve the use of a FOCI
source when the risk assessment indicates that such use would be in the government’s best interests.  If the use of a FOCI source is not
approved, no classified information will be disclosed to the Offeror as part of the government’s rationale for non approval.  The Offeror (prime
and subs) may not seek reimbursement from the Government for any costs associated with responding to this RFP, RFQ or Sealed Bid, as a result of
a FOCI non-approval decision.

Offerors shall provide answers to the Acquisition Risk Questions and provide the completed Key Management Personnel Listing (KMPL) for the Prime
Contractor and all proposed subcontractors.  Provision of false information shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this
contract.

The Government reserves the right to prohibit individuals who are not U.S. citizens from all or certain aspects of the work to be performed
under this Contract.

Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI):  For purposes of this clause, a U.S. company is considered under FOCI whenever a foreign
interest has the power, direct or indirect, and whether or not exercisable through the ownership of the U.S. company’s securities, by
contractual arrangements or other means, to direct or decide matters affecting the management or operations of that company.

Changed conditions, such as change in ownership, indebtedness, or the foreign intelligence threat, may justify certain adjustments to the
security terms under which a company is operating, or, alternatively, that different FOCI mitigation measures be employed.  If a changed
condition is of sufficient significance, it might also result in a determination that a company is no longer considered to be under FOCI.  There
is a continuing obligation of the Selected Offeror to advise the Government of such changed conditions.  Failure to abide by this obligation
shall be cause for default under the Default Clause of this contract.

Factors:  The following factors will be used as the basis for making an acquisition risk determination.  If the Offeror, or its proposed
subcontractors, meet any of the following factors, they must identify themselves as a potential FOCI company and submit themselves for a
government FOCI evaluation and risk assessment:

(1)  Ownership or beneficial ownership, direct or indirect, of 5 percent or more of the Offeror’s company’s voting securities by a foreign
person.
(2)  Ownership or beneficial ownership, direct or indirect, of 25 percent or more of any class of the Offeror’s company’s non-voting securities
by a foreign person.
(3)  Management positions, such as directors, officers, or executive personnel of the Offeror’s company held by non-U.S. citizens.
(4)  Foreign person power, direct or indirect, to control the election, appointment, or tenure of directors, officers or executive personnel of
the Offeror’s company or other decisions or activities of the Offeror’s company.
(5)  Contracts, agreements, understandings, or arrangements between the Offeror’s company and a foreign person.
(6)  Loan arrangements between the Offeror’s company and a foreign person if the Offeror’s company’s (the borrower) overall debt to equity ratio
is 40:60 or greater; or financial obligations that are subject to the ability of a foreign person to demand repayment.
(7)  Annual total revenues or net income in excess of 5 percent from a single foreign person or in excess of 30 percent from foreign persons in
the aggregate.
(8)  Ten percent or more of any class of the Offeror’s voting securities held in “nominee shares,” in “street names,” or in some other method
that does not disclose the beneficial ownership of equitable title.
(9)  Interlocking directors with foreign persons and any officer or management official of the Offeror’s company who is also employed by a
foreign person.
(10)  Any other factor that indicates or demonstrates a capability on the part of foreign persons to control or influence the operations or
management of the Offeror’s company.
(11)  Ownership of 10 percent or more of any foreign interest.

benefit to the Government may, however, result in rejection of the proposal(s) as unacceptable.  Requests for exceptions, assumptions, or
deviations and their justifications will not be counted in the page number limitations specified.

supporting information.  Multiple contracts and/or efforts can be included to enhance credibility.
         • Unambiguous identification of the contract or project by name.
         • The actual hours.
         • The adjustment factor(s) applied to the actual hours, including magnitude-related, scope-related, and difficulty-related factors,  as
           appropriate.
         • The resulting proposed hours.

           adjustment factor(s) used.
For development effort, the Offeror shall identify quantity of new work, major or minor modifications, and existing items such as drawings, test
equipment, etc., that are usable for this effort, referenced to the end item level of the CLIN.

                                                     SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD



M.1 Evaluation

M.1.1  The Government intends to award a single contract, but reserves the right to award multiple contracts, resulting from this solicitation
to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will provide the best overall value to satisfy the government’s
needs.  The selection of the proposal providing the best overall value shall be in accordance with Paragraph M.3.

M.1.2 The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by using the total cost of all Contract Line Items (CLINs) in Section B.  The
Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the proposed costs are unsupported by the provided basis of estimate.  Evaluation of
Option-Period CLINs will not obligate the Government to use that CLIN for additional services.

M.1.3 A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for
acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified
expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer) with or without discussions or with or without negotiations unless a
written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  The Government specifically reserves the right to accept an offer based solely on the
Offeror’s proposal.  The Government specifically reserves the right to remove from award consideration any Offeror’s proposal that does not
conform to all requirements of the Solicitation.  Alternate proposals will neither be entertained nor evaluated.

M.2 Pre-Award Survey

The Government may conduct a complete or partial pre-award survey of Offerors.  The survey may include individual interviews and review of
documentation of the Offeror’s systems engineering and software processes, plans, and practices; and how they are being applied to current
Offeror efforts.  The following factors may be investigated during the survey and any findings will be considered in the evaluation process:

      • Technical capability
      • Financial capability
      • Purchasing and subcontracting
      • Quality assurance capability
      • Performance record
      • Ability to meet required schedule
      • Ability to provide the required system(s) support


      • Technical and functional processes maturity
      • Security clearance

All applicable requirements of FAR Part 30 shall be met prior to award.

M.3 Basis of Award

M.3.1 The following conditions must be met in order to be eligible for award:

M.3.1.1 The proposal must comply in all material respects with the requirements of law, regulation, and conditions set forth in the
Solicitation.

M.3.1.2 The Offeror must be determined responsible according to the standards in FAR Subpart 9.1.

M.3.1.3 Upon satisfying the requirements of Paragraphs M.3.1.1 and M.3.1.2, the Source Selection Authority (SSA) will determine the proposal
that provides the best overall value to satisfy the government’s need.  This selection will be based on how well each proposal satisfies the
evaluation criteria as described in Paragraph M.4.

M.3.2 Other Evaluation Information

In conducting evaluation of proposals, the Government reserves the right to use all information available at the time of evaluations.  The
Government may rely on information contained in its own records (such as government audit reports, Organizational Conflict of Interest reports),
commercial sources (such as Dun and Bradstreet Reports), and information publicly available (such as information available on the Internet).
Additionally, the Government may contact Offeror references or other individuals or organizations to develop past performance evaluation

The Offeror’s Cost proposal shall represent the Offeror’s response to the requirements of the Solicitation.  Cost realism, or lack thereof, will
enter into the government’s assessment of the measure of understanding of the requirements possessed by each Offeror, meaning the degree of the
government’s confidence in the Offeror’s ability to perform at or within its estimate of costs.

The Offeror’s Cost proposal shall represent the Offeror’s response to the requirements of the Solicitation.  Cost realism, or lack thereof, will
enter into the government’s assessment of the measure of understanding of the requirements possessed by each Offeror, meaning the degree of the
government’s confidence in the Offeror’s ability to perform at or within its estimate of costs.

The Government will develop, for evaluation purposes, a government estimate of the contract’s most probable cost (GEMPC) taking into account the
Contractor’s proposed costs and the government’s evaluation of those costs.  This will be vetted through the FBI CO and the OGC.  The GEMPC will
include adjustments to the proposed cost for additional cost to the Government for use of government facilities and government-furnished
equipment (GFE) requirements.  At the government’s discretion, the Government may adjust the proposed cost to account for government assessed
cost risk, use of government facilities, and the cost of supplying government-furnished equipment, resulting in an expected base period and
option periods contract cost that will be used for evaluation purposes.

Completeness:  The Cost Proposal will be evaluated for completeness by assessing the responsiveness of the Offeror in providing cost data for
all solicitation requirements and by assessing the traceability of estimates with the proposed technical solution.  Overall cost reasonableness
will be assessed through cost analysis techniques as defined by FAR 15.404-1.

For the cost data to be complete, the Offeror must provide all the data that is necessary to support the offer.  The amount of data needed may
vary depending on the requirements.  If the service offered is “off-the-shelf,” the Offeror may only need to supply information about the
catalog price or the price at which the item or service has been sold in the recent past.  However, for developmental items, the Offeror may
need to provide information on the cost of raw materials, labor, scrap rates, and so on.  To reduce the burden on the Government and the
Offeror, the amount of detail needed in this area should be carefully tailored to the requirements.

Reasonableness:  The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of proposed costs by assessing the acceptability of the Offeror’s methodology
used in developing the cost estimates.  For the cost to be reasonable, in its nature and amount, it should not exceed that which would be
incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business.  It represents a compromise between the seller’s and the buyer’s opinions
of what constitutes a fair price.  Reasonableness will take into account the context of the source selection, including current market
conditions and other factors that affect the ability of an Offeror to perform the contract requirements.  Reasonableness will depend upon a
variety of considerations and circumstances, including:

    • Whether it is the type of cost generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the Offeror’s business or contract
      performance,
    • Generally accepted sound business practices and Federal and state laws and regulations,  and
    • Any significant deviations from the Offeror’s established practices.

Realism:  The Government will evaluate the realism of proposed costs by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and
effort.  For the cost to be realistic, it must reflect what it would cost the Offeror to perform the effort, if the Offeror operates with
reasonable economy and efficiency.  The cost realism evaluation also relies on internal-to-the-government cost estimates and identified
technical, management, and past performance risks present in the proposal.  The result of the realism analysis is the GEMPC that will be used in
the government’s best value analysis.

The cost realism evaluation includes a review of the overall costs in an Offeror’s proposal to determine if they:

    • Are realistic for the work to be performed;
    • Reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and
    • Are consistent with the various elements of the Offeror’s technical proposal.  As an example, if the Offeror’s technical proposal
      identifies 100 staff-years of effort, then the proposed cost basis of estimate should also reflect 100 staff-years of cost.

FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990), applies and is incorporated by reference.
