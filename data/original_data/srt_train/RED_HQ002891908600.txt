High-Stakes Summit

BRIAN WILLIAMS:  We’ve come a good long way since the Cold War, but relations with the Russians have been downright chilly for a good number of
years.

Tonight, the president of the United States is in Russia and when those two leaders talked, the whole world has a stake in it.  As Time magazine
put it this week, between them let’s not forget they own enough firepower to blow us all to kingdom come.  They talked about that firepower
today as a new U.S. president now gets to deal with the Russians.

It’s where we begin tonight.  Our chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd traveling with the president in Moscow.  Chuck, good evening.

CHUCK TODD:  Good evening, Brian.

Well, it was a very busy first day in Moscow for President Obama because in the words of the Russian president, the two were dealing with a
backlog of problems.  Those problems include that nuclear proliferation issue you were talking about, Iran, even U.S. beef exports.

Flying all night, the president arrived in Moscow early Monday with his entire family in tow.  Unlike his previous overseas trips, the pomp and
circumstance was kept to a minimum by his host, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev – a subtle reminder the two Cold War adversaries were in
danger of falling back into old habits.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  (From tape.)  The president and I agreed that the relationship between Russia and the United States has suffered from a
sense of drift.  We resolved to reset U.S.-Russian relations so that we can cooperate more effectively in areas of common interests.

TODD:  The areas of common interests: nuclear arms reduction and the war in Afghanistan.  The major achievement of the day: a framework for a
new nuclear arms treaty to be hammered out by year’s end.  It includes a reduction of nuclear warheads from the current limit of 2,200 to a new
lower range between 1,500 and 1,675, and eliminating as many as one-third of the two countries’ long-range missiles capable of carrying those
warheads from 1,600 to between 500 and 1,100.

As for Afghanistan, the U.S. military can now use Russian airspace to move supplies and troops in and out of the country.  But those were the
easy topics.

OBAMA:  (From tape.)  As President Medvedev indicated, we’ve had some frank discussions and there are areas where we still disagree.

TODD:  Most notably, an American plan for expanding missile defense near the Russian border.

OBAMA:  (From tape.)  President Medvedev has been very clear that this is a point of deep concern and sensitivity to the Russian government.

DMITRY MEDVEDEV [Russian President]:  (From tape, translated.)  Our understanding is that these decisions do concern us and we will have to come
to terms on these positions.

TODD:  The Russian president took pains not to mention Iran by name today – simply referring to nuclear issues in the Middle East.  But as Mr.
Obama’s top Russia advisor put it, the U.S. is receiving indications the Russians want to cooperate on Iran.

MICHAEL MCFAUL [White House Russia Advisor]:  (From tape.)  If they wanted to have an adversarial relationship with us with Iran right now,
there’re all kinds of things they could do very easily that would make our situation a lot worse there – and they’re not doing those things.

TODD:  Another reason for U.S. optimism – the personal chemistry between the two leaders.  Harkening back to the trust but verify days of the
Cold War, a wary Mr. Obama said he trusted Medvedev to a point.

OBAMA:  (From tape.)  President Medvedev and I are committed to leaving behind the suspicion and the rivalry of the past so that we can advance
the interests that we hold in common.

TODD:  Now, Brian, tomorrow, the president meets with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.  Now, today, the president was quite nimble in trying to
deal with the question of whether Medvedev or Putin really holds the power here.  He said, quote, “My strong impression is that President
Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin are working very effectively together.”

I think he’ll get a firsthand look about Putin tomorrow.  Brian?

WILLIAMS:  All right.  Chuck Todd at the meeting of these two leaders in Moscow tonight, thanks.

War In Afghanistan

WILLIAMS:  This was a deadly day for U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  Seven deaths in all, including four killed in a roadside bomb attack on U.S.
military trainers in the northern part of Afghanistan; two killed in another attack in the south; one more who died after a firefight in the
eastern region of the country.  It was the worst one-day toll in almost a year of fighting.

Deadly Clashes

WILLIAMS:  And it was a violent day in China where authorities continue a brutal crackdown on ethnic unrest that has exploded into rioting and
bloodshed, as you’ll see, over the past two days.  China’s own news agency says more than 150 people are dead; hundreds more injured.

Our own Ian Williams is in China where he filed this report.

IAN WILLIAMS:  The deadly clashes were shown on state television: Muslim minority Uyghurs rioting and battling with Chinese security forces.  It
was the worst unrest to hit Xinjiang Province in decades as ethnic tensions erupted.  The violence left at least 156 dead and hundreds injured,
according to officials who blamed Muslim separatists.

Urumqi’s main hospitals struggled to treat the wounded, who claimed they were targeted because they were Han Chinese.  But exiled groups blamed
a police crackdown against the peaceful protest by Uyghurs.

ALIM SEYTOFF [World Uyghur Congress Spokesman]:  (From tape.)  Many of the Uyghurs were holding Chinese national flags to prove that they were
nonviolent, but still the Chinese government – what we believe has committed massacre against us, peaceful Uyghur people.

WILLIAMS:  Tension is never far from the surface in Xinjiang as NBC News discovered during a visit last year.  We found mosques under close
surveillance and widespread resentment among Uyghurs, who mostly work on the margins of an economy dominated by Chinese migrants and a vital
source of China’s energy supplies.

There were several bomb blasts here ahead of the Olympics.  China labels Uyghur separatists as terrorists.  There is now a heavy police and army
presence in Urumqi, a city of more than two million people.  A crackdown is underway.  The authorities say they’ve rounded up hundreds of
rioters.  Internet and mobile phone services have been cut.

Tonight, the authorities claim to have the situation in Urumqi under control, but there are reports of clashes in another city and of rising
tension right across that region.

Ian Williams, NBC News, Beijing.

Robert McNamara, 1916-2009

WILLIAMS:   Word arrived this morning that Robert McNamara has died.  It is difficult to this day to find someone who came up during the 1960s
who doesn’t have an opinion about him.  McNamara died knowing a lot of that was negative despite attempts to salvage his reputation.  His name
will always be associated with one place – Vietnam.

ROBERT S. MCNAMARA [Former Secretary of Defense]:  (From tape.)  Human beings make many, many mistakes in war.

WILLIAMS:  John F. Kennedy called him the smartest man he ever met.  LBJ said he was brilliant.  Robert Strange McNamara was one of the so-
called whiz kids, the intellectuals of the World War II era.  A product of Harvard Business School, he was an accounting professor.  He ran the
Ford Motor Company.  Then at age 44, he became Kennedy’s secretary of defense.

PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY:  (From tape.)  I’ve asked Robert McNamara to assume the responsibilities of secretary of defense.

WILLIAMS:   He was in on the planning of the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba, a disaster for Kennedy early in his presidency.  Then came Vietnam.
McNamara admitted much later it was really just a civil war between north and south, but at the time, the height of the Cold War, the U.S.
jumped in to stop the domino theory from playing out – the fear of nations falling to the communists one by one.  And little by little it
escalated to a half million Americans in the fight and 58,000 dead.  It became widely known as “McNamara’s War.”

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  South Vietnam is such a complex situation.  One must always look at the plusses and the minuses.

WILLIAMS:  At first the U.S. tried sheer might, a bombing campaign under McNamara called “Rolling Thunder.”  Years later, the problem was how to
get out.

By the time he left government and was given the Medal of Freedom by LBJ, McNamara was a broken man.  It was clear he would always be identified
with the war and when he started to speak at his farewell ceremony, it was clear he knew it.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  Mr. President, I cannot find words to express what lies in my heart today.  And I think I’d better respond on another
occasion.

WILLIAMS:  He went on to run the World Bank, but then McNamara largely disappeared from public life and public view for years.  He then broke
his silence with a book, “In Retrospect.”  In it, he said he and others had been wrong, terribly wrong in executing the war the way they did.

Then came a powerful documentary “The Fog of War.”  It chronicled McNamara’s World War II experience targeting cities for fire-bombings and the
staggering toll of civilian deaths.  In it, he admits he could have been tried as a war criminal if the allies had lost.  Viewers got to see
McNamara as an old man – his famously slicked-back hair now thinning, his voice reedy, his level of regret not always easy to pin down.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  A lot of people misunderstand the war, misunderstand me.  A lot of people think I’m a son of a –

WILLIAMS:  People were amazed to learn years later that the McNamara family offered housing to several young people who came to Washington to
protest at the height of the Vietnam War.  They slept in sleeping bags in the McNamara living room.  One of the McNamara kids was among the
protestors even though dad was an architect of the war.  It was a fairly well-kept secret back then – one of many in the life of Robert
McNamara, dead tonight at 93.

Moscow Conflict

CHARLES GIBSON:  For some with long memories, it was an extraordinary sight: The presidents from Washington and Moscow standing together
pledging to reduce nuclear warheads and launchers by as much as a third – the numbers right there.  And even for those with short memories,
thinking back to last year’s anger between Washington and Moscow over Russia’s move into the nation of Georgia, it was extraordinary.

There are areas of agreement at this U.S.-Russian summit now underway, but so too are there issues of contention.

Jake Tapper is with the president in Moscow.

JAKE TAPPER:  Good evening, Charlie.

Well, President Obama came here to Moscow pledging to reset the relationship with Russia and knowing full well that without Russia’s help it
might prove impossible to stop the nuclear threats from Iran and North Korea.  Well, today we saw some signs of progress in that relationship.
But we also saw clear indications that between the two superpowers there might be some issues on which they will never see eye-to-eye.

They stood in the Kremlin, once the symbol of what President Reagan called the “Evil Empire.”

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  (From tape.)  President Medvedev and I are committed to leaving behind the suspicion and the rivalry of the past so
that we can advance the interests that we hold in common.

TAPPER:  Those interests include a framework to reduce nuclear weapons, including warheads and launch vehicles such as missiles or submarines –
actions aimed at curbing nuclear proliferation around the globe.

OBAMA:  (From tape.)  The United States and Russia must lead by example.

TAPPER:  President Obama also heralded Russia’s agreement to let the U.S. use the airspace of its former Cold War enemy to transfer troops and
military equipment to fight the war in Afghanistan.  But other tensions persist.

OBAMA:  (From tape.)  We’ve had some frank discussions and there are areas where we still disagree.

TAPPER:  Russia’s occupation of parts of Georgia, for instance.

OBAMA:  (From tape.)  I reiterated my firm belief that Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected.

TAPPER:  The point of greatest tension – Russian President Medvedev opposes U.S. plans for a missile defense system in Eastern Europe, which
President Obama argues would be modest, built only to shoot down missiles from rogue states such as Iran or North Korea.

OBAMA:  (From tape.)  There is no scenario from our perspective in which this missile defense system would provide any protection against a
mighty Russian arsenal.

TAPPER:  President Obama has made this trip a family affair and has been trying to build up Medvedev in both personal and professional ways,
championing the Russian president’s call for more human rights, while disparaging the hard-line views of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.

But Russian experts question whether this will work.

MASHA LIPMAN [Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]:  (From tape.)  One reason why Putin grew so popular during his presidency was that he
stood up against the West.  I think the U.S. totally lacks leverage as far as Russian domestic situation is concerned.

TAPPER:  Polls here indicate that more Russians think that Putin has more power than Medvedev, but when President Obama was directly asked whom
he thought was the boss, he did his best to avoid answering the question.  Charlie?

GIBSON:  Jake Tapper, with the president in Moscow tonight, thanks.

Robert McNamara, 1916-2009

GIBSON:  We have a death to report tonight: one of the architects – maybe the principal architect of the Vietnam War.

Robert S. McNamara was a man of extraordinary accomplishment.  As head of the World Bank, he worked to eradicate hunger.  He was called the
“Conscience of the West.”  And before coming to Washington, he had modernized the Ford Motor Company, pulling the plug on the ill-fated Edsel.
But all of it – everything – is overshadowed by Vietnam.

PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY:  (From tape.)  I’ve asked Robert McNamara to assume the responsibilities of Secretary of Defense.

GIBSON:  For seven years under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, McNamara directed the escalation of our commitment in Vietnam.  He was so
enmeshed in the conflict that by 1964, people were calling it “McNamara’s War.”

ROBERT S. MCNAMARA [Former Secretary of Defense]:  (From tape.)  And our firepower advantage is immense.  Why shouldn’t we expect to achieve a
military advantage?

GIBSON:  But in private, it’s been learned McNamara came to have serious doubts that the U.S. could win in Vietnam.  After he expressed them to
President Johnson, he was given the Medal of Freedom and shown the door.

Indeed, McNamara spent the rest of his life agonizing over the war; it seemed to haunt him.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  We were wrong, terribly wrong.  And we owe it to future generations to explain why.

GIBSON:  McNamara continued his public mea culpa in Errol Morris’ Oscar-winning documentary “The Fog of War.”

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  Any military commander who is honest with himself or with those he is speaking to will admit that he has made mistakes
in the application of military power.  He’s killed people unnecessarily – his own troops or other troops – through mistakes, through errors of
judgment.

GIBSON:  Robert McNamara was 93 years old.

China Riots

GIBSON:  Overseas in China today, more than 150 people were killed and 800 injured in rioting in Northwest Xinjiang Province.  It resulted from
ethnic tensions between Uyghur Muslims and China’s Han majority.  Vehicles were burned, store fronts smashed before the police moved in.  One
witness said the area looked like a war zone.  The violence is said to be spreading to other Chinese cities.

Afghan Attacks

GIBSON:  In Afghanistan, U.S. forces suffered the highest single day loss of life in nearly a year.  A total of seven U.S. troops were killed in
a series of bombing attacks and firefights.

Meanwhile, a suicide bomber attacked a gate of the main NATO base in Southern Afghanistan.  Two civilians were killed; 14 others, including two
Afghan soldiers, were wounded.

The President’s Trip

KATIE COURIC:  Turning overseas now, President Obama and his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev took a major step on arms control today.  They
signed a tentative deal to cut U.S. and Russian nuclear warheads by about a third.  That would still leave each side with more than 1,500.  But
Mr. Obama said today’s agreement means the superpowers have turned a corner.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  (From tape.)  The relationship between Russia and the United States has suffered from a sense of drift.  We resolved to
reset U.S.-Russian relationships so that we can cooperate more effectively in areas of common interests.

COURIC:  The Russians also agreed today to allow their airspace to be used for American military flights carrying troops and equipment to
Afghanistan.

U.S. Troops Killed

COURIC:  This was the deadliest day for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in nearly a year.  Roadside bombs killed six in separate attacks in the north
and south, while in the east one soldier was killed in a firefight with insurgents.

Robert McNamara, 1916-2009

COURIC:  Long before Afghanistan, there was Vietnam and few were more closely identified with that war than Robert McNamara.  He played a key
role in its escalation, though much later he denounced the war.  McNamara died today; he was 93.

From the Pentagon, here’s David Martin.

DAVID MARTIN:  If ever there was a cautionary tale, it is that of Robert McNamara, the best and the brightest of John F. Kennedy’s new frontier.


PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY:  (From tape.)  I’ve asked Robert McNamara to assume the responsibilities of secretary of defense.

MARTIN:  He became the architect of the Vietnam War, in which America set out to stop the countries of Southeast Asia from falling like dominoes
to communism, only to find out –

ROBERT S. MCNAMARA [Former Secretary of Defense]:  (From tape.)  We were wrong.  We didn’t have our history, we didn’t have our culture (correct
?).

MARTIN:  He told that to President Johnson and from then on tried to at least limit the killing.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  I want to emphasize to you I failed.  And that failure is my responsibility.

MARTIN:  The older he got, the more clearly he saw his mistakes.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  What I’m doing is saying through with hindsight, but you don’t have hindsight available at the time.

MARTIN:  There are many among those who fought in Vietnam and the families of the 58,000 dead who can never forgive McNamara.  But give him
this: by the end of his extraordinary life, he had owned up to his mistakes.

David Martin, CBS News, the Pentagon.

SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRET BAIER        FNC

Moscow Meeting

BRET BAIER:  President Obama says he and his Russian counterpart are committed to putting the suspicion and rivalry of the past in the past for
good.  The two leaders met in Moscow, rolling out a series of agreements on issues large and larger.

And even though serious disagreement still exists, senior White House correspondent Major Garrett reports the emphasis today was on the
positive.

MAJOR GARRETT:  The first family arrived in Moscow to minimal pageantry – a signal this summit is all business.  One ceremonial stop at Russia’s
Tomb of the Unknown preceded a lengthy one-on-one between Presidents Obama and Medvedev.  A subsequent meeting with key advisors produced a raft
of low-level agreements.

The big deals: the first sizable cuts in nuclear weapons in seven years and the first-ever Russian green light to U.S. military shipments of
lethal weapons and personnel across its airspace to Afghanistan.  But the biggest breakthrough may have been this:

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:  (From tape.)  I trust President Medvedev to not only listen and to negotiate constructively, but also to follow through
on the agreements that are contained here today.

GARRETT:  Both nations agreed to reduce current nuclear warheads stockpiles from roughly 3,000 to between 1,500 and 1,675 and to reduce delivery
systems – that’s missile, submarines and long-range bombers – from 1,600 to between 500 and 1,100.  Intense negotiations remain on specific
numbers and verification.  Analysts say these efforts could discourage other nations from obtaining nuclear weapons.

STEVEN PIFER [Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine]:  (From tape.)  If they’re not reducing, how can Washington and Moscow go to other countries
and say, you shouldn’t acquire nuclear weapons?  It may not be a silver bullet, but it certainly helps.

GARRETT:  Differences remain though on U.S. ballistic missile defense in Europe.  The Russians wanted it linked to arms reduction, an idea Mr.
Obama told Medvedev was a non-starter.  To defuse the standoff, Mr. Obama offered the Russians a compliment as he explained U.S. missile
defenses posed no threat to Moscow.

OBAMA:  (From tape.)  There is no scenario from our perspective in which this missile defense system would provide any protection against a
mighty Russian arsenal.

GARRETT:  Medvedev agreed to study future ballistic missile threats.  The White House said that meant Iran, though Medvedev, who has dismissed
Iran as a threat, never said so.  Medvedev also welcomed Mr. Obama’s ballistic missile review.

DMITRY MEDVEDEV [Russian President]:  (From tape, translated.)  Before, we just heard that all decisions have been made, they do not concern
you.

GARRETT:  But not all the sweetness and light here.  The president said he had a frank – that means cold – exchange with President Medvedev over
Georgia, saying its territorial integrity and sovereignty must be respected in the future.  But there is a thaw there as well, Bret.  The first
time since the United States suspended military-to-military cooperation with Russia after invading Georgia in August of 2008, those have been
restarted and the U.S. and Russian military expect to have 20 exchanges this year alone.  Bret?

BAIER:  Frank discussions are always a little chilly.  Major, so far it’s been all about Medvedev, but tomorrow there’s some time set aside for
the president to meet with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.  What can you tell us about that?

GARRETT:  That’s right, Bret.  Usually when a U.S. president meets the prime minister, it’s a diplomatic formality – just an expression of
kindness.  Not here in Russia, because Vladimir Putin exercises power right alongside President Medvedev.  That was very clear at the press
conference today when the president sidestepped the question: Who is really in charge here in Russia?  He said, well, President Medvedev is the
president and Prime Minister Putin is the prime minister, and that’s the way they set things up here.  Clearly, these two wield power
effectively together.

The president will meet for the very first time with Putin over breakfast tomorrow.  The president has said Mr. Putin still has one foot in the
Cold War; Prime Minister Putin disagrees strongly.  We’ll probably see a little bit of that friction evidenced tomorrow morning.  Bret?

BAIER:  Major Garrett traveling with the president in Moscow.

Muslim Rioting In China

BAIER:  At least 156 people have been killed in rioting in Western China.  It’s been described as the worst ethnic unrest in the region in
decades.

National correspondent Catherine Herridge has the story.

CATHERINE HERRIDGE:  China’s state-controlled media portrayed the violence in Xinjiang as part of a concerted campaign by the Muslim Uyghurs to
terrorize the Han Chinese.  Chinese women were shown repeatedly covered in blood, apparently in shock as violence swept through the capital
Urumchi.

At one hospital, this young Chinese woman claims she was beaten by the demonstrators on her way home from work.  Uyghur exiles say the
demonstrations were part of a youth movement which used the internet and blogs to organize a peaceful protest after Uyghur migrant workers were
beaten and killed by the Chinese.

The protest became bloody, they say, only after the communist regime cracked down.  The use of the internet and social networking sites is a
striking parallel between these demonstrations and those in Tehran last month.

NURY TURKEL [Uyghur American Association]:  (From tape.)  It is Chinese government’s nightmare.  As you may recall during the Iranian uprising
or demonstration, one of the few countries came out and supported Ahmadinejad is the communist China.

HERRIDGE:  Analysts also note the communist government successfully blocked the Chinese version of YouTube and other material which could have
revealed how more than 140 people were killed and hundreds detained.

JOHN TKACIK [Former Foreign Service Officer]:  (From tape.)  Judging from what I saw in the websites this morning, the pictures that got through
were fairly mild.  There was nothing there that indicated to me the scale of the kind of violence that was taking place.

HERRIDGE:  And like the Iranian regime, China is blaming foreigners – in this case, a Uyghur exile in the U.S.  Rebiya Kadeer is accused of,
quote, “masterminding the violence,” a claim she denies.

In a statement, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the White House is, quote, “deeply concerned over the high number of deaths and injuries in
Western China.”  The White House statement went no further, citing the lack of independent information about the circumstances surrounding the
protest.

In Washington, Catherine Herridge, Fox News.

Rising Violence In Afghanistan

BAIER:  Seven American soldiers were killed today in three separate incidents inside Afghanistan.

National security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has an update from the Pentagon.

JENNIFER GRIFFIN:  A firefight erupted in Eastern Afghanistan this weekend, not far from where a U.S. soldier was kidnapped by the Taliban.
Today proved to be the deadliest day for U.S. troops across Afghanistan in nearly a year as the Marines pushed farther into the Southern Helmand
Province.

The Marines have encountered little resistance so far as Taliban fighters fled the province, waiting patiently assuming the Americans will
eventually leave.  The biggest threat in the south?  The heat.

SIMON TRUJILLO [U.S. Navy Medic]:  (From tape.)  After a while, your body shuts down.  You can’t sweat anymore, so you can’t – your body can’t
cool itself off.  Your core temperature rises.  Once it gets over 104, your brain pretty much starts cooking.

GRIFFIN:  U.S. forces are now operating under stricter guidelines to avoid civilian casualties following a new tactical directive by the new
U.S. commander.  Quote, “I expect the leaders at all levels to scrutinize and limit the use of force, like close air support against residential
compounds.”  Searches of Afghan homes must now be done by Afghan security forces.

In Moscow, President Obama said the first emphasis should be on training the Afghan military.

OBAMA:  (From tape.)  We have to combine that with more effective diplomatic efforts and we have to focus on development so that, for example,
the people of Afghanistan don’t have to grow poppy, but have other crops and goods that they can make a living with.

GRIFFIN:  But so far, a nonmilitary surge has not materialized and only a few State Department representatives have been assigned to Helmand.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs has assured U.S. commanders they will get what they need in terms of troops, but they will need to justify any
new request.

ADM. MIKE MULLEN [Joint Chiefs Chairman]:  (From tape.)  We have to make sure that every single American that is there is one that we absolutely
need.

GRIFFIN:  U.S. commanders overseeing the new strategy were irked during a recent visit to Afghanistan by National Security Adviser Jim Jones
when they were told not to ask for more troops, which some argued make pursuing a counterinsurgency somewhat difficult.  Bret?

BAIER:  Jen, is the military any closer to finding that kidnapped U.S. soldier in Afghanistan?

GRIFFIN:  They say they haven’t made any contact with any particular group.  They’ve received no proof of life yet.  They aren’t clear whether
these claims by a Taliban group on their website, whether they, in fact, are holding this private who disappeared last Tuesday.  Bret?

BAIER:  Okay.  We’ll follow that one.  Jennifer Griffin live at the Pentagon, thank you.

More Sanctions?

BAIER:  The United Nations Security Council is meeting right now to discuss North Korea’s latest missile tests.  The regime fired seven
ballistic missiles Saturday.  They landed in the Sea of Japan.  The Security Council expanded previous sanctions against North Korea last month.

Cadets Begin Schooling

BAIER:  While most recent high school graduates have a few more weeks of freedom before entering college, cadets at the nation’s military
academies are already at school.  The freshmen will spend this month going through rigorous basic training.

Correspondent Rick Leventhal reports from West Point about a tough place that’s even tougher to get into than it used to be.

MS. I [West Point]:  (From tape.)  What are you doing today?

MR. I [West Point]:  (From tape.)  Do you want to stay a cadet?

MR. II      [West Point Cadet]:  (From tape.)  Yes, sir.

MR. I [West Point]:  (From tape.)  Let’s go, hurry up.

RICK LEVENTHAL:  This isn’t your typical first day of school.

MR. I [West Point]:  (From tape.)  Move, move, move, move, go, go, go, go.

LEVENTHAL:  New cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point are test early and often.  The challenges are fierce, so is the
competition to get in.

CADETS:  (From tape.)  Do solemnly swear –

LEVENTHAL:  There were more than 11,000 applications to West Point this year – up almost 10 percent.  Only 1,300 were admitted.

MR. III [West Point Cadet]:  (From tape.)  New cadet – (inaudible) – reporting for the first time as ordered, ma’am.

LEVENTHAL:  There was a similar increase at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.  And in Annapolis, there were 40 percent more
applications to the U.S. Naval Academy.

LT. COL. DEBORAH MACDONALD [West Point Admissions Director]:  (From tape.)  I think what we’re seeing now with this generation of youngsters is
a strong desire to support not only national interests, but also be part of a team – to be something bigger than themselves.

MR. IV [West Point Cadet]:  (From tape.)  I’ve always wanted to serve my country ever since I can remember and I thought what better way than
through the military academy.

MR. V [West Point Cadet]:  (From tape.)  It’s always been something I’ve wanted to do since second grade.

MS. II [West Point Cadet]:  (From tape.)  But I’m using up my happiness now so I don’t smile too much when they yell at me.  (Laughs.)

LEVENTHAL:  Cadets say West Point has a lure all its own.  A drop in casualties in Iraq may also be helping to attract candidates and a free
education is a powerful draw, especially these days.

JOHN SZABLOWSKI [Cadet’s Father]:  (From tape.)  You know, I’m a pastor so that really helps.  I’ve got two in college already, so that’s a big
bonus.  Thanks, U.S. government – (laughs) – taxpayers.

LEVENTHAL:  Roughly one of five of these cadets won’t graduate for academic, disciplinary or other reasons.  The 80 percent who do will pay for
their education with an eight-year commitment – five years active duty, three years in the Reserves.

They also pay their dues in the barber shop.

LEVENTHAL:  (From tape.)  What about the hair cut?  Are you nervous about that?

MR. VI [West Point Cadet]:  (From tape.)  I’m excited about that.  I haven’t cut it for a long time just for that.  I’m saving it – I’m not
going to cut it, they’re going to cut it.

LEVENTHAL:  Actually, it’s more of a shaving than a cut.

MS. III [Barber]:  (From tape.)  You’re definitely going to need some sunscreen on your head and don’t forget your ears.  They haven’t seen the
light of day in a while, you know.

MR. VII [West Point]:  (From tape.)  The new cadet come up behind my line, up behind my line, up behind my line.

MR. VIII [West Point]:  (From tape.)  You can’t lean forward, turn around.

LEVENTHAL:  Reporting to the cadet in the red sash may be one of the easier tasks for these future Army second lieutenants.  About 1,000 of them
will be commissioned in 2013.

At West Point, New York, Rick Leventhal, Fox News.

Former Secretary Of Defense Dies

BAIER:  The man who for many was the face of the Vietnam War has died.  Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara was 93.

State Department correspondent James Rosen looks back at one of the most controversial figures of the 1960s.

JAMES ROSEN:  As a Republican and president of the Ford Motor Company, Robert S. McNamara was an unusual choice to run the Defense Department
under President Kennedy.  But the whiz kid had spearheaded Ford’s postwar expansion and brought managerial genius to the Pentagon.

PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY:  (From tape.)  This government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup
on the island of Cuba.

ROSEN:  During the Cuban missile crisis, it was McNamara who outlined the options for President Kennedy.

ROBERT S. MCNAMARA [Former Secretary of Defense]:  (From tape.)  I don’t see any way to get those weapons out of Cuba, never have thought we
would get them out of Cuba, without the application of substantial force.

ROSEN:  He became in the Johnson administration an early advocate for aerial bombing of North Vietnam and he also came to recognize its futility
much sooner than he ever admitted, says historian Gareth Porter, author of “Perils of Dominance.”

GARETH PORTER [“Perils of Dominance” Author]:  (From tape.)  Even in the spring and summer of 1965, he was supporting escalation despite the
fact that he understood that the United States could not win militarily and would have to negotiate.  And I think that really is the tragedy of
Robert S. McNamara.

ROSEN:  In his bestselling 1995 memoir, “In Restrospect,” McNamara admitted he and his fellow policymakers were, quote, “wrong, terribly wrong”
in their calculations about the Vietnam War.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  Unless we’re willing to commit genocide and run the risk of major war with China and Russia, we could not have defeated
them.

ROSEN:  After 13 years as head of the World Bank, McNamara entered a kind of purgatory, forever doing penance for his role as an architect of
the Vietnam War.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  Any military commander who is honest with himself or with those he is speaking to, will admit that he has made mistakes
in the application of military power.

ROSEN:  Many saw him as a war criminal; many others as a scapegoat.

MICHAEL LIND [“Vietnam: The Necessary War” Author]:  (From tape.)  McNamara, perhaps more than anyone of that generation apart from Kissinger
himself, you know, has suffered from the tendency of people to cast world politics as a melodramatic struggle between pure good and pure evil.


ROSEN:  Robert McNamara was 93.

In Washington, James Rosen, Fox News.

Cross-Dressing Militants Fool Marines

WOLF BLITZER:  Important news in Afghanistan.  The war there growing more deadly and more complicated for U.S. forces.  And they are now
operating under new rules designed to limit civilian casualties and gain civilian trust.  But those very same rules resulted in an almost
unbelievable twist that let Taliban militants to simply walk away from a standoff with U.S. Marines.  Those Taliban militants were dressed in
burkas as women.

Our Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence is following all these developments for us.

Really an amazing turn of events and a very, very serious confrontation that’s unfolding in Afghanistan right now.  Chris?

CHRIS LAWRENCE:  Hard to believe, Wolf.  You know, insurgents in Afghanistan are taking women and children hostage and then stealing their
clothes to evade capture.  That’s right – cross-dressing insurgents and how they fooled the U.S. military.

U.S. officials predicted violence would spike in Afghanistan, and it has.  Four American soldiers died Monday when their vehicles hit a roadside
bomb in Kunduz Province.  A suicide bomber attacked the main NATO base in Kandahar, and two more U.S. troops were killed by an explosion in the
south.

The Marines keep pushing into Taliban-controlled towns.  U.S. troops were issued a new tactical directive that basically says troops will assume
more risk to make sure they don’t harm civilians.  Part of it reads: “Any entry into an Afghan house should always be accomplished by Afghan
forces and account for the unique cultural sensitivities toward local women.”

That was put to the test Monday when Marines were battling insurgents in Khan Neshin.  The insurgents ran into a compound with women and
children inside.  The Marines held their fire and settled into a stand-off.  At 6:30 a.m., a group of women and children leave the compound.
They say there are no more civilians inside, but Marines continue to hold their fire.

Sure enough, at 7:30, another group of women and children walk south.  And after 8:00, a woman comes out screaming, with a bullet wound in her
hand.  As the Marines rush over to help her, one last group of women come out covered head to toe.  These women just walked away.  And when the
Marines went into the compound, it’s empty.  The cross-dressing insurgents had walked right past them.

Even the troops describe these women as broad-shouldered, with hairy feet.  So how did it happen?

Well, even the troops say when these insurgents came out dressed as women, they had at least two kids with them, which added to the disguise.
And the Americans didn’t have any females with them to conduct searches, so they erred on the side of caution and refused to cause a potential
cultural incident by having Marines pat down Afghan women.  Wolf?

BLITZER:  It could be very, very deadly caution, as well.  All right.  Thanks very much, Chris, for that.

Khamenei Blames Unrest On “Enemies”

BLITZER:  In Iran, the supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, spoke out today against what he called enemies and outsiders, and he’s
blaming them for the political unrest following the contested presidential election.

Defiance At The Top

BLITZER:  The former presidential candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi, also spoke publicly today for the first time in a week.  He’s quoted as vowing
to continue leading government opposition.  And now, critical new support for his cause.  Some top Iranian clerics are questioning the election
and the government’s response.

Let’s bring in CNN’s Brian Todd.  He’s been looking into this – potentially a pretty significant development.  Brian?

BRIAN TODD:  They certainly are, Wolf.  Real rumblings in Iran that have a lot of us bracing right now.  A fresh round of defiance in Iran, an
ominous counterattack by members of the government leadership, adding up to some signs that Iran may be seeing – may be seeing in the coming
days a second wave of political confrontation.

Part of Iran’s religious establishment from the holy city of Qom now openly questions the election results.  Former President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani, an ayatollah who heads the group responsible for appointing or removing Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, says: “I don’t think any
wakened consciousness would be satisfied with the post-election crackdown.”

Some grand ayatollahs make their own statements critical of the regime, as do some senior clerics at a seminary in Qom.

Perspective from an Islamic scholar once jailed under the Shah.

PROF. ABBAS MILANI [Stanford University]:  (From tape.)  All of this put together is, I think, creating the historic challenge to the regime and
to Khamenei’s leadership.

TODD:  Contacted by CNN, an Iranian official discounted the influence of the clerics’ statements.  But he warns leadership is lashing out at
what it calls “interlopers from outside.”

AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMEINI [Iran’s Supreme Leader]:  (From tape, translated.)  The Iranian nation warns the heads of countries who try to benefit
from an internal issue of our country.  Against the Iranian nation you should be careful.

TODD:  And a key adviser to Khamenei writes in an editorial that opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi could be working for the Americans.

An Islamic scholar critical of the regime says Khamenei has to quickly move beyond accusations and reconcile with his strongest critics.

PROF. MOHSEN KADIVAR [Duke University]:  (From tape.)  He should repair the trust of the people, in one hand; and also he needs the support of
grand ayatollahs of Qom seminary in the other hand.  If he cannot provide these two, I think it will be a crisis.

TODD:  But it’s not clear what the regime is about to do.  A source in Iran with firsthand knowledge of the situation says it does not look like
there will be imminent action by the government to move against those clerics in Qom.  The clerics who have weighed in against the government,
even some of those grand ayatollahs, are not the only important members of the clergy there.  Experts say there are several grand ayatollahs who
have remained completely silent so far.  Many are watching for what they do next, Wolf.  They may signal the real shift in the religious
leadership against the government, if they say something.

BLITZER:  But the former presidential candidate, the opposition leader, Mir Hossein Mousavi, he’s – he’s vowing to continue his fight.

TODD:  That’s right.  He is planning on filing papers in the coming days for a new political party aimed at reigning in the power of the current
regime.  He says he’s going to file those new papers before Ahmadinejad is sworn in, later this month or early next.

So he is going to press ahead.  He may be pushing that envelope to see just how far he can take this before the government comes back after him.

BLITZER:  We’re going to stay on top of this story – obviously, significant developments in Iran.  Brian, thank you.

Rioting In China

BLITZER:  In China, at least 156 people are dead and more than 800 wounded after riots broke out in what appears to be the deadliest unrest
since the Tiananmen Square massacre 20 years ago.

As we hear from CNN’s Emily Chang, ethnic tensions boiled over in the western region and Chinese police crack down.

EMILY CHANG:  Protestors commandeered the streets of Urumqi in Northwestern China, screaming, chanting, swelling, these pictures from China’s
state-run media.  An eyewitness says throngs of ethnic Uighurs – men, women and children – left their market stands in the city’s bazaar
district to join in.  Chinese riot police responded swiftly pushing the crowds back.

The witness, an American studying in Urumqi, says that’s when the crowds turned violent throwing rocks, vegetables, setting vehicles on fire.

AMERICAN STUDENT:  (From tape.)  They were slapping car windows, driving by, smashing bus windows which had been evacuated.  You know, once
things got really heavy and there was tear gas.  I heard several spouts of gunfire, explosions.

CHANG:  Police reportedly fired shots over the crowd.  The riots quickly hit Chinese blogs.  Netizens spread video and photos like these online,
though they cannot be independently verified by CNN.  In the end, state media reports at least 140 people killed, more than 800 injured.

The Chinese government says the latest protests were masterminded by activists outside the country, saying the violence is a preempted organized
violent crime.  It is instigated and directed from abroad and carried out by outlaws in the country.

But many protestors reportedly said they are angry about how the Chinese government handled another incident in Southern China at a toy factory
in Guangdong.  State-run media reports an ex-employee started a rumor that a group of Uighur men raped two Han Chinese women.  It led to a
massive brawl between Uighur and Han Chinese factory workers and ended with two Uighurs killed and may have ignited this bloody outpouring of
pent-up frustration in Urumqi.

Emily Chang, CNN, Beijing.

BLITZER:  And as Emily just reported, tensions between Uighurs and the Han Chinese have long simmered in the Xinjiang Province.  Uighurs, a
predominantly Muslim community, make up nearly half the population in the province.  The province in the far western part of China borders eight
Central Asian nations including Russia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, some to the bulk of China’s natural resources, including a large reserve of
oil and gas.

Pakistani Army’s Disturbing Video

BLITZER:  The Taliban had boasted to CNN they have a three-month supply of suicide bombers.

Nic Robertson has now learned young boys – very young boys may, in fact, be among them.  We want to caution you, viewers may find some of the
images in this reporting very disturbing.  Nic?

NIC ROBERTSON:  Wolf, as the Pakistani army offensive against the Taliban expands, one of the things that is concerning the army is the
increased use of suicide bombers.  What they are discovering, they say, is that the Taliban are exploiting children, turning them into deadly
killers.

In this disturbing video released by Pakistan’s army, young children are being taught to be terrorists.  The brutal killings they commit in
front of a camera are barbaric, but what worries the army most are those being trained to be suicide bombers, increasingly, the Taliban’s
preferred form of attack.

The Taliban seem to have so many suicide bombers now.  They can use them on relatively low-level targets.  Just a few days ago right here they
attacked a government bus full of workers.  What really worries officials is the suicide bomber was riding a motorbike.  And they are worried
the younger the attackers get, the easier it is for them to get into the cities undetected.

MAJ. GEN. AKHTAR ABBAS [Army Spokesman]:   (From tape.)  Somebody is approaching on foot and there is a possibility that he would bypass
security in certain areas.  There is a possibility that in the population centers, everybody cannot be checked physically, so he can create
havoc there also.

ROBERTSON:  In a recent interview with CNN, this Afghan Taliban spokesman boasted three months’ supply of suicide bombers, a threat the army
here admits may be based on fact.  What they are discovering is it’s the Pakistani Taliban at camps like this one inside Pakistan who are
producing the young bombers, often selling them on to other Taliban commanders.

ABBAS:  (From tape.)  We have been intercepting messages that the others have been demanding like Fazlullah group in Swat and Faqir Mohammed and
others in other agencies.  They have been asking him for the suicide bombers.  They wanted to use them at one stage of the battle.

ROBERTSON:  According to Pakistan’s military, children as young as 11 are being brainwashed into attacks.  Both the army here and U.S. defense
intelligence experts blame Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban.

ABBAS:  (From tape.)  He has been admitting that he has – he holds a training center for young boys preparing them for suicide bombing.  So he
is on record saying all these, accepting all these crimes.

ROBERTSON:  Mehsud, who never shows his face to the camera, is the country’s most wanted man.  The army is gambling they get him and his
network, they dry up the supply of suicide bombers.

The army says that some of these children are orphans, some are being kidnapped.  Some of them come from religious schools, but the concern is
that another Taliban commander might just pick up and carry on when Baitullah Mehsud leaves off.  Wolf?

BLITZER:  Nic Robertson reporting for us from Pakistan.  What a story.  Thank you, Nic, for that excellent reporting.

Soldiers Killed

JIM LEHRER:  In other news today, seven U.S. troops were killed in attacks across Afghanistan.  It was the deadliest day in nearly a year.  Six
Americans were killed in roadside bombings in the north and in the south near where U.S. Marines are waging a major offensive.  Another died in
clashes with insurgents in the eastern part of the country.

Captured

LEHRER:  Meanwhile, the Taliban confirmed capturing a U.S. soldier last week.  There were no details in what the militants will do with him.

Deadly Riots

LEHRER:  Ethnic riots across Western China have now claimed at least 156 lives.  Violence erupted on Sunday in the capital city of Xinjiang
Province.  In addition to the dead, more than 800 people were hurt.

We have a report narrated by Lindsey Hilsum of Independent Television News.

LINDSEY HILSUM [ITN]:  Mobs on the streets of Urumchi, groups of youths who hate Chinese rule.  Yesterday, several thousand people from the
Muslim Uighur minority went on a rampage.  They say they face discrimination and they took out their anger on the Han.  The Han are regarded as
colonialists by many Uighurs who would like a separate state.

This Han woman was kicked and stabbed.  The hospitals are full of injured.  The government says more than 800 people were hurt – some badly,
mostly beaten with sticks or stabbed by youths with knives.

WOMAN [Injured Han Woman]:  (From tape, translated.)  It seemed like they were in groups of more than ten.  There was no chance to say anything.
 They just came up and attacked you.

MAN [Injured Han Man]:  (From tape, translated.)  They didn’t really talk to you.  When they saw a Han person coming along, they started to
attack, or when a bus came along they started to attack.Han

HILSUM:  The story starts ten days ago in a factory in Southern China.  Fighting broke out between Uighurs and Han after a Han accused a Uighur
man of rape.  The allegation is believed to be untrue, but several Uighurs were lynched nonetheless.  The horrifying pictures shot by mobile
phone were seen by Uighurs back home in Urumchi.

Yesterday, Uighur university students in the Xinjiang capital held what seemed initially to have been a peaceful demonstration demanding an
inquiry.  The Chinese government is blaming exiled Uighur separatists for the violence which followed.

NUER BAIKELI [Chairman of Xinjiang Region]:  (From tape, translated.)  The three forces from inside and outside of China aggressively operated
to attack China’s Communist Party and the government.  They also incited people to carry out demonstrations in the city.

HILSUM:  Today, the Han were counting the cost.  Their government encouraged them to move to Xinjiang Province to make Urumchi a Chinese rather
than a Uighur city.  It’s not clear whether the violence was one-sided or whether Uighurs were also killed by government forces.

By this afternoon, Urumchi was totally locked down.  Hundreds have been arrested.  The Chinese government will see such unrest and the large
death toll as a major challenge not only to its authority, but to its sovereignty.

LEHRER:  The U.S. reacted to the situation late today.  A White House statement called for all parties in Western China to exercise restraint.

Missile Response

LEHRER:  Members of the U.N. Security Council talked today about responding to North Korea’s latest move.  On Saturday, the North Koreans defied
the U.N. and fired seven mid-range ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan.  The missiles have the range to strike all of South Korea and most
of Japan.

Moscow Summit

LEHRER: President Obama moved to reset U.S. relations with Russia today. He journeyed to Moscow to push for progress on nuclear weapons and
missile defense.

Judy Woodruff has our lead story report.

WOODRUFF: The president's visit to Moscow marked the first U.S.- Russia summit in seven years. He began by laying a wreath at Russia's Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier. Then, it was on to the Kremlin to meet with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev.

The pair emerged later to report they're trying for a new era of goodwill after recent years of rocky relations.

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: (From tape.)  The president and I agreed that the relationship between Russia and the United States has suffered from a
sense of drift. We resolved to reset U.S.-Russian relations so that we can cooperate more effectively in areas of common interest.

DMITRY MEDVEDEV [President of Russia]: (From tape, translated.)  I view them as a first, but very important step in the process of improving
full-scale cooperation between our two countries, which should go to the benefit of both states.

WOODRUFF: To that end, the leaders announced a joint understanding for a follow-on treaty to START, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. It's
due to expire this December.

The new goal is to cut strategic warheads to 1,500 to 1,675 on each side from the current maximum of 2,200. The two nations also committed to
cutting delivery systems to 500 to 1,100 a side. Right now, the limit is 1,600.

President Medvedev said it is also important to work together on preventing other countries from gaining nuclear weapons.

MEDVEDEV: (From tape, translated.)  There are regions around the world where the presence of nuclear arms would create huge problems, and these
are areas where we should concentrate our efforts together with our American partners.

WOODRUFF: Medvedev did not directly name Iran, but Mr. Obama did when it came turn for his response.

OBAMA: (From tape.)  In the Middle East, there is deep concern about Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability, not simply because of one
country wanting nuclear weapons, but the fact that, if Iran obtained nuclear weapons, it is an almost -- it is almost certain that other
countries in the region would then decide to pursue their own programs. And we would then see a nuclear arms race in perhaps the most volatile
part of the world.

WOODRUFF: The U.S. has cited that threat as justification for placing a missile defense system in Eastern Europe, but Russia opposes any such
plan, and there was no official resolution today.

OBAMA: (From tape.)  The difference that we've had has been on the specifics of a missile defense system that the United States views as a
priority not to deal with Russia, but to deal with a missile coming in from Iran or North Korea or some other state, and that it's important for
the United States and its allies to have the capacity to prevent such a strike.

WOODRUFF: Medvedev called it a "difficult area," but he suggested there might be progress.

MEDVEDEV: (From tape, translated.)  We talk about the linkage between offensive and defensive weapons, and this already constitutes a step
forward. Sometime ago, on this question, we had all only differences. Now this linkage is being stated, and this opens up the opportunity of
bringing positions closer to each other.

WOODRUFF: The Russians also agreed today to allow use of their airspace to transport U.S. troops and equipment to Afghanistan. Tomorrow,
President Obama is scheduled to sit down with Vladimir Putin, Russia's former president and current prime minister.

Margaret Warner is covering the story for us in Moscow. I talked with her a little while ago.

Margaret, hello. First of all, did the U.S. get what it wanted and expected on arms control?

MARGARET WARNER: Judy, they didn't get quite as low numbers as they'd hoped in terms of reducing long-range missiles and their launchers, but
we're told that, as of late last week, they had no firm agreement on even announcing any targets and that President Obama talked to President
Medvedev on the phone and that's how they even got these numbers, which are roughly about a 30 percent cut in missiles and -- no, I think that's
25 percent in missiles and 30 percent in launchers.

President Obama did come here with the White House hoping that in his one-on-one with President Medvedev he would be able to persuade President
Medvedev to drop the numbers even lower; that did not happen.

But, all in all, I would say that the U.S. side is pleased with the commitment and pleased also with the relationship that seems to have
developed in negotiations, and they stressed to us that the first START treaty took nine years to negotiate, so, really, that the progress
they've made just in a few months is quite remarkable.

WOODRUFF: And what about on the Russian side? Did they get what they wanted on missile defense?

WARNER: President Medvedev said he had agreement from President Obama that missile defense and missile offense are linked. President Obama said
theoretically, yes, of course they are, but that when you're talking about this European defense system that the U.S. wants to try to set up in
some fashion, that that is just way too modest to be of any threat to Russia's nuclear capability.

Apparently, in their one-on-one -- which went well over an hour, and, in fact, it went quite long, it went about an hour-and-a-half, longer than
they expected -- it really focused on missile defense, which they agreed to do a threat assessment of the danger posed by missiles in the
region, and, two, Iran, and that the two were totally linked.

And at one point, President Medvedev, though he never let the word "Iran" pass his lips at the press conference, did say, did speak about the
concern of the growing missile threat in the region and the nuclear threat. And he talked about countries that want to join the nuclear club or,
he said worse, are pursuing it clandestinely, which was a pretty clear reference to Iran.

WOODRUFF: And, Margaret, the Afghanistan agreement. What do U.S. officials say is significant about that?

WARNER: They are very pleased by this agreement. This agreement, Judy, will allow the U.S. to transport not just what they call lethal or
military supplies into Afghanistan, which the Russians had already announced a couple days ago they were going to do, but troops. And that means
that U.S. forces can fly from Germany into Afghanistan through Russian airspace.

What's more, I'm told by one of the president's aides, the Russians are going to really relax all their usual kind of bureaucratic paperwork
requirements of knowing who's on the manifest and checking it out. I mean, they still will have the ability to do that on a case-by-case basis
if they want to, but essentially they're going to be very accommodating about it.

Finally, they are actually going to pay these, quote, "navigation fees," which usually the U.S. would have to pay to -- I guess it's air traffic
controllers on the ground. The Russians are actually going to absorb that cost.

The other thing that's significant about their cooperation on Afghanistan as it goes beyond the transit, they're talking about working together
to build, you know, a more modern society -- that's the way President Medvedev describes it -- in Afghanistan. And President Obama, as you may
know, did talk about perhaps the Russians can help in training the Afghan army or police.

So bottom line is, the Russians had gone from being obstacles at times, as they were earlier this year when they persuaded another former
republic, Kyrgyzstan, to close its air base to the U.S., in the region and now are seeing themselves as cooperative partners in the Afghanistan
effort.

WOODRUFF: But, quickly, there are still some sticking points between the two leaders on other issues?

WARNER: Absolutely, and I think that that was conveyed by their tone. They talked about wanting to cooperate in a lot of things. They also
talked about the fact that they still have major differences.

President Obama mentioned Georgia in particular. And they have agreed to disagree and to continue discussing that.

So I would say that, tone-wise, too, it was telling that, though President Obama said he certainly trusted President Medvedev to negotiate and
stick to his agreements, there was none of the gushiness, there was no looking into anyone's soul and deciding that they can work together. They
really emphasized that this is a businesslike relationship. Tone was cordial, but very businesslike, and these differences do remain.

WOODRUFF: And, finally, tell us what's on tap for tomorrow, the meeting with Putin?

WARNER: Well, that's -- of course, everyone is awaiting that eagerly. President Obama and Prime Minister Putin, whom he slipped and called
President Putin once today before catching himself, I'd say what's really important about the meeting with Prime Minister Putin tomorrow is that
it will be the first chance for President Obama to take his measure of the man. They've never met before. And I think that, above all, that's
the most important thing about that meeting.

WOODRUFF: Margaret Warner covering the summit for us in Moscow, thanks.

WARNER: Thanks, Judy.



McNamara’s Legacy

LEHRER:  And finally tonight, the legacy of Robert McNamara.  He died at his home in Washington today at the age 93.  McNamara was the
influential defense secretary for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson from 1961 to 1968.  He later became president of the World Bank.

He was best known, of course, first and foremost as the architect of the Vietnam War.  McNamara himself was skeptical, even pessimistic about
America’s chances even while he was executing the war, but he did not reveal that publicly until years later in his own memoir and eventually in
a 2003 documentary called “The Fog of War.”

Here’s a clip from that film showing what McNamara and President Johnson discussed privately about Vietnam before the 1964 election.

ROBERT MCNAMARA [Former Secretary of Defense]:  (From tape.)  If you went to the CIA and said, how’s the situation today in South Vietnam, I
think they’d say it’s worse.  You see it in the desertion rate, you see it in morale, you see it in the difficulty to recruit people, you see it
in the gradual loss of population control.  Many of us in private would say that things are not good, they’ve gotten worse.

Now, while we say this in private and not public, there are facts available that find their way in the press.  If we’re going to stay in there,
if we’re going to go up the escalating chain, we’re going to have to educate the people, Mr. President.  We haven’t done so yet.  I’m not sure
now is exactly the right time.

PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON:  (From tape.)  No, and I think if you start doing it they’re going to be hollering you’re a warmonger.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  I completely agree with you.

LEHRER:  In 1995, when his memoir was published, McNamara appeared on this program, and Robert McNeil asked him why he waited so long to
disclose misgivings about a war that claimed millions of lives, including those of 58,000 Americans.

ROBERT MCNEIL:  (From tape.)  Many people are saying – reviewers, television interviewers, others – that you should have aired your doubts 27
years ago –

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  Yes.

MCNEIL:  (From tape.)  – when it might have stopped the war sooner, they believe, and saved many lives.  And I wonder whether that almost
universal reaction these last ten days has made you reconsider the morality of your silence all those years?

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  Now, this is going to take a few seconds to –

MCNEIL:  (From tape.)  Go ahead.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  There are two different problems.  I had two fears during my years – ’65, ’66, ’67, ’68 as secretary of defense.  One
fear – and I expressed it to President Johnson in December, 1965, was that we couldn’t win the war militarily.  I said to him at that time – I
quoted in a book – there’s only one in three chance – or at best one in two chance to win militarily.  He said, are you saying we can’t win
militarily?  I said, yes.

However, the second fear was that if we pulled out of Vietnam, if Vietnam were controlled by the communists – Chinese and Soviets – it would
lead to what Eisenhower predicted in 1954, the fall of the dominoes.  In other words, the fear that if we didn’t stand firm, the communists
would take control of Southeast Asia, all of Asia and strengthen their position against the West in Europe and the U.S.  That was – and I
couldn’t reconcile those two positions, excepting only by pushing for action that would hopefully bring negotiations which would permit military
disengagement without losing Vietnam.  That was the course we were on.

MCNEIL:  (From tape.)  Mm-hmm.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  It’s a very complicated approach and it was in the end unsuccessful.

MCNEIL:  (From tape.)  But I just wonder in the last few days, with so many people saying, hey, he should have spoken out a long time ago when
it might have done some good, have you had any second thoughts about that hearing all that reaction.

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  No, what should I have said?  What should I have said that would not have brought aid and comfort to the enemy?  I was
secretary of defense – well, until February 29th of ’68.  After that I was an ex-secretary of defense.  What could I have said that would not
have brought aid and comfort?  I have – I have no regrets about not speaking out then.

I have deep regrets that we ever got involved or that I supported our involvement.  And most of all, I want to try to look back on what I think
were our mistakes – not all of my associates agree they were mistakes – but what I think were our mistakes and try to draw lessons so we won’t
make the same mistake again.

MCNEIL:  (From tape.)  You say you were prompted to write this book because you were heartsick at the cynicism, even the contempt with which
people view their political institutions today.  How did you think this book might dispel that cynicism?

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  I hope it will explore why the leaders did what they did.  My associates were properly described by that pejorative
term, “the best and the brightest.”  They were young, intelligent, well-educated, hardworking, dedicated servants of their people in the
government.  And they were wrong.  Now, I think if our people understand that, then we can talk about why were they wrong, how can we avoid
similar errors in the future?

MCNEIL:  (From tape.)  As you document, if the best and the brightest that Kennedy and Johnson could muster year after year made the mistakes
you admit and they refused to listen to their critics, to use your phrase, “were blind prisoners of their assumptions,” and the in the process
sent nearly 60,000 Americans to their deaths, would that not confirm or deepen people’s cynicism of that government?

MCNAMARA:  (From tape.)  No, I think – I hope what it will do is cause us to examine what happened then and try to prevent it in the future.

LEHRER:  Some perspective now on Robert McNamara from Errol Morris, the documentarian who made “The Fog of War,” and Deborah Shapley, author of
the biography, “Promise and Power: The Life and Times of Robert McNamara.”

Mr. Morris, to you first.  How responsible do you believe Robert McNamara was for what went wrong in Vietnam?

ERROL MORRIS [Filmmaker, “The Fog of War”]:  Well, he was certainly at the apex of that pyramid of power along with Lyndon Johnson, the two most
powerful people in the American government.

LEHRER:  But was McNamara leading the wrong course, or was he setting the wrong course?

MORRIS:  My belief – and it is informed by many of these taped phone conversations, conversations between McNamara and Johnson – the
characterization of McNamara as being the chief architect is wrong.  To me the impetus for escalation clearly came from the president.

LEHRER:  Do you agree with that, Ms. Shapley, that that calling him the architect, which I did just a moment ago, in fact – (laughs) – in
reporting the story – is incorrect?

DEBORAH SHAPLEY [Author, “Promise and Power: The Life and Times of Robert McNamara”]:  I think it’s safe to say that they were all in it
together, as they say, and that the presidents in both cases definitely set the tone – President Kennedy and President Johnson.  And, as in a
sense, McNamara was right – they were prisoners of a mindset.

There’s also no question that McNamara set most of the military policy – often over the objections of the uniformed military.  So he’s an
architect in a sense of the strategy at a different level than the whole overall question of whether we stayed or left.

LEHRER:  In the interview we did with Robert McNeil and other interviews and in his memoir and also in “The Fog of War” – Mr. Morris’ movie,
“The Fog of War,” a lot of people have said he was contrite, that he was actually apologizing.  That’s not exactly what he was doing, was it?

SHAPLEY:  No.  He gave the impression in 1995 that he actually felt they were wrong all along, that he didn’t believe it at the time.  And that
was a rather unfortunate impression because it angered a lot of veterans and made them believe that he had been lying to them all the time.  He
knew that the war was wrong, et cetera.  But in fact, in his actual memos to the president at the time and his record at the time, he kept
saying, this is going to take longer.  We’re going to have to escalate.  It’s going to go on for years.  So we’re just going to have to slog on.
 He did not actually recommend a withdrawal.  And he himself he did not leave government as you know.

LEHRER:  He held that job for seven years, longer than anybody has ever held that job.

SHAPLEY:  He held the job for seven years.  He held on in the belief that he would somehow be able to control it from getting worse.

LEHRER:  Well, Mr. Morris, what’s your view of that?  When he said – and it’s a direct quote – he said, “We were wrong,” those words, “we.”  He
didn’t say, I was wrong.  He said, “We were wrong.”  That was the phrase that was used many times.  How do you interpret what he meant by
“wrong”?

MORRIS:  That the policies were misguided, that the whole idea of a necessary war in order to prevent communist aggression failed to take into
consideration the fact that there was not international communism at work, but a country looking to establish its independence.

I think one thing that is forgotten in this whole McNamara story that returns again and again to Vietnam is that McNamara was a person who kept
the lid on – that he perceived and I think rightly so that there was an enormous danger of nuclear war and that his principal job was to prevent
that at all cost from happening.  I’m asked quite often about the relationship between Donald Rumsfeld and Robert McNamara.

LEHRER:  I haven’t asked you that.

MORRIS:  You haven’t asked me, but it’s often expressed as these two technocrats, two sides of the same coin.  And I like to remind people that
when McNamara took office in 1960, he was facing a bellicose Joint Chiefs.  There was the fear of a preemptive nuclear strike against the Soviet
Union.  And part of his story is a story of an attempt to control nuclear weapons and to prevent the possibility of nuclear war.

LEHRER:  Ms. Shapley, does your reporting and research that you did for your biography of McNamara support what Mr. Morris is saying?

SHAPLEY:  Well, a great deal of it, but to come back to why he didn’t speak out sooner, he had two arguments and these were discussions that I
had with him and also with Mac Bundy and other advisers as to why he didn’t –

LEHRER:  Mac Bundy was a national security adviser during that time.

SHAPLEY:  There were two fears.  One was if he went public and said, this thing isn’t working out, it would give comfort to the enemy.  You just
heard him say that.

LEHRER:  Right.

SHAPLEY:  And Ho Chi Minh would have been dancing in the streets.  He would have redoubled his efforts and there would have been more U.S. guys
dead.  So it didn’t compute from the standpoint of someone in the chain of command who had sent these fellows out there to go public and say,
hey boys, I was wrong.  The secretary of defense is not the same thing in a position as a journalist or a commentator or somebody standing on
the sidelines.  He has certain obligations to those people which he maintains throughout his life.  So he wasn’t going to go out and tell all
those veterans that he made a big mistake.  Then he seemed to do it later.

His other consideration was as Errol Morris has just said, that the pressures to widen the war in Vietnam are often forgotten.  And as late as
1967 when McNamara went in August before the Senate Arms Services Committee, the pressures from rebellious generals, Joint Chiefs of Staff even
that to make very drastic plans was to widen the bombing of North Vietnam and it was widely believed in the establishment in and out of
government that widening the war, the air war, which the generals said would solve it, would actually draw in the Chinese and the Russians.  And
this would be a much far greater danger to everyone’s interests than slogging on with the ground war.

LEHRER:  Back to the moving on to the more personal side, the personal side of Robert McNamara, Mr. Morris, do you believe that there was some
personal characteristic, some character flaw or some whatever that caused him to do at least what he did that turned out to be wrong in the
conduct of this war?

MORRIS:  Well, we all have character flaws, and depending on the context often a character flaw can be a character strength.  One of the
characteristics of the man, at least during the time that I knew him, incredibly fierce loyalty; I think it does inform that question, why
didn’t he speak out?  His loyalty – he said this to me many, many times that he was not elected.  He served the pleasure of the president of the
United States.  He saw himself very clearly as a public servant and never forgot that role.  I think you’re correct to talk about these
intervening years; the war continued.  He didn’t speak out.  Some 30 years passed before the publication of “In Retrospect.”  I think he always
saw himself as secretary of defense.  That loyalty was with him from the beginning and stayed with him until the very, very end.

LEHRER:  Do you agree with that?  Do you feel the same thing?  You felt that about him?

SHAPLEY:  Sure.  He would not criticize later secretaries of defense.  He wouldn’t criticize Rumsfeld over Iraq.  He was very deferential and
stayed in the role, as Errol says.  But to answer your question, what flaws caused him to make the mistakes, you know, the image that one could
now get even of McNamara in government anguished over the possible flaws and the strategy is really very misleading.  He was ferocious against
people who disagreed with the strategy.  There are many, many accounts, for example, of his treatment of Roger Hillsman would be just simply one
example, people who dared to actually question the strategy openly were treated with contempt, just told to go jump in a lake.  So he was
securing the line of continuing the war, escalating, engaging in some bombing and that this was absolutely essential for the sake of the United
States’ interests.  And that was very much the overwhelming presence of Robert McNamara in government for those eight years.

LEHRER:  All right.  We’re going to have to leave it there.  Ms. Shapley, Mr. Errol Morris, thank you both very much.

SHAPLEY:  Thank you.

MORRIS:  Thank you.

Marines Keep Pressure On Taliban


RENEE MONTAGNE:  In southern Afghanistan, U.S. Marines are setting up outposts in the towns and villages of Helmand Province.  It’s part of a
major effort to push out the Taliban and other Islamist insurgents who’ve controlled much of this region for years.  Marine commanders say, so
far, the mission has exceeded expectations.

NPR’s Jackie Northam has this report from the U.S. Marine base at Camp Leatherneck.

JACKIE NORTHAM:  The Combat Operations Center here at Camp Leatherneck is jammed with military watch officers monitoring U.S. Marine operations
as they unfold over the more than 10,000 square miles of Helmand Province.  Given the scale of this operation, the mission in Helmand so far has
gone remarkably smooth.  Marines and Afghan forces have quickly taken back towns and villages long held by the Taliban and other Islamist
insurgents.

Brigadier General Larry Nicholson is the commander of the Marines’ Helmand operation.

BRIGADIER GENERAL LARRY NICHOLSON (U.S. Marine Corps):  If our mission was to just kill Taliban, if that’s what this mission was about, we would
have done this very, very differently.  But the way that this thing was crafted and the way this thing was put together was to get to the
people, get to them quickly and start separating them from the Taliban, and I think we’re off to a good start.  But we’ve got a long way to go
and there’s going to be some tough days ahead, I’m sure of that.

NORTHAM:  Still, during an interview, Nicholson can barely suppress a grin, obviously, pleased with the progress so far.  He says insurgents are
being rounded up, as are weapons.

Captain Bill Pelletier, a Marine spokesman, said the Taliban’s mostly tactic is to wait before hitting back.

CAPTAIN BILL PELLETIER (U.S. Marine Corps):  Their spokesmen have been quoted over the last few days as saying; we’re not going to do anything.
We’re going to out-wait these guys, these Marines.  We’re going to wait them out.

NORTHAM:  What little fighting there’s been has taken place further down into the Helmand River valley region, a fertile area which produces
tens of millions of dollars of opium each year for the insurgents.  The Marines are setting up small outposts throughout the region.  Commander
Nicholson says he expects that at some point, perhaps soon, that the Taliban will try to reclaim the area.

NICHOLSON:  And I think we will see over the next couple of days the amount of engagements increase.  I think once the enemy finds out that
we’re not leaving, then the economy will probably come at us in more significant ways than it has so far.

NORTHAM:  In the meantime, there’s a push to start implementing economic and development programs in areas that have been cleared of Taliban
fighters.  Caroline Malki, a British political adviser and liaison to the Marines, says some of the areas have been without a local government
for years.  She points to the town of Nawar.

CAROLINE MALKI (British Political Adviser):  Expectations are really high, for example, now, I think, the local population believe that now the
Taliban have been kicked out, that the district center will now thrive, and hopefully, that will be true.

NORTHAM:  Malki says the international community can help initially, but Afghanistan’s central government will also have to step up to ensure
funding reaches the province to deliver services and to provide much-needed Afghan forces to help maintain security.
