Government’s Minimum Specifications



The Remote Environmental Monitoring Systems (herein referred to as the ‘system’) shall provide automated monitoring across multiple buildings.



The system shall be able to accommodate receiving data from over 150 sensors.



The system shall accommodate future growth to 450 sensors.



The system shall have web-based software that can correlate and process data from all sensors (i.e., a device manager).



The system shall provide a user interface construct such that sensor data processing can be accomplished using an in-house web-based application (for later advanced use).



The system shall be able to monitor the following via sensors: temperature, humidity, 60 Hz power availability, water presence.



For the purpose of future growth, the system shall be able to monitor the following via sensors: 400 Hz power availability, air flow/pressure, water flow/pressure, customized sensors as required for future requirements.



The system shall be able to receive input from analog sensors.



The system shall be able to notify multiple users via email, text message, and phone.



The system shall provide configurable thresholds for alarms.
