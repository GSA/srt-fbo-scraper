                                                       Biosciences Library SOW for Knovel
                                                                 October 19, 2009


Background and Purpose

The FDA Biosciences Library requires unlimited searching access to content on Knovel, a collection of over 1000 science and engineering
reference resources.  The complete list of resources is provided in the attachment.  These resources are highly valued and used by FDA
researchers in support of the Agency mission as evidenced by usage statistics.

Subscribing to Knovel eliminates the need for the Library or other offices to purchase duplicate copies of individual reference books, saving
the Agency research time and money and providing access at the desktop 24/7.

1. Scope and Requirements


     1. The FDA Biosciences Library requires a site license that includes unlimited online web access, to a select group of core technical
        reference resources based on IP authentication.  They are available 24/7 at the researcher’s desktop.

     1. The resources cover the following subject areas:  Biochemistry, Biology & Biotechnology, Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Food Science,
        General Engineering & Engineering Management, Pharmaceuticals, Cosmetics & Toiletries, Plastics & Rubbers, and Safety, Health & Hygiene.
         Knovel’s productivity tools include interactive tables and graphs that can be exported. The resources are fully indexed and searchable.
         The user interface includes a Graph Equations Tables search that retrieves numeric and other tabular data from the resources, allowing
        the user to extract precise items of interest.
     2. Additionally, our site license includes access to premium content from the following:  Patty’s Toxicology, Sax’s Dangerous Properties,
        and The Merck Index.

   2. Specific Requirements

        1. The FDA requires unlimited online access to a suite of highly technical reference resources. The comprehensive list of titles is
           attached.  We require unlocked access where an unlimited number of end users can access the resources at the same time, even when the
           number of licensed concurrent users is exceeded.  An unlimited number of users must be able to set up user profiles that will allow
           them to access the resources both within and outside of the FDA IP range. Our subscription is for one concurrent user in an unlocked
           environment with the exception of Chemistry and Food subject areas. We require two concurrent user licenses based on the high level
           of usage.


        2. For the above list, the contractor shall provide the following:


     a. A site license for 24/7 Agency web access based on IP authentication.
     b. Customer service shall be available to troubleshoot website and connectivity issues via phone and e-mail from 8:30 to 5:30 EST.
     c. Researchers and librarians need access to all of the resources and must be able to search both all and selected resources with one query
        and one interface.  They need to be able to search for information included in charts and tables included in the resources.
     d. Knovel users are prompted to set up a profile and password, enabling them to access the database from non-FDA-networked computers, set
        preferences, save searches, create folders, email links to content, and more

3.0  Description of Work

3.1   The contractor shall provide the FDA Biosciences Library with unlimited access to a search platform with a compilation of technical
reference resources that are searchable across the platform. The contractor is expected to troubleshoot access issues as needed, but it will not
be necessary to respond during non-operational hours as defined above.


3.2  Deliverables:

3.2.1 The interface is hosted on the contractor’s server and includes unlocked access.

If a plug-in or additional software is required or recommended for optimal use, please include specific requirements. Contractor will address
any questions or problems encountered when using this product with supported software or hardware.
The contractor shall provide usage statistics on a monthly basis.  The usage statistics are provided either via email or contractor provided
login and should include session count, search count and total document retrievals per title.

Contractor shall provide online tutorials.  Contractor shall also provide on-site training, promotional materials, briefings and updates to FDA
researchers, in the DC area as well as selected remote offices.


4.  Period of Performance

1/1/10 to 12/31/10

5. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
The following Section 508 standards are applicable to this requirement (See Clause).
