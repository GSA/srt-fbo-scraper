(d) The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.

(a) Offerors are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Therefore: (1) All items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked in all documents submitted to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM or The Government). Marking of items will not necessarily preclude disclosure when the OPM determines disclosure is warranted by FOIA. However, if such items are not marked, all information contained within the submitted documents will be deemed to be releasable. (2) No later than five (5) business days after award of a contract, blanket purchase agreement (BPA), or order, the Contractor must provide OPM a redacted copy of the contract/BPA/order in electronic format. This copy will be used to satisfy any requests for copies of the contract/BPA/order under the FOIA. If the Contracting Officer believes that any redacted information does not require protection from public release, the issue will be resolved in accordance with paragraph 3.104-4(d) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract. (c) In performance of this contract, the Contractor assumes responsibility for protection of the confidentiality of Government records and must ensure that all work performed by its subcontractors shall be under the supervision of the Contractor or the Contractor's responsible employees. (d) Each officer or employee of the Contractor or any of its subcontractors to whom any Government record may be made available or disclosed must be notified in writing by the Contractor that information disclosed to such officer or employee can be used only for a purpose and to the extent authorized herein, and that further disclosure of any such information, by any means, for a purpose or to an extent unauthorized herein, may subject the offender to criminal sanctions imposed by 19 U.S.C. 641. That section provides, in pertinent part, that whoever knowingly converts to their use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys, or disposes of any record of the United States or whoever receives the same with intent to convert it to their use or gain, knowing it to have been converted, shall be guilty of a crime punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisoned up to ten years, or both.
