1.0 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES/GENERAL INFORMATION.  The contractor shall provide an Annual Release and Update Subscription (ARUS) software service
necessary to ensure that JCSE continuously maintains the current Version of WAVE software required to provide uninterrupted service to our
Unified customers.

1.1 Background.

Twisted Pair Solutions’ WAVE software technology enables and manages real-time, secure, group communications over the IP network, linking people
and devices. WAVE connects people who are using disparate and often incompatible communications technologies—such as two-way radios, personal
computers, cell phones, and IP phones—into a single, interoperable and manageable communications system via standards-based IP communications
technology. WAVE technology consists of software building blocks and development tools designed around a simple and elegant concept: convert all
forms of communication to IP packets, use the network to carry those packets between endpoints, and build distributed intelligence and
management capabilities at the network edge to connect the endpoints together. The company’s patent-pending technology converts communications
from individual users’ devices into group-level IP packets that can be forwarded to other devices and users. Once brought into a WAVE domain,
these interoperable communication sessions are subject to management and security controls, and may be bridged, recorded, joined into
conferences, or routed to devices outside of the system. WAVE is media agnostic with both voice and data media types currently supported. In
addition, status, presence and adaptive transport network management provide for rich collaboration among group communications participants. The
result is that groups of people can talk and share real-time data, with full control, regardless of the devices or systems used.  With audio
data converted into IP packets and streamed across the network, a new set of devices can directly link together and participate simply and
easily in critical communications.  Careful use of IP multicast, QoS, and transcoding technology minimizes network bandwidth requirements. All
of your devices, endpoints, and configurations are presented in clean, understandable, and manageable user interfaces.
Plus, since all WAVE systems are built from just a few modular components, you can configure them in an infinite number of ways to meet the
unique requirements of your organization.

1.2 Tasks.   The contractor shall provide ARUS Service to JCSE to ensure that the WAVE Software is current and secure. The contractor provides
the rights to upgrade purchased components to future releases of the licensed software in order to take advantage of product and technology
enhancements.

1.2.2 Delivery Method. The ARUS Service will be provided to JCSE via software download from the Twisted Pair Solutions Website. The software
will correspond to an existing license number containing the various services based upon product configuration.

2.0 SERVICES SUMMARY.  The Services Summary identifies the performance objectives and performance thresholds for all critical tasks associated
with providing the services outlined in this PWS.  This section contains only those items considered most important for mission accomplishment.
The performance objectives are those services/tasks required in the PWS.  The performance threshold briefly describes the minimum acceptable
levels of service required for each requirement.  The thresholds are critical to mission success.  The Government expects the Contractor to
perform at the acceptable levels throughout the life of the contract.
