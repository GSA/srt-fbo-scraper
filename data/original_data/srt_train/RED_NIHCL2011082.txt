                       INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS



   a. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

      INTRODUCTION

      The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and contents of proposals.  Special attention
      is directed to the requirements for technical and business proposals to be submitted in accordance with these instructions.

        1. Contract Type and General Clauses

           It is contemplated that a Fixed Price contract will be awarded.  Any resultant contract shall include the clauses applicable to the
           selected offerors organization and type of contract awarded as required by Public Law, Executive Order, or acquisition regulations in
           effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract.

        2. Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal

           The proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind your organization and must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the
           terms and conditions of this RFP.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the addressees, and marked as
           indicated in the Attachment entitled, PACKAGING AND DELIVERY OF PROPOSAL.  Proposals will be typewritten, paginated, reproduced on
           letter size paper and will be legible in all required copies. To expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for
           responding to the RFP should be placed in the following order:

           I.            COVER PAGE

                 Include RFP title, number, name of organization, identification of the proposal part, and indicate whether the proposal is an
                 original or a copy.

           II.   TECHNICAL PROPOSAL

                 It is recommended that the technical proposal consist of a cover page, a table of contents, and the information requested in the
                 Technical Proposal Instructions.

           III.  BUSINESS PROPOSAL

                 It is recommended that the business proposal consist of a cover page, a table of contents, and the information requested in the
                 Business Proposal Instructions.

        3. Separation of Technical and Business Proposals

           The proposal must be prepared in two parts:  a "Technical Proposal", and a "Business Proposal".  Each of the parts shall be separate
           and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the
           other.  The technical proposal may include direct cost and resources information, such as labor-hours and categories and applicable
           rates, materials, subcontracts, travel, etc., and associated costs so that the offerors understanding of the project may be
           evaluated, but should not include pricing data relating to individual salary information, indirect cost rates or amounts, fee amounts
           (if any)., and total costs.  The technical proposal should disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including,
           but not limited to, the requirements of the technical proposal instructions.
           NOTE: THE TECHNICAL PROPOSAL AND OTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO HOW THE OFFEROR INTENDS TO CONDUCT THE WORK AND SCOPE OF THIS
           SOLICITATION SHALL NOT EXCEED 50 SINGLE-SIDED PAGES.
           This page limitation does not include the cover sheet, abstract, table of contents, personnel, facilities, equipment and resources,
           other considerations, schedule, other support, cost information, and literature cited. Pages in excess of the limitation will be
           deleted and will neither be read nor evaluated. Each page of the technical proposal must be numbered sequentially. Offerors are
           encouraged to limit the overall size of the technical proposal, inclusive of appendices



        4. Evaluation of Proposals

           The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1, EVALUATION -
           COMMERCIAL ITEMS, in addition to the criterion set forth in Attachment Number 5 – Evaluation Criterion.

        5. Potential Award Without Discussions

           The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial
           prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.



        6. Use of the Metric System of Measurement

           It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to support the Federal transition to the metric system and to use the
           metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business related activities unless such use is impracticable or
           is likely to cause significant inefficiencies.

           The offeror is encouraged to prepare their proposal using either "Hard Metric," "Soft Metric," or "Dual Systems" of measurement.  The
           following definitions are provided for your information:

                 Hard Metric - The replacement of a standard inch/pound size with an accepted metric size when necessitated for a particular
                 purpose.  An example of size substitution might be: selling or packaging liquids by the liter instead of by the pint or quart
                 (as for soft drinks), or instead of by the gallon (as for gasoline).


                 Soft Metric - The result of a mathematical conversion of inch/pound measurements to metric equivalents when necessitated for a
                 particular purpose.  The physical characteristics are not changed.

                 Dual Systems - The use of both inch-pound and metric systems.  For example, an item is designed, produced, and described in inch-
                 pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison purposes.













        7. Privacy Act

           The Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information, the
           authority which authorizes the solicitation, whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, the principal purpose or purposes for
           which the information is intended to be used, the uses
           outside the agency which may be made of the information, and the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part
           of the requested information.

           The NIH is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Sec. 301(a)(7) of the Public
           Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.


           Providing the information requested is entirely voluntary. The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an
           accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.

           Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.

           In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals
           are requested to disclose their social security number.

           Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and
           efficient identification, referral, review and management of NIH contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is
           provided by Section 301 and Title IV of the PHS Act, as amended.

           The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes;

              a. to the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Office for auditing.
              b. to the Department of Justice as required for litigation.
              c. to respond to congressional inquiries.
              d. to qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees, for
                  opinions as a part of the review process.

      9.    Selection of Offerors

           a)    The acceptability of the technical portion of each contract proposal will be evaluated by a technical review committee.  The
                 committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity with the evaluation criteria of the RFP, utilizing point scores and
                 written critiques.  The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an offeror.

           b)    The business portion of each contract proposal will be subjected to a cost and price analysis, management analysis, etc.

           c)    If award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their
                 proposal (e.g., the relevance of an offerors past performance


                 information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or
                 to resolve minor or clerical errors.

           d)    If the Government intends to conduct discussions prior to awarding a contract-


              1. Communications will be held with offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from
                 being placed within the competitive range.  Such communications shall address adverse past performance information to which an
                 offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond.  Also, communications may be held with any other offerors whose exclusion
                 from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain.



                 Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal deficiencies or omissions that alter the technical or cost elements of
                 the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal, but may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of establishing
                 the competitive range.

                  2.   The Contracting Officer will, in concert with program staff, decide which proposals are in the competitive range.  The
                 competitive range will be comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals.  Oral or written discussions will be conducted
                 with all offerors in the competitive range.

                 While it is the Government’s policy to conduct discussions with all offerors in the competitive range, the Government reserves
                 the right, in special circumstances, to limit the number of proposals included in the competitive range to the greatest number
                 that will permit an efficient competition.  All aspects of the proposals are subject to discussions, including cost, technical
                 approach, past performance, and contractual terms and conditions.  At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror still in the
                 competitive range shall be given an opportunity to submit a written Final Proposal Revision (FPR) with the reservation of the
                 right to conduct finalization of details with the selected source in accordance with HHSAR 315.370.

           e)    The process described in FAR 15.101-1 will be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and
                 non-cost factors and to consider award to other than the lowest price offeror or other than the highest technically rated
                 offeror.  This process will take into consideration the results of the technical evaluation, the past performance evaluation (if
                 applicable) and the cost analysis.

           f)    The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all to the RFP.  In addition, the RFP
                 may be amended or canceled as necessary to meet the Government=s requirements.  Synopses of awards exceeding $25,000 will be
                 published in the Federal Business opportunities website.


      10.   Past Performance Information

           a)    Offerors shall submit the following information as part of their BUSINESS proposal.

                 A list of the last three ( 3)  contracts completed during the past five (5) years and ALL CONTRACTS currently being performed
                 that are similar in nature to the solicitation work scope.  Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal
                 Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial concerns.  Offerors may also submit past performance
                 information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform
                 major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.  For the purposes of
                 this solicitation, a major subcontract is defined as a subcontract that exceeds $500,000.





                 Include the following information for each contract or subcontract:
                 1.  Name of Contracting Organization

           b)    The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the offeror.


       11. Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference, FAR 52.252-1 (Feb 1998)
           This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given
           in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  The offeror is cautioned that the listed
           provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer.  In lieu of submitting
           the full text provision, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with
           its quotation or offer.  Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address:

    considered necessary to provide straightforward, concise delineation of the approach the offeror will use for accomplishing the work and how
    the project is to be managed and staffed.  Stating that the offeror understands and will comply with the technical requirements is not
    adequate.  Similarly, phrases such as standard procedures will be employed or a well-known techniques will be used are also inadequate.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--

(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 

(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) [_] Outside the United States.

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]

(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that—

(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—

(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror’s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Evaluation Criteria

A committee will evaluate proposals.  The Government reserves the right to make an award on the basis of the best value.  Evaluation of the
Offeror’s proposal is a three-step process.

      Step 1 – Mandatory Requirements Evaluation
      Step 2 – Technical Evaluation Process
               • Staff Qualifications
               • Technical Proposal Evaluation
               • Past Performance
      Step 3 – Cost Proposal Evaluation



STEP 1 – MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS EVALUATION

criteria in one clearly marked section of its proposal.

    • The resume(s) proposed for the persons assigned to  work under this award must be a licensed US Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)




Failure to adequately document compliance with the above listed mandatory requirements will result in the elimination of the Offeror’s proposal
from further consideration.  The proposal will be considered to be non-responsive, and the Offeror will be disqualified.  There are no points
related to these requirements – these requirements will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.

Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the variable evaluation criteria set forth below.  Those proposals determined to be technically
acceptable will be evaluated from a cost standpoint.  Award may be made based on initial proposals.  The Government reserves the right to hold
discussions if deemed necessary.

The following are the technical evaluation criteria, which will be used to evaluate proposals total possible points 100:

Step 2 – Technical Evaluation Process

Staff Qualifications (50 points)

The key personnel resume (s) presented within in the proposal will be rated on the following.  These must be competencies the person assigned to

Past Performance  (20 Points)

The Government shall evaluate the Offeror’s past performance and will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor
companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such
information is relevant to the acquisition.

The Government will conduct a performance risk evaluation based upon the past performance of the Offerors and their proposed major
subcontractors as it relates to the probability of successfully performing the solicitation requirements.

In conducting the performance risk evaluation, the Government may use data provided by the Offeror and data obtained from other sources
including the NIH Contractor Performance System.  The Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources that it considers
current and accurate.

The contractor has at least five (5) years of demonstrated experience in a government Clinical Research environment

Step 3 - Cost (10 Points)

All proposals determined to be technically acceptable will then be evaluated for cost according to the following parameters.

The prices offered in each proposal shall be totaled and compared.  Points shall be awarded according to the following formula:

Lowest price    X    # available points = cost points assigned
Offeror's price

The government reserves the right to deduct points if the proposed pricing method for "other expenses" is adjudged to be excessive.  This
deduction will not exceed a total of 10 points.  It is noted that points are merely a guide for source selection and the mathematical outcome is
not necessarily determinative of the awardee.

Award Criteria

Selection of an Offeror for award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against the evaluation factors specified above.  The factors in
order of importance are: Staff qualifications, Technical Approach, and Past Performance.

The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the scope of work as
set forth in the RFP.  The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully.  Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful
implementation of the requirements of the RFP.

In any case, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that Offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government
and provides for the most effective use of existing resources and technology resulting in the “best value” for the government.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation’s foremost federally funded biomedical research institution. NIH is comprised of twenty-
seven Institutes, Centers and Divisions and is an agency of the U.S, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).   The Clinical Center (CC)
includes the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (CRC) which is the on site hospital for the NIH campus, providing full support for
clinical research in inpatient and outpatient settings. The CRC facility is comprised of clinical, laboratory, and administrative space with 242
inpatient beds and 90 day-hospital stations.

The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH
