Mr. Allen Edgar
Contracting Officer


                                                                   ENCLOSURE 1

                                                                SCHEDULE OF PRICES

NOTE:  Insert unit prices proposed for each CLIN for each year.  The Total Price for each year will be determined by adding the individual CLIN
prices for each year in the tables.  The Total Contract  Price will be determined by summing the yearly Total Prices of the Base Year and all
Option Years.  CLIN = Contract Line Item Number; PWS = Performance Work Statement; NSP = Not Separately Priced; The Government reserves the
right to purchase, throughout the performance period, any combination of optional CLINs at the fixed monthly price in quantities that may be
less than 12 months.  The Offeror must provide optional CLIN personnel within 30 days of notice.

The CLIN descriptions are generic and provided for guidance only, including Government and Client site designations.  Offerors should provide
CLIN descriptions that are commensurate with their individual schedule descriptions and the nature of work to be performed.  Furthermore, should
Offerors deem it necessary to add additional CLINs or Labor Categories in a particular performance period, simply add/enumerate accordingly.
This is a quotation and the Government is interested in the sound business perspective and judgment of the Offerors.  The Government does not
guarantee that it will exercise each CLIN in a given period.

Offerors must provide a schedule in the price quotation that clearly details the breakdown of the proposed monthly prices by labor category,
labor hours, labor rates, materials, equipment, supplies, etc.  All other direct cost (ODC) items other than those provided in the schedule by
the Government must be separately priced, identified, and explained.  The Offeror must clearly identify other ODCs as exceptions to the Schedule
of Prices.  Any ODCs accepted by the Government will be clearly identified in the ODC line item text at award.  Those not included in the text
at award will be excluded by omission.

In addition to hard copy information, in order to expedite review of the quotation, Offerors must submit an electronic copy on CD in a format
compatible with the Microsoft Excel software program.  NARA utilizes these disks during the review of quoted prices for such things as math
checks, the use of correct escalation, and other evaluation procedures.  Offerors must include the formulas and factors used in calculation of
the data.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
DEVELOPMENT OF ARCHIVAL DESCRIPTION AND AUTHORITY SERVICES
FOR THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION (NARA)


1.0   BACKGROUND

As the nation’s record keeper, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) serves American democracy by safeguarding and preserving
the records of our Government, ensuring that the people can discover, use, and learn from this documentary heritage.  In support of this
mission, the Archival Research Catalog (ARC) makes available not only descriptive information about NARA’s vast archival holdings, but also
provides online access to an ever-growing number of digitized copies of materials previously accessible only onsite.

The digitized copies are not embedded within the ARC descriptions, but are maintained either on NARA-owned and operated servers or on digitizing
partners’ web sites.  The digitized copies include the following object types:

• ASCII Text
• Audio/Visual (RealMedia Video Stream)
• Audio/Visual File (AVI)
• Audio/Visual File (MOV)
• Audio/Visual File (MP4)
• Audio/Visual File (WMV)
• Image (BMP)
• Image (GIF)
• Image (JPG)
• MS Excel Spreadsheet
• Microsoft PowerPoint Document
• Microsoft Word Document
• Microsoft Write Document
• Portable Document File (PDF)
• Sound File (MP3)
• Sound File (WAV)
• World Wide Web Page

ARC descriptions may also link to electronic records available through NARA’s Access to Archival Data (AAD) system
<http://aad.archives.gov/aad/> or to external web pages that provide further information about the described materials.

NARA’s web site provides the public with access to approved archival descriptions and authority records via ARC Web.  ARC Web is available at
http://www.archives.gov/research/arc/.  ARC Web integrates with ARC Client/Server (C/S) through an intermediary program (Oracle Data
Integrator).   Twice a week this intermediary program exports authorized archival descriptions (both manually entered and imported) and linked
authority records from ARC C/S, de-normalizes the data, and transfers the data to ARC Web.  ARC C/S is the data entry (back-end) application
that enables NARA staff to enter new or update previously entered archival descriptions.  Following archival standards, staff organize and
describe archival holdings into five (5) hierarchical levels comprising seven (7) different types of description: record groups or collections,
unprocessed records[1], series, file units, and items or items (av).  When writing descriptions NARA staff use authority files (currently
maintained within ARC C/S) to apply consistent data values for archival description access points and code lists and to provide contextual
information about the holdings.

Although the majority of NARA staff manually enter archival descriptions in ARC C/S, a third and independent component of the system, the ARC
Import Tool, allows for the bulk import of archival descriptions in XML format.  The ARC Import Tool can upload XML descriptions as either
‘works in progress’ that require formal review and approval or as ‘approved’ for the ARC Web transfer.  Archival descriptions imported in this
manner are either provided by NARA’s digitizing partners or by NARA program units who previously wrote the descriptions in a variety of non-
ARC/non-standardized formats (e.g., MS Excel, MS Word, etc.).

Statistics

ARC currently contains approximately 4.5 million archival descriptions, broken down as follows:

• 520 record groups
• 2,300 collections
• 107,000 series
• 3.9 million file units
• 293,000 items/items (AV)

ARC contains approximately 8.9 million authority records, broken down as follows:

• Specific Records Types:  8,900
• Topical Subjects: 23,000
• Persons: 4.9 million
• Organizations
         o Non-Federal Organizations 1.8 million
         o Non-Federal Meetings: 222,000
         o Federal Organizations: 984,000
• Geographic Locations:  1 million
• Non-standard headings:  14,700

On average, 75,000 archival descriptions are added to ARC C/S each week.  This includes both manually entered descriptions as well as XML
descriptions uploaded via the ARC Import Tool.





2.0   OBJECTIVES



2.1   Development of the Archival Description and Authority Services

NARA has outgrown the existing ARC C/S system and requires a more robust solution that is capable of scaling to support at least 250 million
archival descriptions with links to upwards of 500 million digital copies over the next 4-7 years. The objective of this Performance Work
Statement (PWS) is to replace the current ARC C/S thick-client application with two (2) web-based, thin-client services - one for archival
descriptions and one for authorities.  The selected Vendor will develop and implement the system in 2 phases.  The first phase will be the
concept phase and the second phase will be the development phase.  During the concept phase, the vendor will analyze the requirements provided
as part of this PWS and will provide the Government with a recommendation as to the best functional and technical approach to develop the
system.  Based on that recommendation, the Government will make a decision as to whether it will go forward with the second phase of the
project.

2.2   The current ARC C/S application design is based on a proprietary Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) product known as Online Library System
(OLIB) and is owned by OCLC.  The ARC OLIB physical schema is owned by and remains the property of OCLC.  No efforts can be made to reverse
engineer the ARC C/S application. The custom ARC Web source code and resulting executable code are the property of the U.S. Government and its
assignees.  The Vendor may have full access to this code during the development of the new archival description and authority services.


3.0   Scope

The Contractor must provide personnel, resources, and facilities as appropriate to provide efficient and cost effective development and support
services for NARA’s Description and Authority Tools as described and/or referenced below.


3.1   Service Specifications


3.1.1    General Requirements

3.1.1.1  Service-Oriented Architecture
From NARA’s perspective, a service is an information technology (IT) representation of a business functionality that has a well-defined business
interface. A business interface is a business-oriented view of a service expressed so that a system developer, system analyst, or information
technologist can understand.  A service is self-contained, i.e. it can exist in loose coupling with other services for execution in a computing
environment. A loosely coupled service can be executed on different computers with disparate operating systems.

3.1.1.2 The vendor shall categorize and decompose as necessary and deliver for NARA’s approval, business/functional requirements separated from
infrastructure requirements that support the use and management of computer resources.

3.1.1.3 The vendor must deliver a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) system architecture development and execution plan before any other
significant detailed design is done.

3.1.1.4 Because NARA does not currently have a SOA-based environment, the system architecture and development plan must

 o Establish requirements for SOA infrastructure service support, and


 o Describe how the following will be accomplished and what tool(s) will be used:

      ▪ Transportation of messages among various components of a service and among various services (e.g. an enterprise service bus)


      ▪ Tracking of all the available business services – description and rules for usage of every service within the SOA environment (e.g.
        SOA registry).


      ▪ Storage of the source code and the linking information used to build all the applications using business and infrastructure services
        that run in the operational environment (e.g. SOA repository).


      ▪ Enforcement of policies (e.g. service broker).


      ▪ Business Process Management (BPM) – modeling, rules engines, workflow, process monitoring and deployment (e.g. BPM tools).


      ▪ Measurement of service levels both in terms of availability and response time of an end-to-end process (e.g. business activity
        monitoring tools).

3.1.1.5 The system architecture and development plan must also:


 o Identify business process threads, based on business and infrastructure requirements, in order to determine system capabilities.  Because a
   business process may follow a path from a set of possible paths to different levels, it is required that no more than three level of process
   threads be analyzed for the system architecture.


 o Explain how the vendor will transform required system capabilities into reusable SOA services (business, infrastructure) and service families.
   The development of a SOA service is dependent upon a concept that separates business logic from presentation and data management logic. All
   SOA services including the service that implements the business logic must be accessible externally via well-defined interfaces.

 o Describe architecture-level business orchestrations and specify the types of tools that will facilitate such orchestrations.  Every business
   has process flows, be they implicit or explicit. Under the SOA-approach, business services should strung together to establish business
   processes – also known as orchestration of end-to-end business process.

 o Describe sourcing strategy for required SOA services, including purchasing COTS products.

 o Describe and document data migration plans.

3.1.2 Data Service

The business services for the proposed system will have to access existing data. Under the SOA approach, the selected vendor must provide a Data
Service Plan describing how existing data will be available via a data service or a set of data services where data is not tightly coupled to a
specific application but is available as a reusable resource.


3.2   Specific Archival Description and Authority Services’ Requirements

The selected vendor shall develop discrete descriptive and authority services designed for reuse in multiple business contexts and to interact
with other services and applications to support NARA’s business needs.  As specified in the individual specification documents, the description
service will need to interface with the following NARA systems:

     a. Electronic Records Archives system (ERA)


     b. Holdings Management System (HMS)


     c. Online Public Access system (OPA)


     d. Authority service to be developed as part of this PWS


The authority service will need to interface with the following NARA systems:


     a. Archival Description service to be developed as part of this PWS


     b. Online Public Access system (OPA)

The requirements are detailed in the following documents:

3.2.1 Description Tool Requirements Specifications (Appendix A)

3.2.2 Authority Tool Requirements Specifications (Appendix B)

3.2.3       Lifecycle Data Standards Requirement Guide (LCDRG) (Appendix C)

3.2.4 Proposed Changes and Additions to the LCDRG (Appendix D)

3.2.5 Logical Data Model (Appendix E)

3.2.6       In addition, NARA has created a logical data model that depicts the entities, attributes and relationships of archival description
and authority data.  The model is based on the 'as is' ARC C/S system, but has been updated to account for new attributes and relationships not
currently captured in ARC C/S, but reflected in the requirements documents referenced in this section of the PWS.   The logical model will need
to be updated to show the system boundaries between the archival description and authority services since both reside in the same system now but
will be implemented as two separate services.  Upon contract award, the contractor and NARA will conduct working group meetings to review and
finalize the description and authority service requirements documents and to make any final changes required to the logical data model.


3.3   General IT Standards

The Contractor shall adhere to the following NARA and Federal Government IT standards when developing the description and authority services.
(Note: There are often ‘third party’ requirements on software for public use (i.e., Section 508 Handicap Accessibility) which require the
software producer to make choices between features and accessibility.

3.3.1 NARA 804: Information Technology Systems Security

3.3.2 FIPS SP 800-52: Security Controls

3.3.3 NARA 805: Systems Life Cycle Development Standards

3.3.4 NARA’s Enterprise Architecture (TRM)

3.3.5 NARA’s Enterprise Architecture Profile

3.3.6 Section 508 – Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act

10.1  Submission of Deliverables.

Deliverables must be submitted to the COR for inspection, review and acceptance.  Formal acceptance occurs upon COR signature.  The deliverables
become the property of the U.S. Government.  The Government must provide comments on each deliverable within ten (10) workdays of receipt.  The
Contractor must incorporate the Government’s comments within 10-days after receipt of Government comments.  In the event of rejection of any
deliverable, the Contractor must be notified in writing by the Government of the specific reasons why the deliverable is unsatisfactory.  The
Contractor must return a revised document within ten (10) workdays to the COR.


10.2  Deliverable Versions.

The Contractor must provide documents in draft and final versions.  All versions must be delivered by e-mail or other appropriate electronic
format.  In an effort to reduce the use of paper, no hard copies will be accepted as a deliverable for this task order.

10.3  Deliverable Data Requirements.

All documents shall be on Contractor letterhead, dated with the current date of submission, and state the contract title and contract number.
All daily, monthly, and annual reports shall be submitted electronically unless there’s an unusual circumstance that prevents an electronic
submission.

Standards of Acceptable Performance:  All deliverables are provided on-time and in an acceptable format. Deliverables are of sufficient high
quality that they require infrequent revision, are generally well written, thoroughly researched, and comply with NARA Style Guide and plain
language standards.

1.  INTRODUCTION

A.  Quality Assurance is based on the premise that the Offeror, and not the government, is responsible for management and quality control
actions to meet the terms of the Contract, and the government is responsible for assuring that the Offeror’s quality control efforts are
effective.  The Offeror, in its QC Plan (to be approved by the government), shall state the method of surveillance and the schedule of
surveillance for monitoring the entirety of the Contract’s performance, including the SLAs in the PRS.

B.  The Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) and/or his/her designated quality monitor(s) will monitor how the Offeror executes its QC
Plan, and will perform spot inspections of QC outcomes on an ad-hoc basis as deemed necessary.  The Offeror shall notify the COR of all of its
Quality Inspections, and provide results of all of its Quality Inspections to the COR within three (3) business days from the date of the
inspection.

C.  Notice to the COR of Quality Inspections shall be provided in order to allow the COR and/or his / her designated quality monitor(s) the
opportunity to be present during the inspections.  In addition, the Offeror shall provide the government all information necessary for the
government personnel to perform their quality assurance activities.

2.  APPLICABILITY OF THE FAR

FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items (MAR 2009), and its Alternate 1 (OCT 2008) for a time-and-material contract, as
well as all other rights and remedies available to the government.

3.  OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE SURVEILLANCE

A.  The PRS provides for objective, scheduled surveillance of contract performance.  Non-conformance will result in a Contract Discrepancy
Report (CDR) being issued by the COR, and reductions in price, if applicable.  The absence of any contract requirement from the PRS does not
detract from its enforceability, nor limit the rights or remedies of the government under any other provisions of the requirement.

B.  Subjective surveillance may also be utilized.  Subjective surveillance includes customer feedback/Satisfaction Survey and written
perceptions of the quality of performance (including the quality of deliverables) in meeting all contrcat requirements.  All remedies for non-
conformance are applicable to subjective, as well as objective, surveillance.

C.  The COR will maintain all documentation in the COR file, which will become part of the contract file.

 4.  OFFEROR NOTIFICATION OF DEFECTS

A.  Any non-conformance with contract requirements is a “defect”.  Defects include the Offeror’s failure to perform a required task, the
Offeror’s failure to take corrective action, less-than-satisfactory performance, and less-than-satisfactory customer perceptions.

B.  A Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) will be issued by the COR to the Offeror for all defects.  The CDR will be an official record of the
defect, and will state a recommended action to the Contracting Officer, including any applicable price reductions.

C.  The Offeror will be provided a copy of the CDR within five (5) business days from the noted defect, and will be provided three (3) business
days to respond.  After the COR evaluates the Offeror’s response, the COR will forward to the Contracting Officer any CDR requiring further
action (price reduction, cure notice, etc.).  Any portion of the contract, or the entirety of the contract, is subject to surveillance,
remedies, and ultimately, termination.

D.  The remedies in the PRS are based on a points value.  However, because the government is looking at the totality of the Offeror’s
performance under the RFQ, including subjective measures, there is no minimum number of points that will trigger the government issuing any
appropriate remedy.

E.  If the CDR recommends a price reduction, the date on which the defect was noted, not the date of the CDR, will determine for what invoice
period there will be a price reduction.

F.  Before an invoice can be paid in full, a determination by the COR must first be made that satisfactory services have been received.  For
months in which there have been price reductions, the Offeror shall adjust its invoice(s) accordingly.

5.  REVISIONS

Any revisions made to the QASP, the PRS, or the QA items will be the responsibility of the COR and the Contracting Officer, and notice will be
provided to the Offeror at least thirty (30) days prior to the revision taking effect.

6.  PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY (PRS).

A.  Quality Assurance is based on the premise that the Offeror, and not the government, is responsible for management and quality control
actions to meet the terms of the contract, and the government is responsible for assuring that the Offeror’s quality control efforts are
effective.  The Offeror, in its QC Plan (to be approved by the government), shall state the method of surveillance and the schedule of
surveillance for monitoring the entire performance of this contract, including the QA items herein.

B.  The Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) and/or his/her designated quality monitor(s) will monitor how the Offeror executes its QC
Plan, and will perform spot inspections of QC outcomes on an ad-hoc basis as deemed necessary.  The Offeror shall notify the COR of all of its
Quality Inspections, and provide the results of all of its Quality Inspections to the COR within ten (10) business days from the date of the
inspection.

C.  Ratings:  Targets for each of the QA items are provided in the attached Performance Requirement Summary; the COR will assign a Satisfactory
or Unsatisfactory rating for each of the five (5) identified QA items.  Two or more “Unsatisfactory” ratings during an evaluation period will be
recorded as “Unsatisfactory” performance. Unsatisfactory performance will result in the following actions:

      NARA will issue a formal notification letter to the Offeror’s Program Manager stating the defects.  The Government will allow 10-days for
      formal response and the Offerors suggested steps to correct or address contract performance.


      Performance resulting in multiple “Unsatisfactory” in any single 12-month performance period, depending on the severity of the
      discrepancies, and the impact to Government operations, may result deductions commensurate to the impact.


      Consecutive overall “Unsatisfactory” performance ratings will result in NARA will issuing a cure notice to the Offeror and may result in
      deductions from the Contract.


      Performance ratings for each performance period will be maintained in the Contract file but will not against future performance periods.
      However, any remedy (in the QASP/PRS and/or FAR) to which the government is entitled during one performance period may carry over to the
      next performance period for resolution, if the government deems it necessary.
      Overall Performance ratings will be maintained and used as part of the overall Contract performance rating reported to Government Past
      Performance Websites.


      Payment deductions for unacceptable performance will be limited to a per incident amount of 10% of the daily costs of the deliverable and
      may include the Government withholding up to 40% payments until successful completion of a task/milestone.  Successive months of
      unsatisfactory performance for any PRS item or other contract requirement not included in the performance requirement summary may result in
      other appropriate action by the CO in accordance with other terms and conditions of this contract, including Termination for Default.

D.  The government is not limited to the remedies in C, above, to address Offeror performance, and may use as many remedies simultaneously as it
deems necessary.

** Defects Definitions:

Critical - Catastrophic defect that causes total failure of the software or unrecoverable data loss. There is no work around. In general, a
severity 1 defect would prevent the product from being released. Example: defects that cause the system to crash, corrupt data files, or
completely disrupt service.

High - Defect results in severely impaired functionality. A work around may exist but its use is unsatisfactory. In general, you would not
release the product with such a defect.  Example:  A database or web error occurs when a user initiates a certain action in the system and
you’re able to click through the error and continue working.

Moderate - Defect causes failure of non-critical aspects of the system. There is a reasonably satisfactory work around. The product may be
released if the defect is documented, but the existence of the defect may cause customer dissatisfaction. Example: a user-generated report is
not recognizing an option correctly, but if a filter is set, the report can be generated with the proper output.

Low - Defect of minor significance. A work around exists or, if not, the impairment is slight. Generally, the product could be released and most
customers would be unaware of the defect's existence or only slightly dissatisfied. Example: A button or button set is slightly off center on a
data screen, or the problem is purely cosmetic and not easily recognizable.

                                                                   ENCLOSURE 3

                                                               TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.0   ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)

    a.      The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that:


           i.  The Offeror’s objectivity and judgment are not biased because of its present, or currently planned interests, (financial,
           contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to work under this purchase order;


           ii.  The Offeror does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage by virtue of its access to non-public information regarding the
           Government’s program plans and actual or anticipated resources; and


           iii.  The Offeror does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage by virtue of its access to proprietary information belonging to
           others.


    b.      In order to preclude an organizational conflict of interest, the Offeror will not be permitted to bid upon or otherwise become a
    Offeror or subcontractor (except where the Offeror is a sole source) for any other IT related contract awarded by NARA during the term of
    this IT support contract (or for any particular IT related procurement action, which in this case primarily involves requirements definition,
    the Offeror was involved in during this IT support contract period but awarded after the expiration of this IT support contract) except in
    the following circumstances.

    c.      Prior to working on a particular IT project per the terms of the PWS that might result in a NARA IT procurement (defined as any
    procurement that is part of the NARA IT Environment even if only tangentially related), the Offeror may request to be allowed to bid upon, as
    Offeror or subcontractor, or otherwise perform work on another NARA IT contract.  At the CO's discretion, following consultation with the
    COR, the Offeror may receive permission to bid or perform such work. If the Contracting Officer determines that the particular IT project
    requires the Offeror’s performance or the Offeror has already performed more than negligible work on that IT project, then the Contracting
    Officer will not approve the Offeror’s request.  If the IT project does not require the Offeror’s performance and no work or negligible work
    has been performed, the Contracting Officer may approve the Offeror’s request to bid upon or perform work on another NARA contract. The
    Offeror(s) awarded this contract are explicitly prohibited from providing any management, design, development, integration, training,
    operations, or maintenance tasks or contract with any NARA entity for the completion of such tasks unless the Offeror has received prior
    approval by the Contracting Officer.

    d.      It is understood that the Offeror, including all subcontractors and consultants, shall comply with the provisions of Federal
    Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. The Offeror must submit a Mitigation Plan as to how it
    proposes to handle a Conflict of Interest, which will be addressed prior to award.  In general, the Mitigation Plan will include a firewall
    arrangement so that the Offeror will not obtain unfair access to nonpublic information. The Mitigation Plan must provide for the
    organizational, physical and electronic separation of personnel supporting NARA from the Offeror’s other business units or from the proposing
    unit.  Should the Offeror have an existing order or contract with NARA, it is in NARA's sole discretion to allow the Offeror to participate
    in the competition for this award as the size and complexity of the existing order or contract may preclude the Offeror from providing viable
    service to NARA, per the terms of this PWS, in an environment with a properly executed firewall in place.  Among other things, the Mitigation
    Plan must address: (1) the support the Offeror is providing agencies supported by NARA, (2) types of non-IT related services to NARA
    customers, (3) a continuous education program, (4) nondisclosure agreements, (5) document control, and (6) audits at regular intervals.  The
    Offeror must immediately notify NARA of any NARA acquisitions on which the Offeror plans to submit a quotation.  As part of the Mitigation
    Plan, and semi-annually throughout contract performance, the Offeror must submit to NARA a complete updated listing of on-going contracts it
    has with NARA and any known future NARA procurements in which the Offeror is interested.

    e.      If the Contractor, in the performance of this contract, obtains access to information such as plans, policies, reports, studies,
    financial plans, or data which has not been released or otherwise made available to the public, the Contractor agrees that without prior
    written approval of the Contracting Officer, it will not:  (a) use such information for any private purposes unless the information has been
    released or otherwise made available to the public, (b) compete for work based on such information for a period of one year after the
    completion of this contract, or until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public, whichever occurs first, (c)
    submit an unsolicited quotation to the Government which is based on such information until one (1) year after such information is released or
    otherwise made available to the public, or (d) release such information unless such information has previously been released or otherwise
    made available to the public by the Government.

    f.      If, under this contract, the Contractor gains access to proprietary or source selection information of other companies in performing
    advisory assistance services for the Government, the Contractor agrees to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure and to
    refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.  A separate agreement will be entered into
    between the Offeror and the company whose proprietary information is the subject of this restriction.  A copy of this agreement must be
    provided to the Offeror Officer.

    g.      The Offeror will include this or substantially the same clause, including this paragraph, in consulting agreements and subcontracts
    of all tiers.  The terms “contract,” “Offeror,” and “Contracting Officer” will be appropriately modified to preserve the Government’s rights.



    h.      The Offeror represents that is has disclosed to the Contracting Officer, prior to award, all facts relevant to the existence of
    organizational conflict of interest as that term is used in FAR Subpart 9.5.  The Offeror represents that if it discovers any organizational
    conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest after award, a prompt and full disclosure must be made in writing to the Contracting
    Officer.  This disclosure must include a description of the action the Offeror has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid or mitigate
    such conflicts.

    i.      Prior to Contract modification, when the work statement is changed to add new work or the period of performance is significantly
    increased, the Contracting Officer will request and the Offeror is required to submit either an organizational conflict of interest
    disclosure or an update of the previously submitted disclosure or representation.


2.0   KEY PERSONNEL

   a. The Contractor agrees to assign to the Contract the key personnel whose resumes were submitted as required by Enclosure 2 [see PWS 4.1.8]
      to fill the requirements of the Contract.  No substitution or addition of personnel will be made except in accordance with this clause.


   b. The Contractor agrees that during the first 12 months of the Contract period, no personnel substitutions will be permitted, unless such
      substitutions are necessitated by an individual’s sudden illness, death, or termination of employment.  In any of these events, the
      Contractor must promptly notify the Contracting Officer/COR and provide the information required by paragraph (d) below.


   c. If key personnel, for whatever reason, become unavailable for work under this Contract for a continuous period exceeding thirty (30)
      working days, or are expected to devote substantially less effort to the work than indicated in its Quotation, the Contractor must propose
      a substitution of such personnel, in accordance with paragraph (d) below.


   d. All proposed key personnel substitutions must be submitted, in writing, to the Contracting Officer/COR at least fifteen (15) days prior to
      the proposed substitution.  Each request must provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitution,
      a complete resume for the proposed substitute and any other information required by the Contracting Officer to approve or disapprove the
      proposed substitution(s). Resumes for key personnel substitutions must be submitted in Contractor format. All proposed substitutes (no
      matter when they are proposed during the performance period) must have qualifications that are equal to or higher than the qualifications
      of the person being replaced.


   e. In the event the Contractor designates additional key personnel as deemed appropriate for the requirement, the Contractor must submit to
      the Contracting Officer for approval the information required in paragraph (d) above.


   f. The Contracting Officer will evaluate requests for substitution and addition of personnel and promptly notify the Contractor, in writing,
      whether a request is approved or disapproved.


   g. If the Contracting Officer determines that suitable and timely replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated, or have
      otherwise become unavailable to perform under the Contract is not reasonably forthcoming, or that a resultant reduction of productive
      effort would impair the successful completion of the Contract, the Contract may be terminated by the Contracting Officer for default or for
      the convenience of the Government, as appropriate.  Alternatively, at the Contracting Officer’s discretion, if the Contracting Officer
      finds the Contractor to be at fault for the condition, she may equitably adjust (downward) the Contract price to compensate the Government
      for any delay, loss or damage as a result of the Contractor’s action.

3.0   STANDARDS OF CONDUCT

  a.  The Offeror will be responsible for maintaining satisfactory standards of employee competency, conduct, appearance, and integrity. The
     Offeror is also responsible for ensuring that its employees and those of its subcontractor(s) do not disturb papers on desks, open desk
     drawers or cabinets, use Government telephones, except as authorized, or otherwise jeopardize the security and the privacy of Government
     employees, its clientele, and the contents and property of the federal building(s) in which the Contract work is performed. Each employee
     or supervisor of the Offeror is expected to adhere to standards of behavior that reflect credit on themselves, their employer, and the
     Federal Government.

  b.  The Offeror will be responsible for taking such disciplinary action, including suspension without pay or removal from the worksite, with
     respect to its employees, as may be necessary to enforce those standards.


  c.  Where applicable, the requirements of this clause must be expressly incorporated into subcontract(s) and must be applicable to all
     subcontractor employees who may perform recurring services or work at the federal building and grounds of this Contract.


  d.  The Government retains the right to permanently remove any employee of the Offeror from performing duties assigned under this Contract at
     the federal building should the employee’s performance so warrant. The Government will request the Offeror to immediately remove any
     employee of the Offeror from the federal building/work-site should it be determined by the Contracting Officer that the individual employee
     of the Offeror is “unsuitable” for security reasons or for otherwise being found to be unfit for performing his assigned duty at a federal
     building.  The following areas (not all-inclusive) are considered justification for requesting the Offeror to immediately remove an
     employee from a federal building/work site:


           (i) Neglect of assigned duty and refusing to render assistance or cooperate in upholding the integrity of the security programs at
            the worksite;
           (ii) Falsification or unlawful concealment, removal, mutilation, or destruction of any official documents or records, or concealment
            of material facts by willful omissions from official documents or records;

            participation in disruptive activities which interfere with the normal and efficient operations of the Government;
           (iv) Theft, vandalism, immoral conduct, or any other criminal actions;

           (vi) Improper use of official authority or credentials, as a supervisor or employee of the Offeror;
           (vii) Violation of Agency and Offeror security procedures and regulations; and
           (viii) Violation of the rules and regulations governing federal public buildings and grounds, set forth in 41 CFR Part 102-74,
           Subpart C, Conduct on Federal Property.


   e. Following a recommendation from an agency program official or security officer, the Contracting Officer will make all determinations
     regarding the removal of any employee of the Contractor from and denial/termination of clearance and access to the federal building
     worksite for non-performance, misconduct, or failure to abide by all laws and regulations. The Contracting Officer will verbally inform the
     Offeror about the employee, followed by a written confirmation or determination. Specific reasons for the removal of an employee will be
     provided to the Offeror in writing. In the event of a dispute, the Contracting Officer will make a final determination.


  f.  Upon a determination of the Government that an employee of the Offeror be removed from or denied access to a federal building worksite,
     the employee’s clearance and access to the federal building must be immediately revoked or otherwise terminated. Furthermore, if
     applicable, the building pass and/or other access device(s) previously given to the employee must be immediately surrendered, returned, or
     delivered to the security officer of the federal building.


  g.  During the course of this contract, the Offeror may come into contact with data files subject to the Privacy Act.  If this situation
     occurs, Privacy Act data must conform to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended.  The Offeror also may come into contact with
     confidential documents and confidential information about documents and proposed Federal Agency actions. The Offeror, including Offeror’s
     personnel, Subcontractors, and consultants must not divulge or release data or information developed or obtained in performance of this
     task except to authorized Government personnel or upon written approval of the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor must not use, disclose,
     or reproduce proprietary data, which bears a restrictive legend, other than as required in the performance of this task.  The limitations
     above do not apply to data or information that has been made public by the Government.

for returning all Government identification, building passes, keys, and other Government property issued to that employee. Failure on the part
of the Offeror may result in the Offeror's liability for all costs associated with correcting the resultant breech in building security.

requirement.  The Government may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and grant temporary access to employees of the Offeror and its
subcontractors.  However, the granting of temporary access to any such employee will not be considered as assurance that full suitability
determination will follow as a result or condition thereof. The granting of either temporary or full access will in no way prevent, preclude, or
bar the withdrawal or termination of any such suitability determination by the Government as deemed necessary to protect facilities.

b.    Unless otherwise specified, the Offeror must submit to the COR, as soon as possible, but not later than ten (10) working days before

NARA SECURITY OF SYSTEMS HANDLING AND PROTECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION                                (JAN 2010)

(a) Applicability
This clause applies to all personally identifiable information, as defined in Section B, regardless of the medium in which it is found and
includes paper records.

(b)  Definitions.  As used in this clause:
“Breach” means the loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or any similar situation
where persons other than authorized users, and for other than authorized purpose, have access or potential access to personally identifiable
information, in usable form whether physical or electronic.
“Personally identifiable information (PII)” means any information that permits the identity of an individual to be directly or indirectly
inferred, including any other information that is linked or linkable to that individual regardless of whether the individual is a citizen of the
United States, legal permanent resident, or a visitor to the United States.  Examples of PII include the following:
        1) Name.
        2) Date of birth.
        3) Mailing address.
        4) Telephone number.
        5) Social Security Number.
        6) Email address.
        7) Zip code.
        8) Account numbers.
        9) Certificate/license numbers.
       10) Vehicle identifiers including license plates.
       11) Uniform resource locators (URLs).
       12) Internet protocol addresses.
       13) Biometric identifiers (e.g., fingerprints).
       14) Photographic facial images.
       15) Any other unique identifying number or characteristic.
       16) Any information where it is reasonably foreseeable that the information will be linked with other information to identify the
           individual.

“Sensitive personally identifiable information (sensitive PII)” means a subset of PII, which if lost, compromised or disclosed without
authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual.
      (1)  Complete social security numbers, alien registration numbers (A-number) and biometric identifiers (such as fingerprint, voiceprint,
or iris scan) are considered sensitive PII even if they are not coupled with additional PII.
      (2)  Additional examples include any grouping of information that contains an individual’s name or other unique identifier plus one or
more of the following elements:
      (i)  Driver’s license number, passport number, or
      truncated social security number (such as last 4 digits);
      (ii)  Date of birth (month, day, and year);
      (iii)  Citizenship or immigration status;
      (iv)  Financial information such as account numbers or
      electronic funds transfer information;
      (v)  Medical information; and/or
      (vi)  System authentication information such as
      mother’s maiden name, account passwords or
      personal identification numbers.
      (3)  Other PII may be “sensitive” depending on its context, such as a list of employees with less than satisfactory performance ratings or
an unlisted home address or phone number.  In contrast, a business card or public telephone directory of agency employees contains PII but it is
not sensitive.

(c)  Data Security.

in order to perform their official duties under this contract.
      (2)  The Contractor, Contractor employees, and subcontractors must physically or electronically secure sensitive PII when not in use and/or
under the control of an authorized individual, and when in transit to prevent unauthorized access or loss.

      (3)  When sensitive PII is no longer needed or required to be retained under applicable Government records retention policies, it must be
destroyed, as specified in the contract, or if not specified in the contract, through means that will make the sensitive PII irretrievable.
      (4)  The Contractor shall only use sensitive PII obtained under this contract for purposes of the contract; it shall not be disclosed,
released, disseminated, or published without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer.
      (5)  If it is established elsewhere in this contract that information to be utilized under this contract, or a portion thereof, is subject

implementing regulations and policies, with respect to systems of records determined to be subject to the Privacy Act.
      (6)  At expiration or termination of this contract, the Contractor shall turn over all sensitive PII obtained under the contract that is in
its possession.

                                                           EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


The Offeror’s technical quotation requirements described in the solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with FAR PART 12 and 13 using the
following evaluation factors.  Offeror selection will be based on the best overall value to the Government.

TECHNICAL FACTORS

Technical Understanding and Management and Quality Control are of equal relative importance and are of greater relative importance than all
other technical factors.  Personnel and Relevant Past Performance are considered of equal relative importance.  All technical factors when
combined are significantly more important than cost.


A.   Technical Understanding and Approach.  The Government will assess the Offeror's demonstrated technical knowledge and competence with regard
to the Government’s requirements and program objectives; understanding of, and approach to the work that the Offeror would have to perform under
the prospective order.  The Government will assess whether the Offeror exhibits adequate techniques and approaches to meet task order needs and
provide effective and efficient support services.

B.    Management and Quality Control.  The Government will assess the management approach and procedures for managing and controlling the
performance of the tasks identified in the PWS.  The Government will also assess whether the Offeror exhibits adequate management capability and
effective quality control procedures to accomplish the overall objectives of this order by assessing the Offeror’s draft quality control plan.

C.    Personnel.  The Government will assess the suitability of the overall staffing approach.  All personnel assigned must be technically
qualified, have broad experience levels, and possess comprehensive managerial or technical backgrounds in the various disciplines described.

D.    Relevant Past Performance.  The Offeror will be evaluated to assess the demonstrated quality of performance on similar work, to include
the ability to control the quality and cost of work, timeliness of performance, and effectiveness at accomplishing the goals of previous work.

II.   PRICE

All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  Selection of the firm to
perform this order will be based on NARA’s assessment of the best overall value to the Government.


                                                                   Enclosure 7
