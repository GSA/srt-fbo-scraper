Background/History

Currently, the United States Mint's Sales and Marketing systems are supported by the Integrated Retail Information System (IRIS). IRIS is comprised of systems, applications, and business processes, all in constant communication in order to effectively support the United States Mint sales function for numismatists and the general public. Both the Order Management System and e-commerce website are part of the IRIS environment. The Order Management System was implemented in 2001. Also in 2001, a real-time e-commerce site was launched. While the Order Management System was "state of the art" at the time of implementation, minimal upgrades have occurred in the preceding years. In order to adopt standard industry processes for e-commerce and order management functions, it is imperative for the United States Mint to implement a solution with minimal configuration and automated business rules that enforce best practices. It is also important that the system scale to support new functionality required for the United States Mint to remain up to date and competitive with the marketplace.

Additionally, the United States Mints e-commerce website cannot handle high order volumes during large product launches. The United States Mint requires that the SAAS solution be able to handle high order volumes without any performance degradation to the e-commerce website Both the Order Management and e-commerce website are integrated with third party systems including a Warehouse Management, a Financial Management System and Point of Sale System. The SaaS solution must integrate seamlessly with all supporting IRIS systems ensuring the United States Mints end-to-end Sales and Marketing functions are executed efficiently.

"Software-As-A-Service" Defined

Due to the evolving landscape of cloud computing, a number of definitions from numerous sources have been defined over the last several years. As articulated by the National Institute for Standards and Technology: "Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction." As this definition has a broad scope and encompasses a wide range of possible service models, the United States Mint is looking to leverage a Cloud Software as a Service. SaaS is defined by the National Institute for Standards and Technology as follows: "The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings." While Cloud computing may provide the opportunity to build applications on top of an outsourced Cloud computing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, the United States Mint is looking for a pre-developed, proven SaaS solution with e-commerce and OMS capabilities holistically owned and operated by a single enterprise.

Federal Procurement Process

Although the United States Mint is a bureau of the Department of the Treasury, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 5136, provisions of law governing the procurement or public contracts are not applicable to the procurement of goods or services that are necessary for carrying out United States Mint programs and operations. The intent and effect of the provision is to afford the United States Mint the flexibility to operate in a business-like fashion. Nonetheless, many of the same fundamental principles of federal procurement that apply to other federal agencies still apply to procurements conducted at the United States Mint and accordingly United States Mint contracts must include certain provisions that may not be familiar to venders who do not typically do business with the government. In addition, some provisions that may be standard in commercial contracts (such as provisions requiring the United States Mint to indemnify the vendor, or provisions requiring the United States Mint to submit to the jurisdiction of any state court) are unsuitable for United States Mint contracts.
