Government Product/Service Accessibility Template for Application/Operating System Software


Summary

       • Column one includes all the Sections of the Standard that may apply to any deliverable.  The total number of provisions within each
         Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses.
       • Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these may not be
         features of the vendor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable
         includes additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.
       • Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the
         deliverable.
       • Column four is a summary of the vendor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the
         Standard.
       • Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected
         applicable provisions and actual product features.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.

    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in
      providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also
      an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.

Government Product Accessibility Template for Software Maintenance Services


Summary

       • Column one involves consideration of all the Sections of the Standard that might apply to any deliverable.  The total number of
         provisions within each Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses.
       • Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these might not be
         features of the vendor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted might be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable
         involves consideration of additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.
       • Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the
         deliverable.
       • Column four is a summary of the vendor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the
         Standard.
       • Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected
         applicable provisions and actual product features.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.

    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in
      providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also
      an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.
