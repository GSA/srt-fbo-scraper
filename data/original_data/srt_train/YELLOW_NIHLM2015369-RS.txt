NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ) NO. NIHLM2015369 (Dated: 12/15/14) National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine Discovery and Delivery Platform INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO QUOTERS A. GENERAL INFORMATION NLM is issuing this Statement of Work (SOW) for purchasing web-based discovery and delivery software. The Library seeks to acquire the software hosted by a vendor with the technical expertise, resources, and experience to provide NLM with an industry-leading search platform. The scope of this procurement is the acquisition of web-based discovery and delivery software as well as the technical, management, and support services for implementing and maintaining the platform. The vendor shall host discovery and delivery software that provides a single, modern, and intuitive search platform for NLM's physical, electronic, and digital resources. It must interoperate with the library's ILS to enable users to remain in the search platform for research and traditional OPAC functionality such as requests for physical materials in the NLM collections. The software architecture should be open and extensively configurable, customizable, and expandable for incorporation of additional collection resources and for further NLM development in response to future needs. The vendor must establish security policies, procedures, and practices that meet the relevant security requirements set forth by the U.S. Federal Government. All of the mandatory requirements have to be fulfilled by the vendor's solution. For those desirable requirements that the vendor's software cannot currently meet, the vendor may opt to propose an alternative approach or method. 1. BACKGROUND See attached Statement of Work. 2.

As used in this provision­ Discussions are negotiations that occur that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the quoter being allowed to revise its quotation.

2

In writing or written means any worded or numbered expression which can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. Quotation modification is a change made to a quotation before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. Quotation revision is a change to a quotation made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. Time, if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Quoters shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of quotations. (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, quotations and modifications to quotations shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the quoter. Quoters using commercial carriers should ensure that the quotation is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision. (1) The first page of the quotation must show-(i) (ii) (iii) The solicitation number; The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the quoter (and electronic address if available); A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item; Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the quoter's behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the quotation. Quotations signed by an agent shall be accompanied by evidence of that agent's authority, unless 3

(c)

(iv)

(v)

that evidence has been previously furnished to the issuing office. (2) Late quotations and revisions. (i) Any quotation received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of quotes will not be considered unless it is received before award is made and-(A) It was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date specified for receipt of quotations (e.g., a quotation submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt of offers by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th); It was sent by mail (or telegram or facsimile, if authorized) or hand-carried (including delivery by a commercial carrier) if it is determined by the Government that the late receipt was due primarily to Government mishandling after receipt at the Government installation; It was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5:00 p.m. at the place of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of quotations. The term ``working days'' excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays; It was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation and was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of quotations; or There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the activity designated for receipt of quotations and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of quotations, and the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late quotation would not unduly delay the procurement; or It is the only quotation received.

(B)

(D)

(E)

(F) (ii)

Any modification or revision of a quotation or response to request for information, including any final quotation revision, is subject to the same conditions as in 4

subparagraphs (c)(3)(i)(A) through (c)(3)(i)(E) of this provision. (iii) The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late quotation or modification or revision sent either by registered or certified mail is the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date or the quotation, response to a request for information, or modification or revision shall be processed as if mailed late. ``Postmark'' means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service on the date of mailing. Therefore, quoters or respondents should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper. Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the quotation wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late quotation, modification or revision, or withdrawal sent by Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee is the date entered by the post office receiving clerk on the ``Express Mail Next Day Service-Post Office to Addressee'' label and the postmark on both the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. Postal Service. ``Postmark'' has the same meaning as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this provision, excluding postmarks of the Canadian Postal Service. Therefore, quoters or respondents should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this provision, a late modification or revision of an otherwise successful quotation that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

Quotations may be withdrawn by written notice or telegram (including mailgram) received at any time before award. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile quotations, quotations may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision entitled "Facsimile Proposals." Quotations may be withdrawn in person by a quoter or an authorized representative, if the representative's identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the quotation before award.

(viii) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that quotations cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of quotations by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of quotations will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office. (3) Quotations submitted must be on an all-or-none basis, e.g., quotations that propose to provide any single item or combination of several items shall be determined to be nonresponsive. Quotations submitted in response to this solicitation shall be in English and in U.S. dollars. Quoters may submit modifications to their quotations at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.

If, however, a purchase order is awarded to this quoter as a result of--or in connection with-- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting purchase order. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this quotation.

Purchase order award. (1) The Government intends to award a purchase order to the responsible quoter whose quotation represents the best value after an evaluation is conducted in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the Government's interest. The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received. The Government shall evaluate quotations and may award a purchase order without discussions with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quotation should contain the quoter's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity quoted, at the unit cost or prices quoted, unless the quoter specifies otherwise in the quotation. Exchanges with quoters after receipt of a quotation do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. The Government may determine that a quotation is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more line items is significantly 7

STATEMENT OF WORK 1. Project Title
National Library of Medicine Discovery and Delivery Platform

2. Background Information
The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is constantly striving to maximize the visibility, use, and value of the overall collections and make access to the library resources seamless and simple for patrons to use. LocatorPlus, NLM's online public access catalog (OPAC), has been the frontend search interface to many NLM resources managed in the Voyager integrated library system (ILS) since 1999. However, as information concepts and technology advance, the underlying technology, functionality, and user interface of conventional OPACs become obsolete and are therefore no longer aligned with user expectations. LocatorPlus is no exception. In an age when most users are accustomed to powerful search engines, NLM needs to offer a modern, comprehensive discovery and delivery interface that enables users to quickly and seamlessly access the rich bibliographic data, electronic resources, and full text content of the wide range of NLM collections. This procurement intends to enhance the NLM's search interface by replacing LocatorPlus with a state-of-the-art discovery and delivery solution produced by the library information system industry.

3. Objectives
NLM is issuing this Statement of Work (SOW) for purchasing web-based discovery and delivery software. The Library seeks to acquire the software hosted by a vendor with the technical expertise, resources, and experience to provide NLM with an industry-leading search platform.

4. Scope of Work
The scope of this procurement is the acquisition of web-based discovery and delivery software as well as the technical, management, and support services for implementing and maintaining the platform.

5. Description of Work
The vendor shall host discovery and delivery software that provides a single, modern, and intuitive search platform for NLM's physical, electronic, and digital resources. It must interoperate with the library's ILS to enable users to remain in the search platform for research and traditional OPAC functionality such as requests for physical materials in the NLM collections. The software architecture should be open and extensively configurable, customizable, and expandable for incorporation of additional collection resources and for further NLM development in response to future needs. The vendor must establish security policies, procedures, and practices that meet the relevant security requirements set forth by the U.S. Federal Government.

Page 3 of 46

The requirements for the discovery and delivery platform are detailed in the table below. All of the mandatory requirements have to be fulfilled by the vendor's solution. For those desirable requirements that the vendor's software cannot currently meet, the vendor may opt to propose an alternative approach or method.
