5352.201-9101
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this
acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman
does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not
participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The
ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to
the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency

                                                            Statement of Requirements

Media Asset Management (MAM): HQ AU/PAT (AUTV) is seeking to procure a comprehensive Media Asset Management system (MAM) which consists of
management tasks and decision logic surrounding the ingestion, annotation, cataloguing, storage, retrieval, editing and distribution of digital
assets. Production asset management focuses on managing assets as they are being created for a digital media production and library asset
management focuses on storage and retrieval of large amounts of infrequently changing media assets. Both collaborate together to form a unified
infrastructure insuring a comprehensive media asset management system. This system must integrate seamlessly with six existing Avid Media
Composers, a single Adobe Premier Editor and with an Adobe DVD authoring system. System will be based on an open architecture framework to
provide the greatest flexibility allowing for system upgradability, integration and interoperability. There will be a total of fifteen web
clients in addition to the six NLE systems. System will be populated at 72 terabytes with a minimum of 1.50Mb bandwidth. Storage system will
provide redundancy and will be configured to eliminate loss of assets or data in the event of a drive or equipment failure. All critical system
components will utilize redundant power supplies.
1.  Media Asset Management: Vendor will provide and install a highly customizable MAM (Media Asset Management) platform to integrate multiple
workflows and formats; news, programs, VOD (Video-On-Demand), DVD authoring and archives in one fluid system. Productions tools manage ingest
logging, production, distribution and archiving across systems and workgroups. The MAM must provide graphical user interface operations to
manipulate both media and metadata, from query, browse, simple edits, timeline editing, and lifecycle approval to metadata entry and frame
metadata entry.
An Integrated Media Asset Management approach built on open standards easily configurable through a standard interface supporting any desired
workflow, allow and restrict access to material, metadata, tools, and operation based on permissions assigned to each user or group. Manage
multiple, simultaneous requests for the same material. MAM must manage transparently the management of all media in multiple formats with all
associated metadata as well as the exchanges between different storage units and support media types including scripts (text), pictures,
graphics (images) and audio content as well as video in different formats and different resolutions and different bit rates. MAM media search
must be capable of returning objects (text, pictures, audio, video, projects) predefined with fields and levels of search that are most relevant
for every specific user and group. MAM must automate searchable metadata migration from parent media asset to all child media assets.

2.  MAM Open Platform for Integration:   MAM must provide a comprehensive Web Services API (Application Programming Interface) that meets the
principles of SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) provides point of access integration to interface third-party systems. With full integration,
media is made ubiquitous and metadata is tracked across the entire production chain. Architecture ensures scalability and redundancy. MAM is
required to manage a work flow that optimizes user tasks and connect users for collaboration with customizable contextual metadata schemas and a
search engine. Collaborative infrastructure must provide open system architecture providing flexible system integration and interoperability.
3.  Enterprise design must perform and provide the following:
    3.1  Enterprise class scalability, resilience, and flexibility.
    3.2  Fully transparent media operations, such as conversions and transfers.

    3.13  Complete set of functions: the API must includes a wide range of calls that enable not only media and metadata to be manipulated but
    also business processes to be integrated.
4.  Ingest Management must provide manual desktop Ingest tools with centralized ingest management and dedicated device controllers to automate
third-party devices such as routers, servers and VTRs recording in standard definition or high definition. MAM ingest will control simultaneous
feeds and make content available to all, seconds after recording starts. A conversion server processes and automatically creates a proxy by
transcoding the high resolution file. The low resolution proxy must be available for previewing and editing. MAM sharing of content and metadata
makes content accessible and searchable to everyone using MAM or third-party systems with relevant metadata and logging information rovers and
instant access provided. Manual annotations are saved and indexed in the database and can be shared, users can insert markers and regions.
Markers are time stamped and regions are In and Out time code segments. System will allow users to preview and select clips from P2 media before
ingesting. System will provide full preview to include audio/video and P2 metadata. All or some of the clips will be ingested into the MAM.

        Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting
        Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of a subsequent contract.
        If a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer is not negotiated within the time limits prescribed by the contracting
        activity and such failure arises out of cause within the control and with the fault or negligence of the offeror, the offeror shall be
        ineligible for an award.  The Contracting Officer shall notify the contractor in writing of the reasons for determining a subcontracting
        plan unacceptable early enough in the negotiation process to allow the contractor to modify the plan within the time limits prescribed.


        *If all offerors provide an acceptable justification that no subcontracting possibilities exists, this evaluation sub factor will be
        determined “no applicable.”


B.  The Government will evaluate the price proposals, and any other relevant proposal data submitted, to determine if proposed prices are
reasonable and balanced based on the offeror (s) proposed approach.

Price will contribute substantially to the source selection decision, and the source selection will be conducted with the expectation of
adequate price competition per FAR 15.403-1(c) (1), therefore, cost or pricing data are not required.  However, the offeror may be required to
submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine price reasonableness.

1) TOTAL EVALUATED PRICE:  The Government will determine one total price for this requirement.  The total price will consist of the basic
   software, equipment, labor and support identified in CLINs 0001 through 0004.




2)  All proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness.  A Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be presented to the Source Selection Authority (SSA)
   for award decision purposes.  The offeror’s TEP will be the sum of all firm-fixed price Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs).  The Government
   may use any of the following price analysis techniques IAW FAR 15.404-1(b): comparison of proposed prices received, comparison of previously
   proposed prices and previous Government and commercial prices, use of parametric estimating/rough yardsticks, comparison with competitive
   published price list or market prices, comparison with independent Government cost estimates, comparison with market research, and analysis of
   pricing information provided by the offeror.





   If the price analysis techniques are insufficient to make a determination of price reasonableness, the contracting officer may request
   information other than cost or pricing data in order to make a determination of price reasonableness.








3) To the extent necessary, the Contracting Officer may use other proposal analysis techniques, such as technical analysis and cost analysis to
   be evaluated for unbalanced pricing (FAR 15.404-1(g)).  Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price
   of one or more contract line items or sub line item appears to be significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of
   price analysis techniques.  An offeror’s proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an
   unacceptable risk to the Government.   Also a contract will not be awarded to an offeror whose price is not determined reasonable.

C.  The Government will evaluate past performance to assess how well the offeror performed work relevant to the type of effort and type of
requirement described in the solicitation as an indicator of an offeror’s ability to perform the contract successfully.  The Government will use
the following procedures in evaluating past performance:

      (1)  The Government will accomplish the past performance evaluation, assigning a performance confidence assessment rating to the offeror’s
   proposal based on performance ratings of recent and relevant efforts.

        (2)  The Government will seek relevant performance information from: (i) past and present efforts provided by the offeror (using
   questionnaires, which are forwarded by the offeror to their selected sources or forwarded by the contracting officer to the contractor’s
   selected sources, and (ii) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  The past performance evaluation will
   take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel, or subcontractors that will perform major or
   critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.  The past performance evaluation may also
   consider the past performance of affiliated companies or operating divisions within the parent company or joint ventures of the parent company
   when it is reasonable to attribute the experience of these past efforts to the proposed effort and when the  proposal clearly demonstrates the
   resources (e.g. financial resources, overall oversight and management or other resources) of the parent or affiliated division will
   meaningfully affect performance of the instant acquisition. The past performance of teaming partners or subcontractors who are proposed to
   perform less than 20% of the work &/or are not proposed to perform critical aspects will not be evaluated.




           (a)  Recency is defined as performance occurring within the last three (3) years of the date of this solicitation, except that
           ongoing programs must have begun no less than three (3) months from issuance of the RFP.


           (b) Relevant performance includes contracts that meet the definition of scope, magnitude and complexity, as follows:
           Scope:  Provided equipment and installation of a Media Asset Management system.
           Magnitude:  Greater than $100,000.00 in total value
           Complexity:  Installed a comprehensive Media Asset Management system (MAM) which consists of management tasks and decision logic
           surrounding the ingestion, annotation, cataloguing, storage, retrieval, editing and distribution of digital assets.
           Relevancy will be assigned ratings of Very Relevant, Relevant, Somewhat Relevant, and Not Relevant.  The Government will give greater
           consideration to performance on those contracts deemed more relevant to the effort described in this RFP.  In determining relevancy
           for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming
           partner, or subcontractor.


           The following table provides relevancy definitions that will be used:


RELEVANCY DEFINITIONS

|RATING                            |DEFINITION                                                                                   |
|Very Relevant                     |Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and        |
|                                  |complexities this solicitation requires.                                                     |
|Relevant                          |Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities    |
|                                  |this solicitation requires.                                                                  |
|Somewhat Relevant                 |Present/past performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities    |
|                                  |this solicitation requires.                                                                  |
|Not Relevant                      |Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and           |
|                                  |complexities this solicitation requires.                                                     |

           c) Performance information may be obtained from the references on each project submitted.  The Government may also obtain performance
              data from other sources.


              i) In addition to evaluating the extent to which the offeror’s performance meets basic contract PWS and technical requirements,
                 the assessment will consider things such as the offeror’s history of forecasting and controlling costs (if applicable,)
                 adhering to schedules, (including the administrative aspects of performance), reasonable and cooperative behavior and
                 commitment to customer satisfaction.


             ii) Where a relevant performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the
                 problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).  The
                 Government may review more recent projects or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and
                 evaluate their effectiveness.

            iii) The following performance definitions will be used in the assessment of performance.






   PERFORMANCE DEFINITIONS
|PERFORMANCE              |DEFINITION                                                                                      |
|RATING                   |                                                                                                |
|Exceptional              |Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many requirements to the Government’s    |
|                         |benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with few   |
|                         |minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.      |
|Very Good                |Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some requirements to the Government’s    |
|                         |benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some  |
|                         |minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.             |
|Satisfactory             |Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being   |
|                         |assessed contained some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor     |
|                         |appear or were satisfactory.                                                                    |
|Marginal                 |Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the    |
|                         |element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet          |
|                         |identified corrective actions or the contractor’s actions appear only marginally effective or   |
|                         |were not fully implemented.                                                                     |
|Unsatisfactory           |Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely  |
|                         |manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s)  |
|                         |for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective.                       |
|Not Applicable           |Unable to provide a score.  Performance in this area is not applicable to the effort assessed.  |


      (3)  The Government will integrate the resentcy, relevancy and performance on all the efforts evaluated for the offeror; the integration
      will result in a performance confidence assessment of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence,
      or Unknown Confidence as defined below for the offeror.  Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or whose performance
      record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating of “Unknown Confidence”,
      meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.


 PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT DEFINITIONS
|Rating                         |Definition                                                                                      |
|Substantial Confidence         |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the       |
|                               |offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                                          |
|Satisfactory Confidence        |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the Government has an expectation that the offeror   |
|                               |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                  |
|Limited Confidence             |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror|
|                               |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                  |
|No Confidence                  |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror   |
|                               |will be able to successfully perform the required effort.                                       |
|Unknown Confidence             |No performance record is identifiable or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no  |
|                               |confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.                                        |



D.  After initial evaluation of each offeror’s technical and price proposals, and assessment of each offeror’s past performance, if the lowest
reasonably priced technically acceptable offer (by TEP) is determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, and has a Substantial Confidence
performance confidence assessment rating, award will be made to that offeror without entering into discussions as this represents the best value
to the Government.

E.  If the lowest reasonably priced offer (by TEP) does not have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment rating, the next
lowest reasonably priced, technically acceptable, and responsible offeror will be considered and the process will continue (in order by TEP)
until the Government reaches an offer with a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment rating or until all offers are considered,
whichever occurs first.  The Source Selection Authority will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision unless it is in the
Government’s best interest to conduct discussions.

F.  The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  Offerors shall submit sufficient information and
in the format specified in Proposal Preparation Instructions.  Offeror’s may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g., the
relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an
opportunity to respond.  Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on
any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.  Exchanges conducted with regard to
adverse past performance or to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions, and the contracting officer reserves the right
to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.

G. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.  If the Government elects to hold
discussions, a competitive range will be established based on FAR 15.306(c) procedures and this solicitation.  The Government reserves the right
to further limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the
most highly rated proposals.  If the contracting officer determines that an offeror’s proposal should no longer be included in the competitive
range, the proposal will be eliminated from consideration for award.  Written notice of this decision shall be provided to unsuccessful offerors
in accordance with FAR 15.503.  Offerors excluded or otherwise eliminated from the competitive range may request a debriefing in accordance with
FAR 15.505 or 15.506.

H.   After conclusion of discussions and receipt of final proposal revisions, the Government will rank all offers by TEP.  If the lowest
reasonably priced technically acceptable offer (by TEP), is determined responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104, and has a Substantial
Confidence performance confidence assessment rating, award will be made to that offeror as this represents the best value to the Government.  If
the lowest reasonably priced offer (by TEP) does not have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment rating, the next lowest
reasonably priced, technically acceptable, and responsible offeror will be considered, and the process will continue (in order by TEP) until the
Government reaches an offer with a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment rating or until all offers are considered, whichever
occurs first.  The Source Selection Authority will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the

-

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
