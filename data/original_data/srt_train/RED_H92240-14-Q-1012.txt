ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items
Proposal preparation instructions are attached separately.


52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (JAN 1999):

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose proposal conforming to the
solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The Government will evaluate all proposals as acceptable or unacceptable for the Technical  factor.  The Price Factor will not be evaluated as
acceptable or unacceptable; however, this factor will be evaluated for reasonableness.

       Factor 1: Technical
       Factor 2: Price


       Techncical:
        Subfactor 1: Technical Capability/Approach
        Subfactor 2: Contractor’s General Capabilities and Policies
        Subfactor 3: Site Security
        Subfactor 4: Key Personnel
        Subfactor 5: Contractor’s Team
        Subfactor 6: Past Performance


       Each technical subfactor will be rated either acceptable or unacceptable.  A technical proposal receiving an unacceptable rating for any
       subfactor will be determined unacceptable and no further consideration will be given.




       |Rating                        |Description                                                                               |
|Acceptable (A)                |Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.                      |
|Unacceptable (U)              |Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.              |




      Price:  The Government will evaluate price based on the aggregate total prices submitted for the Base and four (4) one-year  Option CLINs
      (see Excel pricing spreadsheet).


Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement. While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final
contract award will be based on the combination of the factors above.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance
specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.
