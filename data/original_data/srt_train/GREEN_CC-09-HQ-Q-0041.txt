1.06 The EIT deliverables shall provide at least one mode of operation and information retrieval that does not require fine motor control or simultaneous actions and that is operable with limited reach and strength. 36 CFR 1194.31(f)
1.07 If the system utilizes dynamic updates or features within any user interface, including a Web-based interface, the system must provide support for assistive technology such as tracking focus, providing user-controlled keyboard or automatic navigation (focus control) to updated content to ensure the updated information is available to users who are blind or have low vision disabilities compariable to access by users without disabilities.  When this type of dynamic functionality exist within a Web site, such as but not limited to the use of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), Macromedia Flash, or similar approach or technology, the Web interface is required to comply with item 4 "Software Applications" as OCC has identified these emerging technologies as not being accessible by using "Web" standards alone.  The use of "Software" standards in these instances satisfy compliance by supporting the Functional Performance Criteria as required. 36 CFR 1194.5
2.0 Web-based Technical Requirements 

Applies to all Web-based deliverables, including documentation and reports procured or developed under this work statement. When any Web application uses a dynamic (non-static) interface, embeds custom user control(s), embeds video or multimedia, uses proprietary or technical approaches such as, but not limited to, Flash or Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX) then “1194.21 Software” standards also apply to fulfill functional performance criteria.
2.01 A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content).  This includes but not limited to all input fields, images, objects, links included on the Web (browser) interface. 36 CFR 1194.22(a)
2.02 Equivalent alternatives (audio and visual content) for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation.  All Web-based multimedia must also comply with item 4 (Software Applications) and item 5 (Video and Multimedia Technical Requirements) of this matrix. 36 CFR 1194.22(b)
2.03 All Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 36 CFR 1194.22(c)
2.04 Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. 36 CFR 1194.22(d)
2.05 No server-side image maps are to be used without OCC Contracting Officer or COTR approval after consultation with OCC Section 508 Program Office. 36 CFR 1194.22(e)
2.06 Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps 36 CFR 1194.22(f)
2.07 Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 36 CFR 1194.22(g)
2.08 Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers.  When using tables for the display of form fields, table headers shall not substitute for the use of explicit labels as identified in 2.14 36 CFR 1194.22(h)
36 CFR 1194.22(n)
2.09 Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. 36 CFR 1194.22(i)
2.1 Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz.  To measure this for compliance, OCC will focus on the existence of flashing items that are recognizable with the naked eye and if noticable, the blink rate shall be flashing slower than 2 "blinks" per second.  Any noticable flash exceeding this threshold will be considered a violation of this requirement.  No use of marquee or scrolling content is permitted without prior approval from the OCC Contracting Officer or COTR with consultation with OCC Section 508 Program Office. 36 CFR 1194.22(j)
2.11 The system shall use a standard (single) interface that is accessible to both users with and without disabilites with rare exception.  Upon rare exception with OCC Contracting Officer or COTR approval in accordance with instructions below, providing a text-only page with equivalent information or functionality may be permitted to make a web site accessible, when accessibility and conformance of this requirement cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes.  All request for approval will need to clearly identify that it is technically impossible to provide the page in an accessible format based on OCC business needs, not design choice or preferred technical approach, with an operational plan showing that safeguards are in place that will update the text-only page whenever the primary page changes.  NOTE: This system is intended to be a "one system accessible to all end-users" design, regardless of disability. 36 CFR 1194.22(k)
2.12 When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology.  This does not prohibit the use of scripting but does require that when scripting is used, the information is readily accessible to assistive technology, has appropriate functional text, and is fully functional via the keyboard. 36 CFR 1194.22(l)
36 CFR 1194.31
36 CFR 1194.21(a)
2.13 When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in, or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page shall provide a link to the plug-in or applet that complies with item 4 (Software Applications) of this matrix.  For the purposes of applications intended to be limited to internal OCC use (Intranet), OCC will not require a link be present on each page.  OCC internal policies prohibit users from loading applications on their workstations without approval.  If plug-ins are necessary, this does not exempt the vendor from ensuring that the plug-in complies with item 4 (Software Applications of this matrix).  OCC will satisfy the "link availability" through it's internal process for installation of software on OCC workstations. 36 CFR 1194.22(m)
2.14 When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.  OCC requires the use of explicit labels in all instances.  Explicit labels include but not limit the proper use of the HTML <label> tag when applicable.  For non-HTML technical approaches, the measurement of compliance will be evaluated based on item 4 (Sofware Applications). 36 CFR 1194.22(n)
2.15 A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. 36 CFR 1194.22(o)
2.16 When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required.  For the purpose of measuring "sufficient time", OCC has determined that 30 seconds for end-of-session or inactivity log-out based on security requirements is acceptable. 36 CFR 1194.22(p)

4. Frequently Asked Questions
(1)  Why does the OCC require its service providers to complete this self assessment questionnaire? (5)  How does the government define "security control"? The E-Government Act of 2002 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directives require that all information systems that process government information maintain adequate security. "Adequate security" is commensurate with the harm that would result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of information. Adequate security ensures that systems and applications operate effectively and provide appropriate measures of confidentiality, integrity, and availability through the use of managerial, operational, and technical security controls. This requirement applies to all information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the government, including those provided or managed by another government agency, contractor, or other source. (2)  What does "information security" mean? "Information security" is protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. (3)  What does "information system" mean? An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, transmission, and dissemination of information, in accordance with defined procedures, whether automated or manual. (4)  What do the terms "confidentiality, integrity and availability" mean? The OCC's information security controls are based on Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 200. Security controls are the management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a system and its information. Management controls focus on the management of risk and the management of information system security. Operational controls are those safeguards that are primarily implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). Technical controls are primarily implemented and executed by an information system through mechanisms in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system. (6)  What is FIPS 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems," and where can I find more information about it?

That publication is a mandatory standard (it cannot be waived) developed in response to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. The combination of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 establishes the foundation for most federal information security practices and procedures. (7)  What is NIST Special Publication (SP) 80053, Revision II, "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems," December 2007 and where can I find more information on it?

Confidentiality is preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. Integrity is protecting information from improper modification or destruction, and includes ensuring that information is authentic and reliable. Availability is ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.

That publication provides guidelines for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government. These guidelines apply to all components of an information system that process, store, or transmit federal information. The publication provides guidance to federal agencies implementing FIPS 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems."
