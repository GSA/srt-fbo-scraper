      Introduction


This U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Systems Engineering Life Cycle (SELC) Guide discusses the processes used to create and
maintain Information Technology (IT) solutions for USCIS projects and is in compliance with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) SELC.
This Guide supersedes all previous lifecycle management guides and is intended to serve as a handbook on how to manage USCIS IT projects using
the SELC methodology.


The SELC differs from a standard Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in that it introduces a necessary acquisition and investment review
component.  In addition to the acquisition/investment review component, the USCIS implementation of the DHS SELC introduces a new USCIS
governance structure for managing stage reviews and approvals.


The USCIS SELC Guide also defines specific engineering and documentation requirements that apply to all USCIS releases.  It is NOT a replacement
for DHS guidance but provides the additional guidance needed to successfully deploy IT solutions at USCIS.


With the USCIS implementation of the DHS SELC, the focus and applicability of SELC methodology is extended to a broader scope of technology
initiatives.  It will extend to USCIS change and enhancement initiatives that in the past may not have been managed using a formal SELC
methodology.


1 Authority


The USCIS SELC Guide is an extension of DHS Acquisition Directive 102-01, November 7, 2008 and Version 2.0 of the DHS Systems Engineering Life
Cycle, September 2010.  Each DHS Component is given the authority to tailor the DHS SELC for Level 3 projects[1].  From this authority, USCIS is
evolving processes that are designed to streamline work activities associated with the SELC in this Guide.


The Chief Information Officer (CIO) establishes the USCIS SELC policy, processes, and procedures, reflecting DHS guidance.  The Office of
Information Technology (OIT) Enterprise Program Management Office (EPMO) manages and maintains the USCIS SELC.


2 Applicability

All USCIS personnel and technology project teams must adhere to USCIS SELC processes when developing or modifying USCIS IT.  Any departure from
the SELC process requirements and guidelines requires documented authorization from the USCIS CIO or CIO designee.  The USCIS SELC process
applies to all USCIS IT projects, including new systems, operational systems, pilots, infrastructure devices, and field technology initiatives.


DHS classifies projects into three levels as shown below in Exhibit 1.1.  The levels determine the extent and scope of required project and
program reporting requirements and the appropriate Acquisition Decision Authority (ADA).


                                                Exhibit 1.1 – Thresholds and Decision Authorities

|Program/Project Level      |Acquisition Threshold         |Acquisition Decision Authority      |SELC Stage                                    |
|                           |                              |                                    |Decision Authority                            |
|1                          |$1B LCC* or greater           |DHS, Deputy Secretary               |USCIS Chief Information Officer (CIO)         |
|2                          |Between $300M and $1B LCC     |DHS, Under Secretary for Management |USCIS CIO                                     |
|3                          |Less than $300M LCC           |USCIS, Component Acquisition        |USCIS CIO                                     |
|                           |                              |Executive                           |                                              |


* LCC: Life Cycle Cost (in constant FY09 $)

The USCIS CIO is the decision authority for SELC stages, approving programs/projects to advance to the next stage.


In the USCIS implementation of the DHS SELC, new investments and major enhancements require project registration.  Contact the USCIS OIT EPMO
for more information on project registration and assistance in determining if a project meets the requirements for registration.


3 Objectives


The objectives of the USCIS SELC process include the following:

    • Improve the likelihood of successfully completing USCIS IT projects based on scope, risk, and context;
    • Eliminate/minimize risk to the production environment;
    • Support the production and integration of quality technology products into the operational environment;
    • Provide a significant degree of flexibility for projects within a structured lifecycle framework; and
    • Increase production efficiency, reduce production costs, and ensure efficient use of existing capabilities and infrastructure.

4 Document Organization


Section 2 of this Guide provides an introduction to the DHS SELC, highlighting key components of the life cycle with information on how this
life cycle will apply to USCIS project managers and other stakeholders in the project life cycle.  It also explains at a high level how the
USCIS SELC relates to the DHS SELC and how the pre-existing USCIS ITLM Version 2.0 compares to the USCIS SELC, describing key differences to
assist project managers and other stakeholders.


Section 3 describes SELC requirements for each of the nine stages of the life cycle and presents critical information for each stage of the
SELC, including:




    • Explain the stage.  This subsection defines the stage as implemented within USCIS.
    • Requirements for the stage.  This subsection provides a list of artifacts that are required for the various reviews within a particular
      stage.
    • USCIS provisions for this stage.  This subsection explains how the stage will be implemented at USCIS.  It describes additional artifacts,
      reviews, and approvals required by USCIS SELC guidelines.

Section 4 of this guide provides references for more information on the DHS SELC, SELC templates, and the USCIS IT Document Library (ITDL).


The USCIS SELC Guide will be refined as IT processes within USCIS evolve.  To provide feedback or recommendations concerning the guide, contact
the USCIS OIT EPMO at USCIS-SA-REQUESTS@dhs.gov.






      What is the SELC?


The SELC is a systems engineering framework for enabling efficient and effective delivery of capability to users.  A SELC guides the definition,
execution, and management of an interdisciplinary set of tasks required to plan, define, design, develop, test, implement, operate, and dispose
of systems.


The purpose of the SELC Guide is to standardize the system life cycle process across USCIS and to ensure that USCIS capabilities are efficiently
and effectively delivered.  The USCIS SELC Guide is designed to ensure that appropriate activities are planned and implemented in each stage of
the life cycle to increase a project’s success.


1 DHS SELC


The DHS SELC is the systems engineering methodology mandated for use throughout the DHS enterprise as prescribed in the DHS Acquisition
Instruction Guidebook 102-01-001, Appendix B - Systems Engineering Life Cycle (SELC) and DHS Systems Engineering Life Cycle, Appendix B, Systems
Engineering Life Cycle (SELC), Part I, Version 2.0.  The purpose of the DHS SELC is to standardize the management of systems life cycle
processes across DHS.  The DHS guidance describes:

    • DHS SELC and its relationship to other enterprise-wide processes
    • DHS SELC roles and responsibilities
    • DHS SELC elements
    o Stages, including activities and products
    o Entry/exit criteria
    o Reviews
    • System development methodologies, guidance on their usage, and methods for customization

This USCIS SELC Guide provides guidance that program and project managers can use to manage Level 1, 2 and 3 programs/projects, with a focus on
providing guidance for managing Level 3 projects and releases where USCIS has the most latitude in governing review and approval.


Exhibit 2.1 includes a high level representation of the DHS SELC in context with the DHS Acquisition Review Process (ARP) and the DHS Capital
Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) life cycle.  At key points within the SELC, the work of the stage and the results of the stage review
serve as input to decisions in the ARP process.  An example is the Solution Engineering stage.  The activities and documentation completed
during this stage and for the Solution Engineering Review become inputs to the ARP 2A Acquisition Decision Event (ADE) where the program is
approved.  The CPIC life cycle phases address the funding for new investments as well as continued funding and performance oversight for ongoing
investments.  Appendix D contains a more detailed diagram of the processes and lifecycles.

                                                                      [pic]


2 USCIS SELC relationship to the DHS SELC


This USCIS SELC Guide is intended to serve as a handbook on how to manage USCIS IT programs and projects using the SELC methodology.  The USCIS
SELC meets the requirements of the DHS SELC.  In some cases, the USCIS SELC uses USCIS-unique templates, where appropriate, to fulfill document
requirements; and combines reviews, where appropriate, to help reduce required documentation and streamline the review process.  The goal is to
ensure that documentation and review requirements are appropriate to the scope, cost, complexity, and risk of the project while meeting
requirements for enterprise architecture, privacy, Section 508, security, and other mandates as dictated by legislation, regulation, and policy.


IT projects approved and registered prior to the release of this document were permitted to be managed using USCIS ITLM V2.0 processes,
templates, and guidelines until December 31, 2010.  Those projects are now being re-assessed for compliance to DHS SELC standards.


All new programs, projects, changes, or releases must follow the USCIS SELC methodology.


1 Assistance with the SELC


OIT EPMO staff is available to assist business owners, project managers, infrastructure liaisons, or anyone leading a project, change, or
release initiative to clarify life cycle requirements, provide templates, and generally guide programmatic activities associated with SELC
compliance. Additionally, EPMO representatives will provide guidance in crafting an appropriate Project Tailoring Plan (PTP), developing
documentation, and preparing for reviews.  Contact the EPMO to request assistance.


2 Major Changes from Version 1.0 of this Guide


At the program level, where applicable, Version 2.0 of the DHS SELC adds documents and reviews.  A greater emphasis is placed on capital
investment, needs analysis, and program reporting.


At the release level, Version 2.0 of the DHS SELC moves some key activities and documents into other phases of the life cycle.  For example,
many Enterprise Architecture documents moved to the Needs phase of the process.


Perhaps the greatest change, however, is the movement of the Project Tailoring Plan from the Solutions Engineering Phase to the Project Planning
Phase of the life cycle.  This change affects all releases and gives us an opportunity to eliminate Solutions Engineering Reviews for many
releases.


Changes will be covered in greater detail as we examine life cycle requirements later in this guide.


3 USCIS ITLM v2.0 comparison to DHS SELC


The systems engineering life cycle methodology as prescribed by the USCIS ITLM V2.0 was largely in sync with the new DHS SELC methodology.  Once
mission needs are defined and validated, both processes require an approved PTP.  Generally, both processes lead off with defining and analyzing
the mission needs (Initiation)[2], followed by Planning, Requirements, Design, Test, and Deployment (Implementation) through to Operations and
Maintenance (O&M).  Both processes also specify certain artifacts to be developed in phases, each of which includes a formal review.


Outside of life cycle artifact requirements, a list of fundamental differences that the DHS SELC brings to USCIS SELC processes includes:

    • Addition of two new stages in the life cycle:  the Solution Engineering stage and the Disposition stage,
    • New governance structure for reviews and approval, and
    • Applicability of the DHS SELC methodology to all USCIS projects.

Where the ITLM referred to a phase of the life cycle, the SELC uses the term, stage, and, where similar or the same ITLM artifacts are required
in the SELC, in some cases, the artifacts may now be required earlier in the SELC review process.


At a very high level, the changes can be illustrated as in Exhibit 2.2 with the DHS SELC superimposed in bright yellow over ITLM Version 2.0 in
light blue; the dark blue represents input requirements from the Need Phase of the USCIS Acquisition and Investment Management process.


                                           Exhibit 2.2 – DHS SELC overlaid on the ITLM, Version 2.0[3]


                                                                      [pic]


In summary, the differences between the DHS SELC and ITLM Version 2.0 include stage changes, governance changes, methodology changes, and
stage/gate review changes.  These changes, and how they apply to program sponsors and project managers, are discussed in more detail in Section
3.


1 Phase/Stage Changes


As shown in Exhibit 2.2, the SELC introduces the Solution Engineering stage as a new stage in the SELC life cycle.  Inputs from the Need phase
feed into the Solution Engineering stage and outputs from the Solution Engineering stage feed into the Planning stage.  Sections 3.1 and 3.2
provide guidance on required inputs and outputs in the Need phase and Solution Engineering stage. Another key change concerns the ITLM Test and
Deployment phase.  This phase becomes two stages in the SELC—an Integration and Test stage followed by an Implementation stage.  Details on
requirements for these stages are covered in Sections 3.7 and 3.8.  With these exceptions, the stages of the SELC map closely to the phases in
the ITLM.


2 Stage Review Changes


Stage reviews in the SELC are similar in concept to ITLM phase reviews, but some have different names.  For example,

    • Planning Review becomes the Project Planning Review (PPR).
    • Requirements Review becomes the System Definition Review (SDR).
    • Preliminary Architecture and Design Review (PADR) becomes the Preliminary Design Review (PDR).
    • Final Architecture and Design Review (FADR) becomes the Critical Design Review (CDR).
    • Test Readiness Review becomes the Integration Readiness Review (IRR).
    • Release Readiness Review becomes the Operational Readiness Review (ORR).

In addition, there is a new intermediate Stage review—the Production Readiness Review (PRR)—as part of the Integration and Test stage.


The most significant change is that the DHS SELC does not support a Notice of Intent to Release (NIR) process as an alternative to the PTP for
minor releases; all releases re-engage with a PTP.


Another comparison of the two approaches is presented in Exhibit 2.3.

USCIS is responsible for ensuring that SELC stage review entry and exit criteria are satisfied in order to authorize projects to move to the
next stage.[5]





4 Navigating SELC Reviews


SELC reviews consist of formal meetings to address one or more specific steps or stages in the SELC process.  These meetings follow an agenda
with entry and exit criteria appropriate to the step or stage.  High-level exit criteria are documented in Approval Certification Templates for
each stage review and the documentation is posted with the SELC templates on the ITDL and OIT Website.  In addition, a Quality Assurance (QA)
analyst is available to assist with document assessment and stage review approval criteria.  Contact the EPMO to request QA assistance and for
more information on approval certification requirements for each stage.


USCIS SELC Gate Reviews will be managed under a new governance structure where the USCIS CIO or CIO designee is the approving exit/entry
authority.  In the new governance structure, the EPMO acts on behalf of the CIO to coordinate and facilitate final approval at reviews.  Final
approval by the USCIS CIO at reviews is documented in a Decision Document and communicated by the EPMO to the business owner and other
stakeholders.

                                                                      [pic]









      selc stages


The SELC framework enables oversight of the investment, acquisition, technical, security, and quality aspects of technology projects and
management of the integration of technology into the USCIS environment.  The SELC process is adaptive and provides for quick and efficient
response to mission needs as they arise, yet provides a consistent and stable framework for managing USCIS technology projects.


The SELC has nine stages, which are described in the subsections below.  The activities in each stage contribute to the successful planning,
development, and implementation of IT programs/projects.  The subsections also list the artifacts that may be required for each stage, depending
on the nature of the program/project.


The SELC process commences when an approved business need for an IT capability is received.





1 Decision Point – Where to begin?


Project teams engage in phases of the life cycle depending on the nature of their work.  This can be somewhat subjective, but certain rules are
clear.  Guidelines are presented in the exhibit below.

                                                     Exhibit 3.1 – SELC Engagement Guidelines

|Starting a Level 3 major release                                             |Solutions Engineering                             |

|Dispositioning a system                                                      |Planning, followed by Disposition                 |


Level 3 major releases are the most difficult to gauge.  Here we must first ask whether the mission need has changed and then determine whether
the scope of the changes requires updates to the concept of operations, operational requirements, life cycle cost estimate, logistics support
plan, acquisition plan, or program baseline.  Significant changes to any of these elements generally dictate a return to the Needs Phase; other
releases may be permitted to engage at Planning.


Exceptions are possible.  For example, when a Level 3 release involves major security or privacy risks a return to Solutions Engineering may be
advised or required.  Conversely, if a new acquisition is incidental to the release[6], the project may be authorized to start at Planning.
Also, where new Level 3 systems are based on a shared infrastructure, a common foundation of design and program documents, and a strong
development methodology (such as SMART or SLOPE), new systems may engage at the Planning phase of the life cycle.  Finally, when a critical fix
is necessary to maintain operations, an emergency release may be authorized to permit engagement at the Development phase.


Project teams are strongly encouraged to engage early with Process Control to determine the proper engagement point and level of documentation
and review that will be required during for a given program, system, or release.  Under SELC 2.0, this engagement should be accomplished via
informal kickoff meetings that take place at or near the start of the process, prior to any formal reviews.  This activity will help determine
the work pattern and likely PTP elements that will be used by project to navigate through SELC processes.





2 Entry to the USCIS SELC – Need Phase


An approved business need serves as the entry point into the USCIS SELC. The approval of the need—or Need Phase—is where the requirement for an
IT capability is identified and validated.  Need approval is currently obtained through an ADE-1 Review at DHS or CARB equivalent within USCIS.
Requests are reviewed by several boards and authorities to ensure that the requests have suitable funding and align with DHS and USCIS
directives, standards, guidelines, architecture, and business needs.  In the future, Business Owners will obtain approval for the need through
the USCIS Acquisition and Investment Management process (currently under development). This process will define the methods for obtaining
approval for various thresholds of IT investments.


The Need phase begins when a Business Owner identifies that a need or gap exists for a new IT capability.  A business need may be determined in
different ways:  through strategic planning activities; through EA activities; from implementation of legislation, regulations, or other policy;
through user requests; etc.


The Business Owner further defines the need and completes documentation describing the required capability and the associated benefits as well
as the impacts of not implementing the capability. The description, benefits, and impacts provide information to distinguish among business
needs for decision-making purposes.


The required documentation is submitted and USCIS then reviews, validates, and approves the need. Please consult with EPMO to determine the
correct review process and submission requirements.


1 What are the requirements for this phase?


ADE-0 is the decision point where USCIS stakeholders select their initiatives to form the basis of the activities in the Need phase. Two key
documents for the Need phase are the Mission Need Statement (MNS) and the Capability Development Plan (CDP).  The MNS explains and communicates
the required capability gap.  The CDP serves as an agreement concerning the activities, cost, schedule, and performance boundaries of the work
to be performed in the Analyze/Select phase of the Acquisition and Investment Management process.


The Business Owner develops the MNS to provide a clear, unambiguous description of the required capability without reference to solutions or
technology.  The Business Owner uses the MNS to make the case for the needed capability and to obtain approval to proceed with continued
exploration and analysis of potential solutions to provide the capability or fill the capability gap.


A well developed CDP demonstrates the Business Owner’s solid understanding of the identified gap or business need and documents the Business
Owner’s strategy for developing a solution set along with a list of criteria by which the proposed solution set should be evaluated. The CDP is
an essential document used as a basis for approval of the business need to move forward to the Solution Engineering Stage.

Exhibit 3.2 lists the output requirements for the Need Phase (input requirements to the Solution Engineering stage).

2 USCIS Provisions for the Need Phase


The program kickoff meeting serves as the trigger for initiating IT involvement in the Need Phase. Level 1, 2, and Special Interest
programs/projects require additional review and approval by the DHS Acquisition Review Board (ARB) at ADE 1, before proceeding with Solution
Engineering.  Investments that require review by DHS will be reviewed and approved by USCIS prior to the DHS review.  Business will need the
required approval through the USCIS Acquisition and Investment Management process at ADE 1 (Validate Need), depending on the level of the
investment. The approval is documented with a Need Approval Memo.


3  Solution Engineering (Stage A) of the SELC


Solution Engineering (SE) is the first stage (Stage A) in the SELC as shown in Exhibit 3.3.  As discussed in the previous section, the approved
business need triggers the SE stage.  The purpose of the SE stage is to conduct analysis and systems engineering to determine the approach that
best addresses the need or capability gap described in the MNS.


The SE stage has two stage reviews:  the SPR and the SER.  An SPR and an SER are required for Level 1 and 2 programs/projects.  However for
Level 3 projects, the SPR may be combined in some cases with the SER as part of SELC tailoring. (Reference DHS Acquisition Instruction/Guidebook
102-01-001: Appendix B, Section 2.3 - Project Tailoring, Deviations, and Waivers, for more information on project tailoring.).


                                                  Exhibit 3.3 – Solution Engineering in the SELC


                                                                      [pic]


1 Explain the Solution Engineering Stage


The objective of the Solution Engineering Stage is to identify, analyze, and objectively select the preferred solution alternatives via a formal
Analysis of Alternatives to meet the approved mission needs.  SE is a new stage added to the USCIS SELC, the emphasis of which is to propose a
viable approach to resolve the needs and process gaps identified by the Business Owner.  SE stage activities encourage collaboration and
communication among all stakeholders—including the Business Owner, the Business Process Manager, and OIT—during the process of determining the
best solution to:

    • Ensure a clear understanding of the requirements,
    • Facilitate awareness of possible existing solutions and thus avoid duplication of effort, and
    • Promote early discovery as to the feasibility or non-feasibility of the proposed approach.


When a business need is derived from a mandate by Congress, this collaboration and communication ensures that the effort is identified as a high
priority and the appropriate enterprise attention has been placed on the requirements and resulting project(s).


While the SE stage has a number of documentation requirements, these requirements are “tailored,” depending on the complexity, cost, and
enterprise priority of the project.  Project tailoring is the method used to ensure the required documentation set reflects the scope of the
effort.  The EPMO QA Analysts in the Process Control Branch are available to assist as needed in identifying needed document content in this
stage.  Additionally, one-on-one assistance is available, as needed, to support the Business Owner in preparing documents and briefing materials
for the project, which meet the requirements and criteria for successfully completing the SE stage.


2 What are the requirements for this stage?


The prerequisites for Solution Engineering are the approved MNS and CDP documents developed in the Need Phase. During the SE stage, the Business
Owner prepares an SE Package, which further details the approaches presented in the CDP and that addresses the SE stage’s exit criteria to
successfully complete the stage.  The SE Package provides detailed information on the solution concept, the alternatives considered, the
selected alternative, the cost and acquisition approach for the selected alternative, and the PTP.


The SPR and SER are conducted during this stage to ensure the solution set is based on robust analysis and engineering, reflects the best value
approach among alternatives, and accurately portrays the life cycle costs among other criteria.  Collaboration among stakeholders is encouraged
during documentation development as stakeholder endorsement is a prerequisite for USCIS CIO approval at the SER—the final review for the SE
stage.  Business Owners should coordinate with stakeholders and obtain document approvals prior to stage reviews.  The stage review is the forum
where stakeholders provide a final endorsement of the solution set.  Contact the EPMO for assistance if there are questions regarding the
development of a document or the designated stakeholder responsible for review and approval of a particular document.


Document requirements for Level 1 and 2 programs/projects will generally include the full range of documents as prescribed by DHS in the AD 102-
01-001, Appendix B.  While some document tailoring is allowed, Level 1 and 2 programs/projects require in-depth analysis that leaves little
opportunity for tailoring.  Document requirements for Level 3 projects will be determined by the scope, complexity, risk, and cost of the
investment or enhancement/change and tailored as appropriate.  The PTP will be used to document project tailoring for all program/project
levels. [9]


During the SE stage, the SE Checklist is used as a tool to help identify required artifacts and, for smaller projects.  A template for the SE
Checklist is available on the USCIS ITDL.  Please contact the EPMO for questions regarding access to the checklist or for help in preparing the
checklist.


1 Requirements for Study Plan Review


Requirements for the SPR include a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Study Plan.  The CONOPS describes the
operational view of a proposed solution from a user’s perspective.  It describes operational processes, roles and responsibilities, and
sometimes scenarios, illustrating the overall concept for a solution. The AoA Study Plan guides the AoA.  It sets assumptions, bounds, and
constraints on the AoA.  The purpose of the Study Plan is to ensure an unbiased exploration of a broad range of feasible alternatives for
selecting to most viable solution.


The focus of the SPR is to review the initial study plan assumptions, and the scope and methods of analysis.  In some cases, the SPR can be
combined with the SER for Level 3 projects.  Level 3 projects that are qualified to follow an established work pattern for minor or simple
releases do not require SPR or SER.  Requests to combine the SPR with the SER should be discussed during the kickoff meeting.  Once approved,
the project teams can proceed to schedule a single meeting for both gate reviews.  Exhibit 3.4 lists the artifact requirements for the SPR.

Exhibit 3.6 lists the suggested participants for the SPR and SER.  Because acquisitions have different characteristics, additional subject
matter experts (e.g., architecture, test and evaluation, data, contracting, budget, infrastructure, etc.) may be needed for specific expertise.
The EPMO will coordinate to ensure that the appropriate participants are invited to all review meetings.








      5 Planning

The SELC Review for the Planning stage, the Project Planning Review (PPR), is held at the completion of the Planning Stage and ensures that
project resources, activities, schedules, and tools are allocated and baselined and that the exit criteria have been met prior to advancing to
Stage 2, Requirements Definition. As shown in Exhibit 3.7, Planning is named as Stage 1 of the SELC.  This phase of the process ends with a PPR
in place of the ITLM Planning Review.

                                                        Exhibit 3.7 – Planning in the SELC


                                                                      [pic]


1 Explain the Planning Stage of the SELC


According to the DHS Acquisition Instruction/Guidebook:


The purpose of the Planning Stage is to validate that sufficient analysis and planning have been conducted to begin the project.  All facets of
the project are analyzed to ensure that the cost, scope, and schedule are technically feasible and acceptable to stakeholders.  This includes
but is not limited to creating a project plan for the development of the proposed capability that addresses the stated business need.  At the
end of the Planning Stage, the project team and stakeholders should have a comprehensive project management plan . . . that includes an
integrated schedule for development and cost estimates.


2 What are the requirements for this stage?


Most of the requirements listed here were requirements in the ITLM.  The documentation requirements for this phase are listed in Exhibit 3.7.

      APpendix d – Acquisition and Investment Management Life Cycle with EA & SELC





[pic]






      APpendix E – SELC Life Cycle Overview


[pic]

-----------------------

[1]  The Component Acquisition Executive (CAE) is responsible for Component Level 3 acquisitions and establishing Component Level 3 acquisition
 policies and procedures that support the spirit and intent of the DHS SELC (DHS Acquisition Directive 102-01, Section VI – Roles and
 Responsibilities). For additional guidance on DHS SELC requirements, reference the DHS Acquisition Instruction/Guidebook 102-01-001.


[2]  With the migration to the USCIS SELC, entry to the SELC occurs through the USCIS Acquisition and Investment Management process Need Phase
 or an IT Service Request (ITSR), depending on the level of investment.  This phase is followed in the SELC by the Solution Engineering (SE)
 Stage.  The SE stage is a new stage in the life cycle with no equivalent phase in the ITLM.


[3]  A larger version of this diagram can be found in Appendix C – SELC Gates overlaid on Version 2.0 of
 the ITLM.


[4]  The DHS SELC does not include a Disposition Review.  The USCIS SELC adds this review to the Disposition Stage of the life cycle.


[5]  DHS Acquisition Instruction/Guidebook 102-01-0001, Appendix B, page B2.


[6]   Hardware or software approved in the Technical Reference Model that can be ordered under a Blanket Purchase Agreement within the
  Simplified Acquisition Threshold.


[7]  Requirements are subject to change; refer to the USCIS PTP template for the latest document requirements.


[8]   The MNS is introduced in the Needs Phase and finalized in the Analyze/Select Phase.


[9]  Reference Appendix E for full range of possible document requirements for SELC Stage Reviews.

B.    Statement of work (SOW)

1.0   Title of Project

USCIS, Office of Human Capital and Training Workers’ Compensation Claims Management System (WCCMS).

2.0   Project Background

The Office of Human Capital and Training (HCT) provides oversight and management for the overall USCIS Workers' Compensation Program.
Currently, the DHS Headquarters’(HQ) Program Manager is responsible for the oversight of approximately 100 collateral duty employees serving in
the capacity as the Workers’ Compensation Program (WCP) Coordinators in HQ and field locations. The WCP Coordinators, through the guidance of
the Program Manager, are responsible for ensuring timely filing, processing and payment of claims for injured employee’s as well as case
management of injured workers claims.

On July 19, 2010, President Obama established a four-year Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring Reemployment (POWER) Initiative, covering fiscal
years 2011 through 2014.  POWER sets minimum goals to help agencies improve safety and health; encourages agencies to take proactive measures
and focus on prevention and worker support.  The POWER Initiative will extend prior workplace safety and health efforts of the Federal
Government by setting more aggressive performance targets, encouraging the collection and analysis of data on the causes and consequences of
frequent or severe injury and illness, and prioritizing safety and health management programs in the areas of total case rates for injuries/
illnesses; reduction of case rates for lost time injuries/illnesses; increase in the timely filing of injury/illness notices; and reduction of
the rates of lost production days due to injuries/illnesses.

Currently, the processing, analyzing, compiling and generating of reports is performed manually at USCIS and there is no mechanism in place to
conduct effective case management.  The collection and compilation of claim data in order to generate a report for the Department of Homeland
Security and USCIS Senior Management Official’s annual reporting requirements is not easily accessible or obtainable for WCP personnel.  Without
real-time data, USCIS is unable to effectively identify and track trends to make an analysis of workplace injuries and illnesses.

A web-based case management system will contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of the Workers’ Compensation Program by:
      • eliminating manual filing by injured employee, supervisor/manager and WCP coordinator,
      • enabling electronic submissions and processing of illness/injury claims which will reduce the delay in claim processing and case
        management,
      • increasing timely filing from 14 days to 24 hours for claim submission to the Department of Labor,
      • expediting the start of workers compensation benefits for injured employees, and
      • assisting in the return to work process.

The system shall provide a case management feature that will allow worker compensation personnel access to real-time injury/illness claim data
specific to their location for purposes of:
 • compiling and generating reports to meet annual reporting requirements,
 • identifying and tracking trends to make an analysis of workplace injuries and illnesses,
 • providing status on day-to-day activity to allow effective case management, and
 • allowing the WCP Manager access to USCIS-wide claims data to allow  program oversight.

In the interests of providing high-quality service and continuing USCIS’ commitment to improving workplace safety and health conditions for
employees as well as reducing the financial cost to the Agency, USCIS should devote the time and effort necessary to ensure timely filing,
processing and payment of claims of injured employees.  The  automated system shall provide:

    • An agency-wide centralized data and automated processing system that can be used to develop and refine strategies to reduce the risk of
      illness and injury for USCIS employees as well as the associated cost to the Agency,
    • Centralized submission and management of workers’ compensation claims in compliance with the Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA,
    • A web based system designed to support improvements in collection and processing of compensation claims as well as allow expansion of the
      scope of data being collected, tracked and reported,  and
    • Case management and report features to meet Departmental and USCIS established reporting requirements as well as accomplish the mandated
      Presidential POWER goals described above.

11.0  Security Requirements


GENERAL


U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) has determined that performance of this contract requires that the Contractor, subcontractor(s),
vendor(s), etc. (herein known as Contractor), requires access to sensitive but unclassified information, and that the Contractor will adhere to
the following.


SUITABILITY DETERMINATION


USCIS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating access to government facilities and/or access of
Contractor employees to sensitive but unclassified information, based upon the results of a background investigation.  USCIS may, as it deems
appropriate, authorize and make a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks.  The favorable EOD decision would
allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation.  The granting of a favorable EOD decision
shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof. The granting of a
favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of
any such access by USCIS, at any time during the term of the contract.  No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a
USCIS facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Office of Security and Integrity (OSI).


BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS


Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, needing access to sensitive but
unclassified information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties, outlined in the Position Designation Determination
(PDD) for Contractor Personnel, each individual will perform on the contract.  The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify
the appropriate background investigation to be conducted.  All background investigations will be processed through OSI.  Prospective Contractor
employees shall submit the following completed forms to OSI through the COTR no less than 30 days before the starting date of the contract or 30
days prior to entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor:

        1. Standard Form 85P, “Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions”


        2. DHS Form 11000-6, “Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement”

        3. FD Form 258, “Fingerprint Card”  (2 copies)


        4. Form DHS-11000-9, “Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act”

        5. Position Designation Determination for Contract Personnel Form

        6. Foreign National Relatives or Associates Statement

Required forms will be provided by USCIS at the time of award of the contract.  Only complete packages will be accepted by OSI.  Specific
instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of the contract.

Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive but unclassified information has resided in the US for three of the past five
years, OSI may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation.  In such cases, USCIS retains the right to deem an applicant as
ineligible due to insufficient background information.

The use of Non-U.S. citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this contract for any position
that involves access to or development of any DHS IT system.  USCIS will consider only U.S. Citizens for employment on this contract.  USCIS
will not approve LPRs for employment on this contract in any position that requires the LPR to access or assist in the development, operation,
management or maintenance of DHS IT systems.  By signing this contract, the contractor agrees to this restriction.  In those instances where
other non-IT requirements contained in the contract can be met by using LPRs, those requirements shall be clearly described.


EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY


The Contractor must agree that each employee working on this contract will have a Social Security Card issued and approved by the Social
Security Administration.  The Contractor shall be responsible to USCIS for acts and omissions of his own employees and for any Subcontractor(s)
and their employees to include financial responsibility for all damage or injury to persons or property resulting from the acts or omissions of
the contractor's employees.

Subject to existing law, regulations and/ or other provisions of this contract, illegal or undocumented aliens will not be employed by the
Contractor, or with this contract.  The Contractor will ensure that this provision is expressly incorporated into any and all Subcontracts or
subordinate agreements issued in support of this contract.


CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY


If a prospective employee is found to be ineligible for access to USCIS facilities or information, the COTR will advise the Contractor that the
employee shall not continue to work or to be assigned to work under the contract.

USCIS reserves the right and prerogative to deny and/ or restrict the facility and information access of any Contractor employee whose actions
are in conflict with the standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635 and 5 CFR 3801, or whom USCIS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive
but unclassified information to which he or she would have access under this contract.

The Contractor will report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to USCIS OSI.  The
subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report.  The report shall include the
employees’ name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.

OSI must be notified of all terminations/ resignations within five days of occurrence.  The Contractor will return any expired USCIS issued
identification cards and building passes, or those of terminated employees to the COTR.  If an identification card or building pass is not
available to be returned, a report must be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued, the
last known location and disposition of the pass or card.


SECURITY MANAGEMENT


The Contractor shall appoint a senior official to act as the Corporate Security Officer.  The individual will interface with OSI through the
COTR on all security matters, to include physical, personnel, and protection of all Government information and data accessed by the Contractor.

The COTR and OSI shall have the right to inspect the procedures, methods, and facilities utilized by the Contractor in complying with the
security requirements under this contract.  Should the COTR determine that the Contractor is not complying with the security requirements of
this contract, the Contractor will be informed in writing by the Contracting Officer of the proper action to be taken in order to effect
compliance with such requirements.

Due to the sensitive nature of USCIS information, the contractor is required to develop and maintain a comprehensive Computer and
Telecommunications Security Program to address the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information
during collection, storage, transmission, and disposal.  The contractor’s security program shall adhere to the requirements set forth in the DHS
Management Directive 4300 IT Systems Security Pub Volume 1 Part A and DHS Management Directive 4300 IT Systems Security Pub Volume I Part B.
This shall include conformance with the DHS Sensitive Systems Handbook, DHS Management Directive 11042 Safeguarding Sensitive but Unclassified
(For Official Use Only) Information and other DHS or USCIS guidelines and directives regarding information security requirements.  The
contractor shall establish a working relationship with the USCIS IT Security Office, headed by the Information Systems Security Program Manager
(ISSM).


                                                               IT SYSTEMS SECURITY

In accordance with DHS Management Directive 4300.1 “Information Technology Systems Security”, USCIS Contractors shall ensure that all employees
with access to USCIS IT Systems are in compliance with the requirement of this Management Directive.  Specifically, all contractor employees
with access to USCIS IT Systems meet the requirement for successfully completing the annual “Computer Security Awareness Training (CSAT).” All
contractor employees are required to complete the training within 60-days from the date of entry on duty (EOD) and are required to complete the
training yearly thereafter.
CSAT can be accessed at the following:  http://otcd.uscis.dhs.gov/EDvantage.Default.asp or via remote access from a CD which can be obtained by
contacting uscisitsecurity@dhs.gov.




                                             IT SECURITY IN THE SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)

The USCIS SDLC Manual documents all system activities required for the development, operation, and disposition of IT security systems.  Required
systems analysis, deliverables, and security activities are identified in the SDLC manual by lifecycle phase.  The contractor shall assist the
appropriate USCIS ISSO with development and completion of all SDLC activities and deliverables contained in the SDLC.  The SDLC is supplemented
with information from DHS and USCIS Policies and procedures as well as the National Institute of Standards Special Procedures related to
computer security and FISMA compliance.  These activities include development of the following documents:
    • Sensitive System Security Plan (SSSP): This is the primary reference that describes system sensitivity, criticality, security controls,
      policies, and procedures.  The SSSP shall be based upon the completion of the DHS FIPS 199 workbook to categorize the system of application
      and completion of the RMS Questionnaire.  The SSSP shall be completed as part of the System or Release Definition Process in the SDLC and
      shall not be waived or tailored.
    • Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and System of Records Notification (SORN).  For each new development activity, each incremental system
      update, or system recertification, a PIA and SORN shall be evaluated.  If the system (or modification) triggers a PIA the contractor shall
      support the development of PIA and SORN as required.  The Privacy Act of 1974 requires the PIA and shall be part of the SDLC process
      performed at either System or Release Definition.
    • Contingency Plan (CP): This plan describes the steps to be taken to ensure that an automated system or facility can be recovered from
      service disruptions in the event of emergencies and/or disasters. The Contractor shall support annual contingency plan testing and shall
      provide a Contingency Plan Test Results Report.
    • Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E):  This document evaluates each security control and countermeasure to verify operation in the manner
      intended.  Test parameters are established based on results of the RA.  An ST&E shall be conducted for each Major Application and each
      General Support System as part of the certification process.  The Contractor shall support this process.
    • Risk Assessment (RA):  This document identifies threats and vulnerabilities, assesses the impacts of the threats, evaluates in-place
      countermeasures, and identifies additional countermeasures necessary to ensure an acceptable level of security.  The RA shall be completed
      after completing the NIST 800-53 evaluation, Contingency Plan Testing, and the ST&E. Identified weakness shall be documented in a Plan of
      Action and Milestone (POA&M) in the USCIS Trusted Agent FISMA (TAF) tool.  Each POA&M entry shall identify the cost of mitigating the
      weakness and the schedule for mitigating the weakness, as well as a POC for the mitigation efforts.
    • Certification and Accreditation (C&A):  This program establishes the extent to which a particular design and implementation of an automated
      system and the facilities housing that system meet a specified set of security requirements, based on the RA of security features and other
      technical requirements (certification), and the management authorization and approval of a system to process sensitive but unclassified
      information (accreditation).  As appropriate the Contractor shall be granted access to the USCIS TAF and Risk Management System (RMS) tools
      to support C&A and its annual assessment requirements.  Annual assessment activities shall include completion of the NIST 800-26 Self
      Assessment in TAF, annual review of user accounts, and annual review of the FIPS categorization.  C&A status shall be reviewed for each
      incremental system update and a new full C&A process completed when a major system revision is anticipated.



                                                               SECURITY ASSURANCES

DHS Management Directives 4300 requires compliance with standards set forth by NIST, for evaluating computer systems used for processing SBU
information.  The Contractor shall ensure that requirements are allocated in the functional requirements and system design documents to security
requirements are based on the DHS policy, NIST standards and applicable legislation and regulatory requirements.  Systems shall offer the
following visible security features:
    • User Identification and Authentication (I&A) – I&A is the process of telling a system the identity of a subject (for example, a user) (I)
      and providing that the subject is who it claims to be (A).  Systems shall be designed so that the identity of each user shall be
      established prior to authorizing system access, each system user shall have his/her own user ID and password, and each user is
      authenticated before access is permitted.  All system and database administrative users shall have strong authentication, with passwords
      that shall conform to established DHS standards.  All USCIS Identification and Authentication shall be done using the Password Issuance
      Control System (PICS) or its successor.  Under no circumstances will Identification and Authentication be performed by other than the USCIS
      standard system in use at the time of a systems development.
    • Discretionary Access Control (DAC) – DAC is a DHS access policy that restricts access to system objects (for example, files, directories,
      devices) based on the identity of the users and/or groups to which they belong.  All system files shall be protected by a secondary access
      control measure.
    • Object Reuse – Object Reuse is the reassignment to a subject (for example, user) of a medium that previously contained an object (for
      example, file).  Systems that use memory to temporarily store user I&A information and any other SBU information shall be cleared before
      reallocation.
    • Audit – DHS systems shall provide facilities for transaction auditing, which is the examination of a set of chronological records that
      provide evidence of system and user activity.  Evidence of active review of audit logs shall be provided to the USCIS IT Security Office on
      a monthly basis, identifying all security findings including failed log in attempts, attempts to access restricted information, and
      password change activity.
    • Banner Pages – DHS systems shall provide appropriate security banners at start up identifying the system or application as being a
      Government asset and subject to government laws and regulations.  This requirement does not apply to public facing internet pages, but
      shall apply to intranet applications.



                                                                  DATA SECURITY

SBU systems shall be protected from unauthorized access, modification, and denial of service.  The Contractor shall ensure that all aspects of
data security requirements (i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability) are included in the functional requirements and system design,
and ensure that they meet the minimum requirements as set forth in the DHS Sensitive Systems Handbook and USCIS policies and procedures.  These
requirements include:
    • Integrity – The computer systems used for processing SBU shall have data integrity controls to ensure that data is not modified
      (intentionally or unintentionally) or repudiated by either the sender or the receiver of the information.  A risk analysis and
      vulnerability assessment shall be performed to determine what type of data integrity controls (e.g., cyclical redundancy checks, message
      authentication codes, security hash functions, and digital signatures, etc.) shall be used.
    • Confidentiality – Controls shall be included to ensure that SBU information collected, stored, and transmitted by the system is protected
      against compromise.  A risk analysis and vulnerability assessment shall be performed to determine if threats to the SBU exist.  If it
      exists, data encryption shall be used to mitigate such threats.
    • Availability – Controls shall be included to ensure that the system is continuously working and all services are fully available within a
      timeframe commensurate with the availability needs of the user community and the criticality of the information processed.
    • Data Labeling. – The contractor shall ensure that documents and media are labeled consistent with the DHS Sensitive Systems Handbook.

HSAR Clauses Incorporated in Full Text:

3052.204-70 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES (JUN 2006)

(a) The Contractor shall be responsible for Information Technology (IT) security for all systems connected to a DHS network or operated by the
Contractor for DHS, regardless of location. This clause applies to all or any part of the contract that includes information technology
resources or services for which the Contractor must have physical or electronic access to sensitive information contained in DHS unclassified
systems that directly support the agency’s mission.
(b) The Contractor shall provide, implement, and maintain an IT Security Plan. This plan shall describe the processes and procedures that will
be followed to ensure appropriate security of IT resources that are developed, processed, or used under this contract.
      (1) Within 30 days after contract award, the contractor shall submit for approval its IT Security Plan, which shall be consistent with and
      further detail the approach contained in the offeror's proposal. The plan, as approved by the Contracting Officer, shall be incorporated
      into the contract as a compliance document.
      (2) The Contractor’s IT Security Plan shall comply with Federal laws that include, but are not limited to, the Computer Security Act of
      1987 (40 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.); the Government Information Security Reform Act of 2000; and the Federal Information Security Management Act
      of 2002; and with Federal policies and procedures that include, but are not limited to, OMB Circular A-130.
      (3) The security plan shall specifically include instructions regarding handling and protecting sensitive information at the Contractor’s
      site (including any information stored, processed, or transmitted using the Contractor’s computer systems), and the secure management,
      operation, maintenance, programming, and system administration of computer systems, networks, and telecommunications systems.
(c) Examples of tasks that require security provisions include--
      (1) Acquisition, transmission or analysis of data owned by DHS with significant replacement cost should the contractor’s copy be corrupted;
      and
      (2) Access to DHS networks or computers at a level beyond that granted the general public (e.g., such as bypassing a firewall).
(d) At the expiration of the contract, the contractor shall return all sensitive DHS information and IT resources provided to the contractor
during the contract, and certify that all non-public DHS information has been purged from any contractor-owned system. Components shall conduct
reviews to ensure that the security requirements in the contract are implemented and enforced.
(e) Within 6 months after contract award, the contractor shall submit written proof of IT Security accreditation to DHS for approval by the DHS
Contracting Officer. Accreditation will proceed according to the criteria of the DHS Sensitive System Policy Publication, 4300A (Version 2.1,
July 26, 2004) or any replacement publication, which the Contracting Officer will provide upon request. This accreditation will include a final
security plan, risk assessment, security test and evaluation, and disaster recovery plan/continuity of operations plan. This accreditation, when
accepted by the Contracting Officer, shall be incorporated into the contract as a compliance document. The contractor shall comply with the
approved accreditation documentation.

                                                                 (End of clause)

3052.204-71 Contractor Employee Access (JUN 2006)
 (a) Sensitive Information, as used in this Chapter, means any information, the loss, misuse, disclosure, or unauthorized access to or
modification of which could adversely affect the national or homeland security interest, or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to
which individuals are entitled under section 552a of title 5, United States Code (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically
authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense,
homeland security or foreign policy. This definition includes the following categories of information:
           (1) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (Title II,
           Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto
           (Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 29) as amended, the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and any supplementary
           guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager
           or his/her designee);
           (2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, “Policies and
           Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of S SI,” as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized
           official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or
           his/her designee);
           (3) Information designated as “For Official Use Only,” which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized
           disclosure of which could adversely impact a person’s privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or
           operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and
           (4) Any information that is designated “sensitive” or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with
           subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures.
(b) “Information Technology Resources” include, but are not limited to, computer equipment, networking equipment, telecommunications equipment,
cabling, network drives, computer drives, network software, computer software, software programs, intranet sites, and internet sites.
(c) Contractor employees working on this contract must complete such forms as may be necessary for security or other reasons, including the
conduct of background investigations to determine suitability. Completed forms shall be submitted as directed by the Contracting Officer. Upon
the Contracting Officer's request, the Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted, or subject to other investigations as required. All
contractor employees requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information or IT resources are required to have
a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract unless this requirement is waived under Departmental
procedures.
(d) The Contracting Officer may require the contractor to prohibit individuals from working on the contract if the government deems their
initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to, carelessness, insubordination,
incompetence, or security concerns.
(e) Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information. Therefore, the Contractor shall not disclose, orally or in writing,
any sensitive information to any person unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. For those contractor employees authorized
access to sensitive information, the contractor shall ensure that these persons receive training concerning the protection and disclosure of
sensitive information both during and after contract performance.
(f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts at any tier where the subcontractor may have access to
Government facilities, sensitive information, or resources.
                                                                 (End of clause)

Note:  Contractors requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive but unclassified information and/or logical access
to 1nfonnation Technology (IT) resources shall verify minimal fitness requirements for all persons/candidates designated for employment under
any Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contract by prescreening the person/candidate prior to submitting their name for consideration to work
on the contract. Pre-screening the candidate ensures that minimum fitness requirements are considered and mitigates the burden of DHS having to
conduct background investigations on objectionable candidates. The Contractor shall submit only those candidates that have not had a felony
conviction within the past 36 months, illegal drug use within the past 12 months., or misconduct such as criminal activity on the job relating
to fraud or theft within the past 12 months from the date of submission of their name as a candidate to perform work under this contract. Pre-
screening shall be conducted within 15 days after contract award. The fitness determination does not impact the candidate's fitness for
employment with your firm on other assignments unrelated to this contract.

This requirement shall be placed in all subcontracts if the subcontractor requires routine physical access, access to sensitive but unclassified
information, and/or logical access to IT resources. Failure to comply with the pre-screening requirement will result in the Contracting Officer
taking the appropriate remedy (i.e., recording non-compliance into the Past Performance Database, contract termination).

3052.204-71 Contractor Employee Access  ALTERNATE I (JUN 2006)

(g) Before receiving access to IT resources under this contract the individual must receive a security briefing, which the Contracting Officer’s
Technical Representative (COTR) will arrange, and complete any nondisclosure agreement furnished by DHS.

(h) The contractor shall have access only to those areas of DHS information technology resources explicitly stated in this contract or approved
by the COTR in writing as necessary for performance of the work under this contract. Any attempts by contractor personnel to gain access to any
information technology resources not expressly authorized by the statement of work, other terms and conditions in this contract, or as approved
in writing by the COTR, is strictly prohibited. In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate actions with regard to
the contract and the individual(s) involved.

      (i) Contractor access to DHS networks from a remote location is a temporary privilege for mutual convenience while the contractor performs
      business for the DHS Component. It is not a right, a guarantee of access, a condition of the contract, or Government Furnished Equipment
      (GFE).

(j) Contractor access will be terminated for unauthorized use. The contractor agrees to hold and save DHS harmless from any unauthorized use and
agrees not to request additional time or money under the contract for any delays resulting from unauthorized use or access.

(k) Non-U.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department IT
systems under the contract, unless a waiver has been granted by the Head of the Component or designee, with the concurrence of both the
Department’s Chief Security Officer (CSO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or their designees. Within DHS Headquarters, the waiver may be
granted only with the approval of both the CSO and the CIO or their designees. In order for a waiver to be granted:

      (1) The individual must be a legal permanent resident of the U. S. or a citizen of Ireland, Israel, the Republic of the Philippines, or any
      nation on the Allied Nations List maintained by the Department of State;
      (2) There must be a compelling reason for using this individual as opposed to a
      U. S. citizen; and
      (3) The waiver must be in the best interest of the Government.

(l) Contractors shall identify in their quotations the names and citizenship of all non-U.S. citizens proposed to work under the contract.  Any
additions or deletions of non-U.S. citizens after task order award shall also be reported to the contracting officer.

                                                                 (End of clause)

3052.209-73 LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (JUN 2006)

(a) The Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition may give rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest. Accordingly,
the attention of prospective Offerors is invited to FAR Subpart 9.5--Organizational Conflicts of Interest.

(b) The nature of this conflict is based on the premise that contractors who provide USCIS Services in a Program Management Support or
Consulting capacity such as providing Business Process Reengineering Support may give rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest on
contracts where the contractor is providing services in an operational support capacity.  Services provided in a Program Management or
Consulting capacity may have a direct impact on contracts of an operational support nature.  Likewise, services performed on the operational
support contract could impair a contractor’s capacity to provide impartial advice on the Program Management Support or Consulting Services
contract.  These conflicting roles could result in the inability to render impartial or objective assistance or bias a contractor’s judgment
resulting in an impaired objectivity Organizational Conflict of Interest.

(c) The restrictions upon future contracting are as follows:


      (1) If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through the performance of tasks pursuant to this contract, is required to
      develop specifications or statements of work, budget projections and/or cost estimates that are to be incorporated into a solicitation, the
      Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described in that solicitation as a prime or first-tier subcontractor under an ensuing
      DHS contract. This restriction shall remain in effect for a reasonable time, as agreed to by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor,
      sufficient to avoid unfair competitive advantage or potential bias (this time shall in no case be less than the duration of the initial
      production contract). DHS shall not unilaterally require the Contractor to prepare such specifications or statements of work under this
      contract.

      (2) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary, business confidential, or financial data of other
      companies, and as long as these data remain proprietary or confidential, the Contractor shall protect these data from unauthorized use and
      disclosure and agrees not to use them to compete with those other companies.  Contractor employees shall sign a DHS Form 11000-6, Non-
      Disclosure Agreement.

                                                                 (End of clause)

All press releases or announcements about agency programs, projects, and contract awards need to be cleared by the Program Office and the

services, or equipment furnished pursuant to the provisions of this contract in any publicity news release or commercial advertising without
first obtaining explicit written consent to do so from the Program Office and the Contracting Officer.

The Contractor agrees not to refer to awards in commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the product or service
provided is endorsed or preferred by the Federal Government or is considered by the Government to be superior to other products or services.

necessary, discussions will be conducted with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range.  If the
Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an
efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest
number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  Therefore, the Offeror’s initial proposal should
contain the Offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The Government reserves the right to request Other than cost or pricing data.


Section II – Past Performance

The offeror shall provide relevant past performance information for a minimum of (3) but not more than (5) projects performed within the last
three (3) years.  In addition, the offeror shall submit a minimum of (3) but not more than (5) references for those subcontractors who are

critical to overall successful performance.  This information shall consist of a one (1) page introductory matrix listing the offerors and its
major or critical subcontractors’ past performance.

The offeror should include rationale supporting the assertion of relevance for each reference.

Past performance may cite federal, state, local government, commercial sources, or not for profit sources and should highlight the company’s key
role in the past performance being documented.  These references should also be from different contracts.  To be considered, past performance
data may not be older than three (3) years from the date of the proposal, and may include active contracts.  Recent past performance is defined
as within the past three years.  If some of the offeror’s (and major subcontractors’) past performance is relevant and the rest is not, only the
relevant past performance will be evaluated for purposes of past performance.  If the offeror has no relevant past performance, the offeror
shall certify to the CO the offeror has no past performance.  Further, offerors should include a list of all relevant DHS on-going contracts or
contracts completed for the specified period.

      • Actual completion date
      • Contact names, addresses, telephone numbers, Fax numbers and e-mail addresses of current, or last (if contract completed) Program

Past performance references shall be as a prime contractor or first-tier subcontractor on previous or current projects/tasks that are similar in
size, scope, and complexity to the work identified in the Statement of Work.  Past performance does not necessarily have to be Government-
related; but it is important to demonstrate and provide evidence of past performance for work similar in size, scope and complexity to that
described in the Request for Proposal.  The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions implemented to overcome problems and
the effects of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems solved.  Evidence of performance-based methodologies in past
performance shall be provided where available.

      The offeror shall also be responsible for ensuring that each of the customer references receives and completes the Past Performance
      Questionnaire (see page 57) which shall be e-mailed to Richard.w.march@uscis.dhs.gov or Kristie.nestle@dhs.gov by the time and date the
      proposals are due.


      The Government reserves the right to use publicly available reports and data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)
      found on the web at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The Government may also use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of

Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Provisions

The full text of HSAR provisions may be accessed electronically at the following address:


                                                      http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFHSAR1.HTM

HSAR 3052.209-72 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (JUN 2006)

(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one
or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on
future contracting is described below:

The nature of this conflict is based on the premise that contractors who provide USCIS Services in a Program Management Support or Consulting
capacity such as developing USCIS specific business requirements & providing impact analysis may give rise to a potential organizational
conflict of interest on contracts where the contractor is providing services in an operational support capacity.  Services provided in a Program
Management or Consulting capacity may have a direct impact on contracts of an operational support nature.  Likewise, services performed on the
operational support contract could impair a contractor’s capacity to provide impartial advice on the Program Management Support or Consulting
Services contract.  These conflicting roles could result in the inability to render impartial or objective assistance or bias a contractor’s
judgment resulting in an impaired objectivity Organizational Conflict of Interest.

(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is
otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize,
mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the
actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be
found ineligible for award.

(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:

      ___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of
      this contract, or
      ___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential
      organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.


(d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be
avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual
or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved,
the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.

(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the
offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to
determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.

(f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of
any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.


(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition
threshold.

                                                                (End of provision)

note: Please refer back to HSAR 3052.209-73.


SECTION V – Proposal Evaluation

52.216-1 Type of Contract (APR 1984)

The Government contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract with labor hour CLINs in the Base Period resulting from this solicitation.
                                                                (End of provision)


52.217-5 EVALUATION of Options (JUL 1990)


Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government’s best interests, the Government will evaluate offers
for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Evaluation of options will not
obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
                                                                (End of Provision)

52.233-2  Service of Protest (Sept 2006)
  (a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any
protests that are filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by
obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from kristie.nestle@dhs.gov, Contractong Officer.
  (b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO.
                                                                (End of provision)

Basis of Award

The Government will award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation
and represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors listed herein, using the trade-off process.  The best value
determination is performed by the Contracting Officer and will be made by comparing the differences (strengths, weaknesses, and risks) of each
proposal.

Each proposal shall be evaluated against the following factors:

Factor 1 - Technical Approach
Factor 2 - Past Performance
Factor 3 - Price

The Factors are in descending order of importance.  When Factor 1 Technical Approach and
Factor 2 Past Performance are combined they are significantly more important than Factor 3 Price.


Technical Approach - Factor 1


   1. The offeror’s technical approach shall describe the offerors solution to meeting the requirements of the SOW and SOW Attachment A.
   2. Attachment A shows an asterisk for items that are more important.  Attachment A shows columns for “Meets” and “Does not Meet”.  Offerors
      shall check the column “Meets” or “Does not Meet” that applies to their proposed solution.  “Meets” means that the offeror’s solution
      contains the requirement and that no modification of the contractor’s software is necessary to satisfy the SOW requirements.  “Does not
      Meet” means that the offeror would have to modify their software to satisfy the SOW requirements.  Offerors that have more items checked
      “Meets”, including those with an asterisk, will be rated higher than offeror’s having more items checked “Does not Meet”.  For each item
      checked “Does not Meet”, offeror’s shall clearly describe and explain the reasons why the offeror’s proposed solution does not satisfy the
      SOW requirements.

Past Performance Factor - Factor 2

While good past performance does not always assure good prospective performance and vice versa, past performance is nonetheless an indicator of
future performance.

A risk assessment will be made of an offeror’s potential performance based on the offeror’s and major subcontractors’ (25% of overall contract
value) past performance.  Past performance evaluation will consider whether the offeror’s (and major subcontractors’) past performance is
similar to this acquisition in size, scope and complexity, whether the reports show a pattern of consistency in past performance, timeliness of
deliveries or performance, quality of performance, cost control, and contractor responsibility.

The evaluation may include past performance on other DHS contracts, past performance information on contracts with other Government agencies or
private industry, and Contractor Past Performance Survey Questionnaires.  The evaluation may also include data provided through the Past
Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or other sources other than those identified by the offeror.

This evaluation factor will be rated using the following adjectival ratings:  Low Risk/Outstanding, Medium Risk/Good, High Risk/ Unacceptable,
and Neutral.  An offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will receive
a rating of Neutral.  A Neutral rating does not advantage or disadvantage an offeror.

Recent past performance is defined as within the past three years.  If some of the offeror’s (and major subcontractors’) past performance is
relevant and the rest is not, only the relevant past performance will be evaluated for purposes of past performance.

If the offeror has no relevant past performance, the offeror shall certify to the CO the offeror has no past performance.

Price Factor - Factor 3

The Price Factor will be evaluated along with other business aspects of the price proposal.  The purpose of conducting a price proposal
evaluation is to assess the reasonableness of the proposed price, including all options, and to assess the acceptability of the other business
matters of the proposal.  The results of the price proposal evaluation shall also be used as an aid in determining each offeror’s understanding
of the requirements of the solicitation.

The offeror’s proposed software prices, travel detail, proposed labor rates and labor classifications will be compared to prices proposed by
other offerors, to offeror or any publically available, or to data available to USCIS for comparable effort.  The proposed price will be
evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with one or more price analysis techniques as identified in FAR 15.404.  Any proposal that is
unreasonable or materially unbalanced as to price for base or option line items may be rejected.  An unbalanced proposal is one that
incorporates prices that are significantly understated or overstated as indicated by price analysis techniques.

The offers will be evaluated by summing the total price of the base year with the total price of each option year as well as the option
entertained by FAR 52.217-8.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

Prior to conducting the price analysis, each price proposed will be examined for arithmetic accuracy and consistency of the information
presented in the pricing schedule.

The price analysis will also include other areas of the offeror’s business proposal to make sure it complies with the instructions provided in
the RFP instructions.

simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
principals—
    (1) _ Are, _ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;
    (2) _ Have, _ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property;
    (3) _ Are, _ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) _ Have, _ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,
this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or
indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those
efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
  (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to
this solicitation is predominantly—

  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used
for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—

Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
