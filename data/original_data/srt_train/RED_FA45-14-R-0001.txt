____________________________________________________________________________________ ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.81 per hour or $152.40 per week or $660.40 per month VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds

http://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/05-2309.txt?v=13

Page 8 of 10

$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage

determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent

information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

INTRODUCTION


1 Background


The Air Mobility Command (AMC) is responsible to the National Command Authority (NCA) through the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and the United
States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) for the planning and execution of global airlift and aerial refueling missions during peace, crisis,
and war.  AMC is also responsible for the coordination and exercise of airlift and air refueling strategy, doctrine, and plans under the
direction of USTRANSCOM.  Crisis and wartime support are provided to the unified and specified commands.  As an Air Force (AF) Major Command
(MAJCOM), AMC is responsible to the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff, Headquarters (HQ) United States Air Force (USAF), for the
accomplishment of peacetime airlift and air refueling services in a manner that will promote the emergency and wartime capability of assigned
forces and ensure the support of all Department of Defense (DoD) components.  In addition, AMC is also responsible for aero medical evacuation
operation.

AMC supports the Mobility Air Force mission--"Global Reach."  It is difficult, if not impossible, for United States military forces to deploy
rapidly or be supported effectively during employment without the assets and expertise provided by AMC.  AMC Command and Control (C2), In-
Transit Visibility (ITV), and Business Systems (hereafter referred to as “Systems”) processes, procedures, and services must be consistent and
reliable in peacetime, during contingencies, and throughout the full spectrum of war.  Therefore, the information technology (IT) resources
enabling the efficient and effective management of this capability must also provide these services at the highest levels of availability,
integrity, and confidentiality.

The 375th Communication Support Squadron (CSPTS) provides command and control, communications, and computer (C4) support to DoD, USTRANSCOM,
AMC, and worldwide aerial and water ports.  The 375th CSPTS also operates and maintains the Systems supporting the 618th Air & Space Operations
Center, Tanker Airlift Control Center (618th  AOC/TACC) global mission.  The 375th CSPTS, augmented by a contractor providing Communications,
Operations, and Maintenance Functions (COM-F) services, is AMC’s answer to meeting the challenges of providing operational support and
maintenance of the Systems hardware in a timely, effective, and efficient manner.

Along with Government developed applications, examples of software and appliances currently under the purview of the Systems include:
    • Sybase Database Management Software and High Availability (HA)
    • Oracle Database Management Software
    • Oracle Applications Software
    • Microsoft Structured Query Language (SQL) Server
    • Windows Operating Systems
    • Microsoft Active Directory
    • UNIX / Red Hat Enterprise Linux Operating Systems
    • UNIX / Solaris Operating Systems
    • VMWare
    • SharePlex
    • NetIQ
    • SharePoint
    • Internet Information Server
    • Apache Web Server
    • CISCO
    • F5
    • Citrix
    • Altiris
    • Symantec & McAfee

The Systems are in a constant state of change as hardware is replaced/upgraded, software versions and patches are fielded, and the entire
computing and network environments evolve from a thick/thin client, system centric client server environment to an Infrastructure as a Service
(IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) construct.  AMC has begun implementing hardware and software in the enclave environment to support
virtualized operations.  This process will continue as systems and applications capable of operating in virtualized environments are fielded.
The entire operation will evolve over time from a system-centric perspective to an enterprise perspective, with a large proportion of the
workload shifting to managing the virtual environment.


2 Scope


The scope of the contract is for a contractor to provide all the resources in staffing and management necessary to meet the performance
standards of the performance work statement (PWS), the Systems Availability Thresholds (Appendix 1), systems Original Equipment Manufacturer
(OEM) maintenance standards, and the System operational reporting criteria.

The scope of the contract includes systems for which operations and maintenance (O&M) support is provided by 375th CSPTS and/or systems that
reside on the MAF C2 Enclaves.  The supported Systems currently include the following:

    • Advanced Computer Flight Plan (ACFP)
    • Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS)
    • Commercial Operations Integrated System (COINS)
    • Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES)
    • Global Command and Control System (GCCS)
    • Global Decision Support System (GDSS)
    • Mobility Enterprise Information Services (MEIS)
    • Mobility Air Forces (MAF) C2 Enclaves and Enterprise Services
    • Trouble Ticket Tracking System (TTTS) (currently “Remedy”)
    • Mobility Operations Application-Based System (MOABS) (trouble ticket logging only)

Specifically, the support services are for the Systems production environment.  The production environment is the software, hardware,
appliances, and other products placed into operation for use by end users.  It includes virtual machines and virtual infrastructure.
“Production environments” in this context include exercise and training environments but do not include test or development environments.  It
also includes all sub-systems, modules, and applications within the Systems and all future modifications, modernizations and projects of the
Systems.  The support services are provided by individuals having the required expertise and experience on the supported systems.

MISSION ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL


Certain personnel providing services under this contract may be designated as Mission Essential Personnel.  Contractor shall ensure personnel
required to accomplish tasks designated as Mission Essential Personnel report to assigned work locations and perform required tasks, regardless
of weather or security conditions.  The government has identified the System Administration, Network Administration, Database Administration,
and Help Desk tasks within the PWS as Mission Essential.  The contractor shall provide a list of essential personnel required to perform the
tasks to CO and COR no later than 10 working days after contract start.  This list will be maintained by the contractor with updates provided to
the CO and COR with any personnel changes or as required.  The CO and/or COR will be responsible for providing government security personnel
with list of contractor Mission Essential Personnel to enable access to government facilities when non-essential personnel are barred.
Contractor shall operate in accordance with DoDI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DoD Contractor Services During Crisis.  Mission Essential
Personnel are personnel allowed to enter Scott AFB during periods of restricted access as designated by the Base Commander.








ADDITIONAL COSTS


1 Travel Expense Reimbursement


The Contractor may be required to travel worldwide in the performance of this PWS.  At least five working days prior to the travel start date,
the Contractor shall submit a travel itinerary and estimated cost to the COR and CO.  The COR will confirm the need for travel, and the CO will
confirm the availability of funds.     If any travel arrangements cause additional costs that exceed those previously approved, written approval
by the CO is required, prior to undertaking such travel.  The Government shall reimburse the Contractor for other than local travel expenses in
accordance with the FAR 31.205-46.

1 Travel Reimbursement


Travel expenses shall be reimbursed on an actual cost basis.  Airfare shall be the prevailing rates for commercial airlines at economy class.
The most reasonable means of ground transportation (i.e. taxi, bus, rental car) shall also be used.  Should the Contractor encounter extenuating
circumstances warranting the need to purchase a fully refundable/fully reimbursable airfare, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from
the COR.  The Contractor must be prepared to justify the more costly means of travel.  Travel costs shall be reimbursed in accordance with FAR
31.205-46.

Instances in which the non-refundable airfare is not used for the intended date and/or trip, the Contractor should pursue changing the airfare
with the air carrier upon COR approval.  The Government will pay the Contractor for the change fees in an amount that is justified and
reasonable. In circumstances where it is not possible or practical for the person initially named to travel to do so, and the Contractor cannot
reuse the ticket, the Government, upon providing the COR with documentation supporting the Contractor’s due diligence in attempting to re-use
the airfare, will reimburse the Contractor the full price of the non-refundable airfare.

The Government will not reimburse local travel and related expenses to the Contractor.  Local travel is defined as any travel 50 miles or less
one-way from Scott AFB, IL.

2 OTHER DIRECT COSTS (ODC)





The Government will reimburse the Contractor, as an ODC, those costs incurred by the Contractor for the purchase of Government-approved
equipment, licensing, and spare parts.  All non-consumable equipment and supplies billed to the Government as ODC shall be maintained, accounted
for, and disposed of in accordance with the directions provided by the COR.


The Government will not reimburse the Contractor for consumables.  The Contractor will provide all consumable materials.  These materials are
those items that are not reusable by the Government after initial use.  Examples of materials that fall within this area include paper, pens,
pencils, markers, tape, staples, tacks, toner cartridges, disks, binders, etc.


ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATION


1 Points of Contact


1 Contracting Office


Name, address, and phone number of the CO will be provided at time of award and as otherwise deemed necessary by the Contracting Office.


2 Contracting Officer Representative (COR)


Name, address, and phone numbers of the COR and Alternate COR will be provided at time of award and as otherwise deemed necessary by the
Contracting Office.


TRANSITION


1 Phase-in


To minimize any decreases in productivity and to prevent possible negative impacts on additional services, the Contractor shall have personnel
employed in each Functional Area (FA), during the 90 day phase in period.  During the phase in period, the Contractor shall become familiar with
performance requirements in order to commence full performance of services on the contract start date.  During phase-in, the Government will
physically transfer all Government-provided equipment, materials, property and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products to the incoming
Contractor for which at this point forward, the Contractor shall account for and maintain.


1 Phase-In Plan


The Contractor shall submit a phase-in/transition plan (A003) with their proposal for acceptance  by  the  Government.   The  first  30  days  of
performance may be used by the Contractor as an observation and familiarization period.  The plan shall include as a minimum  phase-in  schedule,
key personnel positions, employees, and approach to the transition from incumbent Contractor to successor Contractor for the performance of  this
PWS.  On contract start date and thereafter, as a minimum, staffing shall be available in each Function Area  (FA)  to  observe,  interface,  and
work with the incumbent work-force.  All transition actions must be completed NLT the 90th day following contract start date.

The new Contractor shall provide qualified personnel to fully staff each FA as soon as possible in order to ensure necessary network and system
accounts are in place and knowledge is transferred from the incumbent Contractor. The new Contractor shall accomplish all the responsibilities
of the work area without the aid of the incumbent Contractor work-force within 90 days after contract start date.  If the successor Contractor’s
phase-in plan can achieve efficiencies by accelerating or accepting responsibility for work areas ahead of the proposed schedule, inform the COR
for approval to proceed.  This transition/incremental assumption data and schedule shall be included in the successor Contractor’s phase-in
plan.

The Contractor shall jointly work with and assume responsibility from the incumbent work-force to ensure continuity of operations.  The
incumbent Contractor retains responsibility for work performed in each FA until the end of the transition period.  At no time will employees
from one Contractor act in a supervisory capacity over the other Contractor’s employees.  The expectation is that the incumbent Contractor phase-
out work-force will work closely with the new Contractor to identify and explain any unique aspects of the Systems.


2 Phase-out


When there is a change in contractor upon award of a new contract there will be a phase-out period associated with the transfer of
responsibility, records, and data by the incumbent.  Not later than 6 months prior to the end of the contract or as directed by the COR, the
Contractor will provide the Government with a phase-out/transition plan (A003).  The phase-out plan will detail how all taskings will be
transferred to the successor.  The phase-out plan will be submitted for COR review and approval.

The incumbent and successor contractors shall cooperate during phase-out orientation that will begin immediately after follow-on contract award
or whenever the CO directs the changeover.  The incumbent Contractor retains responsibility for work performed in each FA until the end of the
transition period.  At no time will employees from one Contractor act in a supervisory capacity over the other Contractor’s employees.  The
expectation is that the incumbent Contractor phase-out work-force will work closely with the new Contractor to identify and explain any unique
aspects of the Systems.
The incumbent Contractor is responsible for protecting Government Intellectual Property.  The Contractor shall provide a current inventory list,
notate any discrepancies, complete all necessary documentation, and physically transfer all materials, property, and COTS to the Government
prior to end of contract.


Contractor Manpower Reporting Language for Contract Performance Work Statements


The contractor shall report all contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under
this contract via the Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (CMRA), a secure data collection site.  The contractor is required to completely
fill in all required data fields at http://www.ecmra.mil.

Reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of performance for each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs 1 October
through 30 September.  While inputs may be reported any time during the FY, all data shall be reported no later than 31 October of each calendar
year.  Contractors may direct questions to the CMRA help desk.


1 uses and safeguarding of information


Information from the secure web site is considered to be proprietary in nature when the contract number and contractor  identity  are  associated
with the direct labor hours and direct labor dollars.  At no time will any data be released to the public with the contractor name  and  contract
number associated with the data.

2 USER MANUALS


Data for Air Force service requirements must be input at the Air Force CMRA link.  However, user manuals for government personnel and
contractors are available at the Army CMRA link at http://www.ecmra.mil.




Appendix 1 – System Availability Thresholds



System availability is defined as the total time the system as a whole is available to users.  The “whole” system includes both system
availability and data availability.  Some systems have redundancy and users can be redirected to other nodes or enclaves in the event a node or
enclave goes down.  In this case, the amount of time required to transition users from the affected system to the redundant system will count
against the allowable downtime for the affected system each month.  Data availability covers three areas: replication and information services
(for systems utilizing these capabilities) and interfaces.  Replication is a measure of data latency.  Information services and interfaces are
measures of data availability which directly impact the whole system for the user.

Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)



Mission



The mission of this contract is to provice information technology (IT) support to enable the operational readiness of the systems, infrastructure, and services that satisfy the AMC and USTRANSCOM missions.  Services consist of operations and maintenance including help desk, system administration, network administration, database administration, web page support, and configuration management in support of the Air Mobility Command (AMC) and US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Command and Control (C2), In-Transit Visibility (ITV), and business systems (hereafter referred to as “Systems”).

Purpose



This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a government-developed document used to determine if the contractor’s performance meets the performance standards contained in the contract.  The QASP establishes procedures on how this surveillance/inspection process will be conducted to ensure successful PWS performance.  It provides a systematic method for a continuous oversight process to determine conformity with the technical requirements of the contract.  The QASP establishes:

 

What will be monitored.

How monitoring will take place.

Who will conduct monitoring.

How monitoring efforts and results will be documented.



The contractor is responsible for implementing and delivering performance that meets contract objectives using its Quality Control Plan (QCP).  The QASP provides the structure for the government’s surveillance of the contractor’s performance to assure that it meets contract requirements.  It is the government’s responsibility to be objective, fair and consistent in evaluating contractor performance. The Contracting Officer (CO) shall also ensure that the contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under this contract and determines the final assessment of contractor performance.



The QASP is not part of the contract nor is it intended to duplicate the contractor’s QCP.  This QASP is a living document.  Flexibility in the QASP is required to allow for an increase or decrease in the level of surveillance necessary based on contractor performance.



The government may provide a copy of the QASP to the contractor to facilitate open communication.  In addition, the QASP should recognize that unforeseen or uncontrollable circumstances might occur that are outside the control of the contractor.



The QASP should ensure early identification and resolution of performance issues to minimize impact on mission performance.

5.0 Contractor’s Quality Control Plan (QCP)



As required by the contract, the contractor’s commercial QCP included in the final proposal dated ___fill in after contract award__, is incorporated by reference.



Performance Requirements and Method(s) of Surveillance



6.1 Contract Surveillance



The goal of the QASP is to ensure that contractor performance is effectively monitored and documented.  The COR’s contribution is their professional, non-adversarial relationships with the CO and the contractor, which enables positive, open and timely communications.  The COR uses the methods contained in this QASP to ensure the contractor is in compliance with contract requirements.  The COR function is responsible for a wide range of surveillance requirements that effectively measure and evaluate the contractor’s performance.  Additionally, this QASP is based on the premise that the contractor, not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control/quality assurance actions to successfully meet the terms of the contract.

6.2 Surveillance Summary



The Services Summary (SS) and Method of Surveillance (Appendix 1) is the list of performance objectives and thresholds that must be performed by the contractor.  This summary details the method(s) of surveillance the COR will use to validate and inspect these performance objectives.  Inspection of each objective will be documented in the COR file.



Performance objectives define the desired outcomes.  Performance thresholds define the level of service required under the contract to successfully meet the performance objective. The Government performs surveillance, using this QASP, to determine the quality of the contractor’s performance as it relates to the performance thresholds.  The PWS and QASP should be used to form the foundation of the COR’s inspection. 



Method(s) of Surveillance:  



100% Inspection:  The COR will inspect and evaluate the contractor’s performance each time it is performed.  The result of the contractor’s overall performance is then evaluated to determine acceptability of the service provided.



Random Sampling:  When selecting samples, the number of selections should exceed the required sample size by at least 10 percent to allow for situations where a selected sample cannot be evaluated.  For example, if the sample size is 25 samples, select 28 samples.  The COR will make every attempt to evaluate the first 25 samples selected, but should surveillance of the 15th sample be impossible, then the COR must evaluate the 26th sample instead.  The COR must evaluate only 25 samples.



If the COR does not evaluate the total number of required samples, then the samples not evaluated are deemed to have been performed and are recorded as acceptable.



The Government inspector will submit a schedule to the contracting officer/contract administrator (CO/CA) the month prior to the month being inspected.  Schedule will show time, date, location, and item(s) that will be inspected.  Any changes to the schedule will be submitted to the CO/CA when the change occurs.



Periodic Inspection:  These items are inspected using periodic surveillance (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.) as determined by the COR.  The results of the periodic surveillance inspections may be used as the basis for actions (other than payment deductions) toward the contractor.  In such cases the Inspection of Services clause becomes the basis for the CO’s actions.  The schedules (if applicable) are submitted to the CA for review prior to the month being inspected.



Customer Complaint:  The COR is the point of contact and must collect all customer complaints.  The Customer Complaint Record below will be used for this purpose.  All complaints and any resulting resolution of such complaints must be documented with the information required on the customer complaint form.  Customer complaint forms become a permanent part of the COR file.



Surveillance Documentation 



7.1  Corrective Action Report (CAR) (Appendix 2)



Corrective Action reporting is divided into two categories, which are as follows:  minor and major.



Minor:  A minor discrepancy is a departure from established standards having little bearing on the service provided.  Some examples would be data deliverables with minor grammatical or spelling errors or insufficient copies of documents.  When the COR identifies a minor discrepancy, the COR shall document the discrepancy and verbally contact the designated contractor representatives, but is not required to notify the CO; however, if the same minor discrepancy is identified more than once, it may be an indication that a major discrepancy is occurring or has occurred because the contractor has not taken proper steps to prevent recurrence.  In this case, the COR shall notify the CO in writing, which may include e-mail.  

	

Major:  If at any time the COR identifies a condition as having a significant adverse effect on the quality of the service, such as those stated below, the COR shall document their findings and notify the CO immediately in writing.  E-mail is acceptable.  Major discrepancies will be reported by the COR to the designated contractor representative in writing; however, copies of written correspondence will be coordinated with the CO prior to issuance to the contactor representative.  Some examples would be contractor failure to meet a performance objective, failure to provide adequate corrective action to preclude recurrence of government-identified findings, failure to provide corrective action to deficiencies identified by the COR within a prescribed suspense period or failure to adhere to security regulations that results in a security incident. 



7.2 Customer Complaint Record (Appendix 3)



The COR shall ensure complaint procedures and forms are made available to all customers (See Customer Complaint Record below).  Any personnel that observe questionable or incomplete services or services not performed, or performed improperly, should immediately contact the COR.  The COR shall receive, document, and validate or invalidate all complaints.  If the complaint is invalid, the COR shall contact the complainant and explain why the complaint was invalid.  The COR shall fully document the resolution for each complaint on the Customer Complaint Record.  Complaints will be tracked and if the performance threshold is exceeded, the COR shall notify the CO in writing.  The CO will notify the contractor and appropriate action can be taken.



7.3 Performance Assessment Report (PAR) (Appendix 4)



PARs will be used to report all minor discrepancies and will be generated by the COR and sent to the contractor for corrective action.  Contractors will be given 10 days to correct PARs unless they have requested an extension.  If 3 minor discrepancies are found, combine them and process a CAR.

     

      7.4 Sample COR Services Summary Surveillance Report (Appendix 5)



The performance management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected outcomes.  Performance standards are expressed in the PWS and are assessed using the methods of surveillance shown in the SS surveillance.



8.0 Acceptance of Services



Before acceptance of product(s) or service(s) and/or approval of an invoice, the COR shall prepare a COR Services Summary Surveillance Report (Appendix 5) in accordance with the QASP and FAR 52.212-4 (Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items), Inspection and Acceptance Clause.  The report shall identify both positive and negative performance.  At a minimum, the report shall identify the number of assessments scheduled and conducted, the number of unacceptable/acceptable performances observed, the number of CARs issued, number of valid complaints, any significant contractor performance discrepancies, and a rating of the Contractor’s overall performance.  The report shall be signed and dated by the COR and uploaded to the CORT Tool.

 

The COR will certify that acceptable services were received, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.  The COR will certify receipt of contractor services via the Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) website.  Certification of services shall be accomplished no later than seven calendar days after receipt of the invoice.  To avoid payment of interest penalties, if the invoice is unacceptable, it should be rejected in WAWF within the first seven calendar days after receipt of the invoice, and the CO should be notified immediately.  



9.0 Contract Management



The MFT shall conduct periodic progress meetings to review the contractor’s performance.  At these meetings the CO will apprise the contractor of how the Government views the contractor’s performance and the contractor will apprise the Government of problems, if any, being experienced.  The contractor will immediately notify the CO and/or COR of any work being performed that the contractor considers over and above the requirements of the contract.  Appropriate action shall be taken to resolve any outstanding issues (i.e. CPARS, customer complaint reports, etc.). 



The MFT shall also provide any recommended changes to the QASP to the CO at the progress meetings or on an annual basis (at a minimum).

for the Release of Past Performance Information

to the Prime Contractor



Past performance information concerning subcontractors and teaming partners cannot be disclosed to a private party without the subcontractor’s or teaming partner’s consent. Because a prime contractor is a private party, the Government will need that consent before disclosing subcontractor/teaming partner past and present performance information to the prime contractor during exchanges. In an effort to assist the Government’s Past Performance evaluation team in assessing your recent past performance relevancy and confidence, we request that the following consent letter be completed by the major subcontractors/teaming partners identified in your proposal.  The completed consent letters should be submitted as part of your Past Performance Volume.

Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items



1.  SOURCE SELECTION



1.1. Basis for Contract Award 

This is a competitive best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS).  These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FARSite, http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of Technical/Technical Risk, Past Performance, and Price.  A contract may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation’s requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government.  The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Air Force the greatest confidence that it will best meet, or exceed, the requirements.  This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors, and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the technical approach and/or past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs the cost difference.  The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation (described below).  While the Government source selection evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.



1.2. Number of Contracts to be Awarded

The Government intends to award one contract for the Communications, Operations and Maintenance Functions II program.  However, the Government reserves the right to make no award at all.   



1.3. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers

The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.



1.4. Correction Potential of Proposals

The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency.  The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government.  If an aspect of an offeror's proposal does not meet the Government's requirements and is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.



1.5. Discussions

If during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror’s responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision.  



	(1) If the Government determines that, after the initial evaluation of proposals, discussions are necessary, the Government may make a competitive range determination (limited to a restricted number of the highest rated proposals) in order to establish a list of offerors with which it will conduct discussions.  



	(2) Discussions will be initiated by the CO issuing the ENs to the offerors within the competitive range.  ENs may be orally briefed to offerors prior to written release to ensure complete understanding by the respective offeror of any discrepancies.



	(3) Any offeror excluded at any time during the source selection process will be afforded the opportunity to request either a pre-award or post-award debriefing.     



2. EVALUATION FACTORS



2.1. Evaluation Factors and Subfactors 



a. The following evaluation factors and subfactors will be used to evaluate each proposal: Award will be made to the offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and subfactors described below.



Factor 1. Technical/Technical Risk 



	Subfactor 1. Technical Approach



	Subfactor 2. Staffing Approach



Factor 2. Past Performance



Factor 3. Price



	b. Relative Importance of Factors and Subfactors.  The relative importance of each factor and subfactor is as follows:  Technical/Technical Risk and Past Performance are of equal importance.  Within the Technical factor, the subfactors are considered of equal importance.    



In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than Price, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  



2.2. Technical Factor

The offeror’s technical solution will be evaluated by following DoD Source Selection Procedures Methodology 2, Separate Technical/Technical Risk Rating Process.  The Technical factor evaluation provides for two distinct but related assessments:  the Technical Rating and the Technical Risk Rating.  These two ratings have equal impact for the rating of each Technical subfactor.



Technical Rating. A color and an adjectival rating will be assigned to each subfactor IAW DoD Source Selection Procedures paragraph 3.1.2.2.1, Table 2 (shown below) to reflect the quality of the offeror’s technical solution for meeting the minimum performance or capability requirements through an assessment of the strengths and deficiencies of the proposal.  Subfactor ratings shall not be rolled up into an overall color rating for the Technical factor.  





2.2.1. Subfactor 1. Technical Approach

Offerors shall provide an effective and detailed plan describing their technical methodology/approach to be used in performing the requirements of the PWS.  Identify any best practices/innovations proposed.  Measures of merit for this subfactor are met when the offeror’s technical approach demonstrates the ability to:



a. Provide knowledge of AMC’s C2, ITV and business Systems listed in section 1.2 of the PWS.  Incorporate knowledge of the examples of software and appliances listed in section 1.1 of the PWS and the hardware and software listings in the bid library.



b. Provide Program Management.



c. Provide and maintain a Help Desk including responding to and tracking requests for technical assistance, diagnosing and resolving technical hardware and software issues, redirecting issues to appropriate resources, and maintaining, modernizing, and developing features for an automated trouble ticket tracking system.



d. Provide system administration services consisting of effective system/servers provisioning, installation, configuration, operation, and maintenance of Systems hardware, software, and related infrastructure.



e. Provide system monitoring including monitoring alarms; verifying the integrity and availability of all hardware, interfaces, server (including virtual server) resources, systems, and key processes; reviewing system and application logs; and verifying completion of scheduled jobs (e.g. clean-up scripts, backups, and resets).



f. Provide network administration services consisting of effective network/appliance provisioning, installation, configuration, security, operation, and maintenance of Systems hardware, software, and related infrastructure.



g. Perform network monitoring including monitoring alarms; verifying the integrity and availability of all hardware, appliances, resources, and systems.



h. Troubleshoot and resolve database system malfunctions to meet operational parameters and resolve issues by detecting and isolating faults, and taking corrective action to restore fully operational status.



i. Monitor assigned applications and related systems for the purpose of reducing application downtime and ensuring that assigned applications are available when needed to meet system performance and availability parameters.



j. Ensure configuration control is implemented for all items identified in the various Systems’ production configuration baselines and production virtual images.



k. Provide robust configuration management for the production environment for all assigned Systems.



2.2.2. Subfactor 2. Staffing Approach

Each offeror shall provide an effective and detailed plan describing their approach to overall staffing of and transition to COM-F II.  Measures of merit for this subfactor are met when the offeror’s staffing approach provides the following:



a. A staffing plan containing a personnel matrix that identifies the personnel resources to perform the requirements of the PWS.  The plan shall provide a logical approach that ensures timely support and shall specifically address the following requirements:



1. Process to recruit/retain/replace personnel who have the knowledge, experience, training, and technical expertise/certification/security clearances commensurate with the requirements of the PWS. 



2. Identification of key personnel listed in section 6.3 of the PWS to include position descriptions identifying the educational and experience level, requisite security clearances and (IA) certifications and any other qualifications showing the key individual’s ability to be key personnel for the services required by the PWS.  Additionally, the contractor shall include the specific resumes of the key personnel listed in section 6.3 of the PWS.  Salaries and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract should be included in accordance with FAR 52.222-46, incorporated by reference. 



3. A hierarchy chart displaying proposed organizational structure and span of authority.



4. Evidence of the ability to support PWS requirements during mission essential conditions for the tasks listed in section 13 of the PWS.



b. Phase-In Plan. Offerors shall provide a plan for transitioning services that includes specific details of the timelines needed to meet all Government requirements as detailed in sections 17.1 and 17.1.1 of the PWS.  In addition, the proposed plan must provide an explanation for start-up, mobilization, and transition depicting the chronological sequence of events which will be accomplished starting at contract award in order to meet all requirements of the PWS.   



In arriving at a best value decision, the Government reserves the right to give positive consideration, i.e., assign a strength, for performance in excess of objective requirements.  



Technical Risk Rating. Assessment of Technical Risk, which is manifested by the identification of weakness(es), considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs, or degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance.



A separate Technical Risk Rating will be assigned to each Technical subfactor IAW DoD Source Selection Procedures paragraph 3.1.2.2.2, Table 3 (shown below).  The risk rating considers the risk associated with the technical approach in meeting the requirement.  For any weaknesses identified, the evaluation shall address the offeror’s proposed mitigation and why that mitigation approach is or is not manageable. 





2.3. Past Performance Factor

The Past Performance evaluation results in an assessment of the offeror’s probability of meeting the solicitation requirements.  

 

	a. Ratings. One performance confidence assessment rating will be assigned for each offeror after evaluating the offeror’s recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements.  The performance confidence assessments ratings are described in DoD Source Selection Procedures, Table 5 – Performance Confidence Assessments, excerpted below:  













	b. Evaluation Process. The Government will require offerors to submit Past Performance Information Sheets (PPIS) with individual contract references for the past performance evaluation.  Performance confidence is assessed at the overall Past Performance factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror’s recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the Technical subfactors and Price factor taking into consideration their relative order of importance.  The Government may consider past performance in the aggregate in addition to on an individual contract basis.  In conducting the Past Performance evaluation, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided in the offeror’s Past Performance proposal volume and information obtained from other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), and other databases; interviews with Program Managers, COs; Past Performance Questionnaires; and commercial sources.



(1) Recency Assessment. An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past 3 years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.



(2) Relevancy Assessment.  The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of all recent performance information focusing on performance that is relevant to the Technical subfactors and Price factor taking into consideration their relative order of importance.  Consideration will be given to the scope and complexity of the reference and the contractor’s ability to provide operations and maintenance support expertise.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s past performance will be made for each reference based upon the aforementioned considerations, including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s).  Each offeror’s total past performance will be evaluated in the aggregate with prime offeror’s past performance being of equal weight to team member’s past performance.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  The PPIS and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the degree of relevancy of past performance.  The Government will use the following relevancy definitions when assessing recent contracts:







	



c. Assigning Ratings. As a result of the relevancy assessments of the recent contracts evaluated and how well the contractor performed on contracts reviewed through CPARS, PPIRS, FAPIIS, etc. and contracts listed in PPIS’s, offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating.  Although the past performance evaluation focuses on performance that is relevant to the Technical subfactors and Price factor, the resulting performance confidence assessment rating is made at the factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor past performance.  Offerors without a record of recent/relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating for the Past Performance factor.  



More recent and higher rated relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than less recent or lower rated relevant performance.  A strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating.  Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance.



2.4. Price Factor



a. Each offeror’s price proposal will be evaluated (but not rated) for award purposes.  The total evaluated price (TEP) will be calculated as the sum of the offeror’s proposed prices for the basic requirements (3-month phase-in/1-month base period), all option periods (four 1-year options and one 8-month option) and the 6-month option to extend services.  Evaluation of options and/or extensions shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options or extensions.  TEP will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is fair and reasonable.  Normally, price reasonableness is established through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.  The Government anticipates using the price analysis techniques defined in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(i), (ii), and (v) to determine prices fair and reasonable.  In the event these techniques are insufficient to establish a fair and reasonable price determination, other proposal analysis techniques may be used.



b. The 6-month option to extend services is IAW FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services" and will only be utilized if necessary.  The 6-month option to extend services is not to be considered part of option period 5 and will be a separate option exercised if it is utilized.  However, proposed pricing for the 6-month extension will be based on option period 5 pricing.



c. Also included in the TEP calculation shall be any ODCs and Travel CLINs provided by the Government.  The TEP supports a contract total price based on the basic requirements (3-month phase-in/1-month base period), all options periods (four 1-year options and one 8-month option) and the 6-month option to extend services following option period 5.



d. The offerors’ proposals will be evaluated to determine completeness and reasonableness, as defined below.



(1) Completeness.  The proposals will be reviewed to determine the extent to which all the price elements of the offer have been addressed.  The offeror’s price proposal will be evaluated to ensure continuity and traceability of prices to the technical proposal and between the initial proposal and any revisions thereto.  The review will determine the adequacy of the contractor’s proposal in addressing and fulfilling the solicitation requirements. 



(2) Reasonableness.  For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay in the conduct of competitive business.  As stated above, price reasonableness is established through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.



3. Solicitation Requirements, Terms and Conditions

Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as factors or subfactors.  Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the offeror being ineligible for award.  Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and must provide complete supporting rationale.

The Technical Volume should be specific and complete.  Legibility, clarity, and coherence are very important.  Your responses will be evaluated against the Technical subfactors defined in Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items.  Using the instructions provided below, provide as specifically as possible the actual methodology you would use for accomplishing/satisfying these subfactors.  All the requirements specified in the solicitation are mandatory.  By your proposal submission, you are representing that your firm will perform all the requirements specified in the solicitation.  It is not necessary or desirable for you to tell us so in your proposal.  Do not merely reiterate the objectives or reformulate the requirements specified in the solicitation. 



3.2 Format and Specific Content



3.2.1 Technical  

In the Technical volume, address your technical solution for meeting or exceeding the Government’s minimum performance or capability requirements of each Technical subfactor. 



3.2.1.1 Technical Risk

Address Technical Risk associated with those aspects of your proposed technical approach you consider to have the potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs, degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance by submitting a Risk Matrix.  Classify each risk in accordance with DoD Source Selection Procedures Table 3, Technical Risk Rating (listed in Addendum to FAR 52.212-2).  Provide the rationale for each risk and its rating, including quantitative estimates of the impact on cost, schedule, and performance.  Describe the impact of each identified risk in terms of its potential to interfere with or prevent the successful accomplishment of other contract requirements (for example:  PWS), whether or not those requirements are identified as subfactors.  Propose a realistic "workaround" or risk mitigators for identified risks that will eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level.  Identify and classify any new risks introduced by such risk mitigation. 



3.2.2 Volume Organization

The Technical volume shall be organized according to the following general outline:

3.2.4 Subfactor One – Technical Approach

Each offeror shall provide an effective and detailed plan describing their technical methodology/approach to be used in performing the requirements of the PWS.  The specific requirements of the Technical Approach subfactor are defined in Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items.        



3.2.5 Subfactor Two – Staffing Approach

Each offeror shall provide an effective and detailed plan with their approach to overall staffing of and transition to COM-F II.  The specific requirements of the Staffing Approach subfactor are defined in Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items.    



4.0 Volume III - Past Performance 



4.1 General

Each offeror shall submit a Past Performance volume with its proposal, containing past performance information in accordance with the format contained in the PPIS (RFP Attachment 4).  This information is required on the offeror and all subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners who are proposed to perform aspects of the effort the offeror considers critical to overall successful performance.  Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each offeror in this volume and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past performance. 



Along with the information required in this paragraph, the offeror shall submit a consent letter (RFP Attachment 5) executed by each subcontractor, teaming partner, and/or joint venture partner, authorizing release of adverse past performance information to the offeror so the offeror can respond to such information.  For each identified effort for a commercial customer, the offeror shall also submit a client authorization letter (see sample at RFP Attachment 6), authorizing release to the Government of requested information on the offeror's performance.



4.2 Early Proposal Information 

Each offeror is requested to submit the information shown in the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (RFP Attachment 8) for each relevant contract 10 calendar days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals.  Failure to submit early proposal information will not result in offeror disqualification.  



As soon as practicable, offerors shall e-mail the PPQ (RFP Attachment 8) with section 1 completed and the Past Performance Questionnaire Cover Letter (RFP Attachment 7) to the points of contact (POCs) the offeror has listed in the PPIS (RFP Attachment 4).  The POCs listed in the PPIS’s should represent the individuals most knowledgeable about the offeror’s performance on the identified contract or program, such as the following:  (1) Contracting Officer’s Representative; (2) Program/Project Manager; (3) Contracting Officer.  The POCs will complete the questionnaires and forward them by email directly to the CS, Lee Mutschler at  and to Jennifer Gasparich at .  RESPONDENTS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRES SHALL NOT SEND THE COMPLETED INFORMATION SHEETS BACK TO THE OFFEROR.  Offerors are encouraged to follow-up with respondents to ensure they have completed the questionnaires.  In order to facilitate receiving the PPQs that are not received early, offerors shall submit the name, phone number, and email address for the POCs receiving PPQs to the CS 10 calendar days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals.  The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will also conduct follow-up with any POC as necessary.  Again, PPQs should be submitted to the CS 10 calendar days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals.  The CO will use discretion in accepting PPQs received after the requested date.       





4.3 Relevant/Recent Contracts (Limitd to six contracts, no more than 10 pages per contract reference)

Submit information in accordance with the PPIS (RFP Attachment 4).  The PPIS shall consist of no more than six contracts that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your team’s ability to perform the proposed effort.  A contract is considered recent if it is an ongoing contract or if it was completed within three years of the date of issuance of the solicitation.  As stated above, no more than six contracts total shall be submitted for each offeror/team.  Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance.  For a description of the characteristics or aspects the Government will consider in determining recency and relevancy, see Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Section 2.3 – Past Performance Factor.  The Government may consider past performance in the aggregate in addition to on an individual contract basis.  Contractors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or is so sparse that a confidence assessment cannot be reasonably assigned will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and as a result, will receive an “Unknown Confidence” rating for the Past Performance factor.  Any past performance information submitted over the maximum of six total contracts (including prime and subcontractors) will be disregarded in its entirety.  If submitting an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for consideration, the task order for which evaluation is requested shall be specified.  Each task order submitted will count toward the six contract maximum limitation.

 

4.3.1 Specific Content 

Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate.  This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.  Merely having problems does not automatically equate to a limited or no confidence rating, since the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to overcome the problems encountered.  The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified.  This may allow the offeror to be considered a higher confidence candidate.  For example, submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that clearly support that an offeror has overcome past problems is required.  Categorize the relevant information into the specific Technical subfactors and Price factor used to evaluate the proposal.



4.3.2 Organizational Structure Change History 

Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc.  In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition.  To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of your company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice.  As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment.  Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offeror(s), your "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources.

for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of

exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.



(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:



(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.



(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.



(ii) Examples.



(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this

I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.



(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.



(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).





(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
