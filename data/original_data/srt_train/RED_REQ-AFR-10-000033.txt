SECTION B – CONTINUATION OF SF-1449


B.1   TITLE


Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Equipment for the Research and Education Network of Uganda.


B.2   ORDER TYPE

USAID anticipates awarding a Firm- Fixed Price Contract for delivery of this equipment.



B.3   AUTHORIZED GEOGRAPHIC CODE


The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this contract is 000 – United States.



B.4       STATEMENT OF WORK


The purpose of this acquisition is to procure, deliver, install, and maintain two sets of ICT equipment:  (1) switches & routers and (2) Optical
transmission, multiplexing, and interface equipment to work in conjunction with the Research and Education Network of Uganda (RENU).   The
equipment will encompass roughly 25% part of a larger network provisioned by the private sector partner under a USAID public-private alliance. 

The chair of the Research and Education Network of Uganda (RENU) of the Uganda Christian University (UCU),  will facilitate tax free customs
clearance for the equipment.  UCU is a bona fide institution of tertiary education that will fulfill the requirements for entry of the equipment
free of duty and other fees associated with customs clearance. Given the location of UCU, instructions call for the equipment to be transported
to the address noted in the shipping directions below.  While UCU is responsible for customs clearance duties and fees, it is the responsibility
of the vendor to incorporate any and all other costs into their fixed price quote.

This RFQ requests two sets of equipment:  (1) switches & routings equipment and (2) optical.   Respondents may respond to either both sets of
equipment or one set only.

                           Equipment Set #1:  Juniper Switches and Routers for Research and Education Network of Uganda

Note:  The equipment to be procured by USAID forms roughly 25% part of a larger network, including identical switching and routing equipment
provided by Juniper, as well as spares and installation and maintenance services from Juniper.  Compatibility with Juniper equipment is
essential to the operation of the network and to fulfilling these specific requirements.  Juniper part numbers are specified as well as specific
requirements addressed by each piece of equipment.  A key factor for reliability and up-time of the network to be constructed is availability of
local support and the commitment of the supplier to provide local parts spare depot and localized technical support.

         Equipment Set #2:  ADVA Optical transmission, multiplexing, and interface equipment for Research and Education Network of Uganda

Note:  The equipment to be procured by USAID forms roughly 25% part of a larger network, including identical or similar optical interface and
multiplexing equipment provided by ADVA, as well as spares and installation and maintenance services from ADVA.  Compatibility with ADVA
equipment, including optical interfaces on the optronic multiplexing equipment as well as optical interfaces to the switches and routers of the
network, is therefore essential to the operation of the network and to fulfilling the mission of the Research and Education Network of Uganda.
