(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

Require each Investigator to complete training regarding the Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy prior to engaging in research related to any NIH-funded contract and at least every four years. The Institution must take reasonable steps [see Part 94.4(c)] to ensure that investigators working as collaborators, consultants or subcontractors comply with the regulations. c. Designate an official(s) to solicit and review disclosures of significant financial interests from each Investigator who is planning to participate in, or is participating in, the NIH-funded research.

d. Require that each Investigator who is planning to participate in the NIH-funded research disclose to the Institution's designated official(s) the Investigator's significant financial interest (and those of the Investigator's spouse and dependent children) no later than the date of submission of the Institution's proposal for NIHfunded research. Require that each Investigator who is participating in the NIH-funded research to submit an updated disclosure of significant financial interests at least annually, in accordance with the specific time period prescribed by the Institution during the period of the award as well as within thirty days of discovering or acquiring a new significant financial interest. e. Provide guidelines consistent with the regulations for the designated official(s) to determine whether an Investigator's significant financial interest is related to NIH-funded research and, if so related, whether the significant financial interest is a financial conflict of interest. An Investigator's significant financial interest is related to NIH-funded research when the Institution, thorough its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest: Could be affected by the NIH-funded research; or is in an entity whose financial interest could be affected by the research. A financial conflict of interest exists when the Institution, through its designated official(s), reasonably determines that the significant financial interest could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the NIH-funded research. f. Take such actions as necessary to manage financial conflicts of interest, including any financial conflicts of a subcontractor Investigator. Management of an identified financial conflict of interest requires development and implementation of a management plan and, if necessary, a retrospective review and mitigation report pursuant to Part 94.5(a).

Complete the certification in Section K - Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors titled "Certification of Institutional Policy on Financial Conflicts of Interest".

j.

If the failure of an Institution to comply with an Institution's financial conflicts of interest policy or a financial conflict of interest management plan appears to have biased the design, conduct, or reporting of the NIH-funded research, the Institution must promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the corrective action taken or to be taken. The Contracting Officer will consider the situation and, as necessary, take appropriate action or refer the matter to the Institution for further action, which may include directions to the Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity in the NIH-funded research project. The Contracting Officer and/or HHS may inquire at any time before, during, or after award into any Investigator disclosure of financial interests, and the Institution's review of, and response to, such disclosure, regardless of whether the disclosure resulted in the Institution's determination of a financial conflict of interests.. The Contracting Officer may require submission of the records or review them on site. On the basis of this review of records or other information that may be available, the Contracting Officer may decide that a particular financial conflict of interest will bias the objectivity of the NIH-funded research to such an extent that further corrective 25 Revised 2/15/2012

"Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), data contained in the portions of this proposal which the Offeror has specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes. The Offeror acknowledges that HHS may not be able to withhold a record (e.g. data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the HHS's FOI officials must make that determination. The Offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if HHS has determined that disclosure is required by the Act. If a contract is awarded to the Offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act.

"Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation." (3) Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive statements or statements differing in substance from those cited above may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with a nonconforming statement(s). (f) Contract award . (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.

Revised 2/15/2012

Solicitation Number NIHCL20120109 Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) to the SSA Disability Evaluation Process (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offerors initial proposal should contain the Offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the Offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with Offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting Offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:

(i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed Offerors offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and debriefed Offeror and past performance information on the debriefed Offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all Offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection; (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful Offeror. (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed Offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. (End of Provision) Alternate I ( October 1997).As prescribed in 15.209(a)(1), substitute the following paragraph (f)(4) for paragraph (f)(4) of the basic provision: 37 Revised 2/15/2012

Solicitation Number NIHCL20120109 Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) to the SSA Disability Evaluation Process (f) (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with Offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the Offerors initial proposal should contain the Offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. b. NAICS CODE AND SIZE STANDARD Note: The following information is to be used by the Offeror in preparing its Representations and Certifications (See Section K of this RFP), specifically in completing the provision entitled, SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REPRESENTATION, FAR Clause 52.219-1. 1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 . 2. The small business size standard is $18.0 Million . THIS REQUIREMENT IS NOT SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS. However, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires in every solicitation, (except for foreign acquisitions) the inclusion of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code and corresponding size standard which best describes the nature of the requirement in the solicitation. c. TYPE OF CONTRACT AND NUMBER OF AWARDS It is anticipated that one award will be made from this solicitation and that the award(s) will be made on/about June 1, 2011. It is anticipated that the award(s) from this solicitation will be a multiple-year Fixed-Price contract with Period of Performance of 36 months d. COMMITMENT OF PUBLIC FUNDS The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with the proposed procurement. Any other commitment, either explicit or implied, is invalid. e. COMMUNICATIONS PRIOR TO CONTRACT AWARD Offerors shall direct all communications to the attention of the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer cited on the face page of this RFP. Communications with other officials may compromise the competitiveness of this acquisition and result in cancellation of the requirement.

10. Selection of Offerors a. The acceptability of the scientific and technical portion of each research contract proposal will be evaluated by a technical review committee. The committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity with the evaluation factors of the RFP, utilizing point scores and written critiques. The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an Offeror. b. The business portion of each contract proposal will be subjected to a cost and price analysis, management analysis, etc. c. If award will be made without conducting discussions, Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g., the relevance of an Offerors past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the Offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors. d. If the Government intends to conduct discussions prior to awarding a contract 1. Communications will be held with Offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from being placed within the competitive range. Such communications shall address adverse past performance information to which an Offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond. Also, communications may be held with any other Offerors whose exclusion from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain. Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal deficiencies or omissions that alter the technical or cost elements of the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal, but may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of establishing the competitive range. The Contracting Officer will, in concert with program staff, decide which proposals are in the competitive range. The competitive range will be comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals. Oral or written discussions will be conducted with all Offerors in the competitive range.

b. Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotations/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 visions is available at http://www.section508.gov/ . The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm . c. The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, Offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability Web site ( http://www.hhs.gov/od/ ). d. Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government -- i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense.

If the evaluation factor in this solicitation includes an SDB evaluation factor or subfactor that considers the extent to which SDB concerns are specifically identified, the SDB concerns considered in the evaluation shall be listed in any resultant contract. Offerors should note that addressing the extent of small disadvantaged business participation is not in any way intended to be a substitute for submission of the subcontracting plan, if it is required by this solicitation. An example of the type of information that might be given (in addition to the narrative describing the plan for meeting the targets) follows: EXAMPLE Targets for SDB Participation - NAICS Industry Subsector 223 SDB Percentage of Total Contract Value 25% 10% SDB Dollars $250,000 $100,000

Total Contract Value- $1,000,000 SDB Participation by Prime (Includes joint venture partners and team arrangements)* SDB Participation by subcontractors

15%

$150,000

*Note: FAR Subpart 9.6 defines "Contractor team arrangements" to include two or more companies forming a partnership or joint venture to act as a potential Prime Contractor, or a potential Prime Contractor who agrees with one or more companies to have them act as its subcontractors on a specific contract or acquisition program. For purposes of evaluation of the SDB participation factor, FAR 19.12024 requires that SDB joint ventures and teaming arrangements at the prime level be presented separately from SDB participation by subcontractors.

Solicitation Number NIHCL20120109 Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) to the SSA Disability Evaluation Process 7. Total Compensation Plan a. Instructions 1. Total compensation (salary and fringe benefits) of professional employees under service contracts may, in some cases, be lowered by recompetition of these contracts. Lowering of compensation can be detrimental in obtaining the necessary quality of professional services needed for adequate performance of service contracts. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR Part 541, be properly compensated in these contracts. All Offerors as a part of their Business Proposal will submit a "Total Compensation Plan" (salaries and fringe benefits) for these professional employees for evaluation purposes. 2. The Government will evaluate the Total Compensation Plan to ensure that this compensation reflects a sound management approach and an understanding of the requirements to be performed. It will include an assessment of the Offerors ability to provide uninterrupted work of high quality. The total compensation proposed will be evaluated in terms of enhancing recruitment and retention of personnel and its realism and consistency with a total plan for compensation (both salaries and fringe benefits). 3. Evaluation for award, therefore, will include an assessment of the Total Compensation Plan submitted by each Offeror. Evaluation 4. Total Compensation Plan (Professional Employees) In establishing compensation levels for professional employees, the total compensation (both salaries and fringe benefits) proposed shall reflect a clear understanding of the requirements of the work to be accomplished and the suitability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and retain qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must recognize the distinct differences in professional skills and the complexity of varied disciplines as well as job difficulty. Proposals offering total compensation levels less than currently being paid by the predecessor Contractor for the same work will be evaluated, in addition to the above, on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted work of high quality, and availability of required competent professional employees. Offerors are cautioned that instances of lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may be considered a lack of sound management judgment in addition to indicating a lack of understanding of the requirement. Cost (Professional Compensation) Proposals which are unrealistically low or do not reflect a reasonable relationship of compensation to the professional job categories so as to impair the Contractor's ability to recruit and retain competent professional employees, may be viewed as reflecting a failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements. The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. The compensation data required will be used in evaluation of the Offerors understanding of the contract requirements. Other (Labor Relations) An assessment of the potential for adverse effect upon performance and maintenance of the required number of professional employees with requisite skills resulting from an unrealistically low compensation structure will also be made. Federal Acquisition Regulation Clauses incorporated by Reference FAR Clause 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees (FEBRUARY 1993).

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
1. GENERAL The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include technical (which encompasses experience and past performance factors), cost/price factors and Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Participation. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost/price and SDB participation is also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are [significantly more important than cost/price/approximately equal to cost/price/significantly less important than cost or price] . The Government intends to make an award(s) to that Offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFP. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFP. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors listed below. 2. COST/PRICE EVALUATION Offeror(s) cost/price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. HUMAN SUBJECT EVALUATION This research project involves human subjects. NIH Policy requires: a. Protection of Human Subjects from Research Risks The Offerors proposal must address the involvement of human subjects and protections from research risk relating to their participation, or provide sufficient information on the research subjects to allow a determination by the principal investigator that a designated exemption is appropriate. If you claim that this research should be considered exempt from coverage by the Federal Regulations at 45 CFR 46, the proposal should address why you believe it is exempt, and under which exemption it applies. The reviewers will evaluate the proposal with regard to four issues: Risks to Human Subjects, Adequacy of Protection Against Risks, Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others, and Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained. See Section L for a complete discussion of what is required to be addressed for each of these issues. Based on the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., concerns are identified as to the protections described against risk to human subjects or no discussion is found regarding protections against risk to human subjects) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the protection of human subjects from research risks is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award.

Solicitation Number NIHCL20120109 Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) to the SSA Disability Evaluation Process b. Women and Minorities Women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations must be included in the study population of research involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification are provided indicating that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. In addition, for NIH-Defined Phase III clinical trials, all proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to detect significant differences in intervention effect (see NIH Guide http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm , Definitions Significant Difference) by sex/gender, racial/ethnic groups, and relevant subpopulations, if applicable, unless the Government has specified that this solicitation involves a sex/gender specific study or a single or limited number of minority population groups. The proposal also must include one of the following plans:  Plans to conduct valid analysis to detect significant differences in intervention effect among sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support these significant differences among subgroups, OR  Plans to include and analyze sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support no significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups (representation of sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic groups as subject selection criterion is not required; however, inclusion and analyses are encouraged), OR  Plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups (without requiring high statistical power for each subgroup) when the prior studies neither support nor negate significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups.

Also, the proposal must address the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women and minorities as participants. Reviewers will consider the areas covered here and in Section L of the solicitation in narrative form in their evaluation. Some of the issues they will evaluate include:   whether the plan proposed includes minorities and both genders in adequate representation how the Offeror addresses the inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations in the development of a proposal that is appropriate to the scientific objectives of the solicitation the description of the proposed study populations in terms of sex/gender and racial/ethnic groups and the rationale for selection of such subjects if exclusion is proposed, that the rationale is appropriate with respect to the health of the subjects and/or to the purpose of the research. In addition, for gender exclusion, the reviewers will examine the rationale to determine if it is because: ˇ the purpose of the research constrains the Offerors selection of study participants by gender (e.g., uniquely valuable stored specimens or existing datasets are single gender; very small numbers of subjects are involved; or ˇ overriding factors dictate selection of subjects); or ˇ gender representation of specimens or existing datasets cannot be accurately determined, and this does not compromise the scientific objectives of the research. For minority group exclusion, the reviewers will examine the rationale to determine if those minority groups are excluded because: ˇ inclusion of those groups would be inappropriate with respect to their health; or ˇ inclusion of those groups would be inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research. Revised 2/15/2012 54

  



Solicitation Number NIHCL20120109 Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) to the SSA Disability Evaluation Process



For NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials, reviewers will also consider whether there is an adequate description of plans to conduct analyses to detect significant differences of clinical or public health importance in intervention effect(s) by sex/gender and/or racial ethnic subgroups when the intervention effect(s) is expected in the primary analyses, or if there is an adequate description of plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in subgroups when the intervention effect(s) is not expected in the primary analyses.

If you determine that inclusion of women and minority populations is not feasible, you must submit a detailed rationale and justification for exclusion of one or both groups from the study population with the technical proposal. The Government will review the rationale to determine if it is appropriate with respect to the health of the subjects and/or the purpose of the research Based on the evaluation of the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., no discussion can be found regarding the proposed gender/minority inclusion plans, or concerns are identified as to the gender or minority representation, or the proposal does not adequately address limited representation of one gender or minority; or the plan is not in accordance with NIH policy guidelines) or "acceptable." See Section L of the solicitation for the requirements of women/minorities inclusion. If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the inclusion/exclusion of women and minorities is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. c. Children Children (i.e. individuals under the age of 21) must be included in all human subject research unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to include them. Your proposal must include a description of plans for including children. If you plan to exclude children from the required research, your proposal must present an acceptable justification for the exclusion. If you determine that exclusion of a specific age range of child is appropriate, your proposal must also address the rationale for such exclusion. Also, the plan must include a description of the expertise of the investigative team for dealing with children at the ages included, of the appropriateness of the available facilities to accommodate the children, and the inclusion of a sufficient number of children to contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose/objective of the solicitation. Also, see Section L of the solicitation for further specific requirements on inclusion of children. Based on the reviewers' evaluation of the Offerors response, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., no discussion can be found regarding the proposed inclusion plans for children; or concerns are identified as to the Offerors response regarding the inclusion of children; or the plan is not in accordance wit h NIH policy guidelines) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS The following evaluation factors are used by the technical evaluation committee when reviewing and scoring the technical proposals. Technical proposal: For the purposes of the award, the Technical Evaluation Panel will select the best overall proposal based primarily on technical merit with cost and other factors considered as appropriate. In determining the best overall proposal, the following criteria will be scored with the corresponding maximum point values for each area, yielding a total of 100 obtainable points. Experience, past performance, and technical knowledge: 55 points

The Offeror will provide evidence of the qualifications and experience of key proposed personnel (including staff, consultants, and contractors) through resumes (or CV). A description of past work experience; and, service on expert panels or committees in areas requiring skills relevant to the proposed work is expected. Personnel will be evaluated collectively on the breadth and depth of their experience performing work similar to that outlined in this RFP with emphasis placed on experience within the past 5 years. The contractor should provide evidence of sufficient personnel and detail strategies to support the scope of work detailed in the Statement of Work (SOW). A detailed description of past CAT tool development and the populations with whom the CAT instrument has been tested is necessary. Knowledge and experience in the development and testing of CAT tools specifically for application within a disability framework will be evaluated. 56 Revised 2/15/2012

Solicitation Number NIHCL20120109 Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) to the SSA Disability Evaluation Process Relevant publications should be provided as supportive evidence. Evidence of the ability to modify the CAT instrument to meet unique population needs must be provided. The contractor must demonstrate expertise in the application and evaluation of CAT tools across a range of patient conditions. The contractor should demonstrate successful CAT tool development relative to project completion within established periods of performance and budget. A description of completed calibration studies, including demographic and geographic descriptors of the sample, sample size and recruitment methods will be required. Identification of experienced consultants and sub-contractors for support of the project will also be evaluated.

Understanding of requirement and completeness:

15 points

The Offeror will demonstrate a thorough understanding of the Government's requirement through detailed description of the proposed approach, suggesting solutions to potential problems that could arise during CAT tool development, calibration study implementation, CAT tool validation; and, the scheduling and assignment of tasks.

Quality of technical proposal

15 points

The Offeror will submit a technical proposal that is clear, concise, and comprehensive. The Offeror should provide evidence demonstrating the capacity to complete the work specified in the requirements within the period of performance and provide a timeline for these activities. The Offeror must address each requirement specified in the statement of work. A plan for quality assurance should be included as part of the overall proposal.

Availability of equipment essential to the requirement:

15 points

The Offeror shall describe the facilities, equipment, and other infrastructure components available to perform this work in addition to describing how these resources will be used to meet the Government's requirements. 7. EVALUATION OF ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY - SECTION 508 The Offerors proposal must demonstrate compliance with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194 for all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used under this contract/order, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports. If your proposal does not include a completed HHS "Section 508 Product Assessment Template" (hereafter referred to as the "Template") which demonstrates that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, or, if the completed "Template" included in your proposal is considered "noncompliant," and the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to further discuss, clarify or modify the "Template" during discussions and in your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). If your "Template" is still considered "noncompliant" by the Government after discussions, your proposal may not be considered further for award. 8. Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against the three evaluation factors outlined above. The factors in order of importance are: Technical, Understanding of Requirement and Completeness, Quality of Technical proposal and Availability of Equipment essential to the Requirement with technical being paramount. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.

Revised 2/15/2012

Solicitation Number NIHCL20120109 Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) to the SSA Disability Evaluation Process Offerors are advised that award will be made to that Offeror whose proposal provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall cost to the Government may become a significant determining factor for award of a contract as proposals become more equal based on the other factors. In any event the Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government, cost and other factors considered. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set for the in the RFP. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFP.
