|______________         |_________________           |

                                                               [List as necessary]
      (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO
        GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy
        American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting
        Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the
        requirements of the solicitation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
   simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
   principals—
   (1) [   ] Are, [   ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
      Federal agency;
   (2) [   ] Have, [   ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against
      them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or
      local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or
      commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion,
      violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
   (3) [   ] Are, [   ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any
      of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
   (4) [   ] Have, [   ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount
      that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
           determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the
           liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
           payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
           of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
           Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
           under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to
           further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is
           entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is
           not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax
           liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
           full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full
           payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
           11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in

        forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the
        basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.

(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For

      (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as
        that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
   [   ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that—
      (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or
        subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business
        operations;
      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
        4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used
        for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
   (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
        Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or
        (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this
   information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
   (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection
      requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations

ED 307-17 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (AUG 2007)
a)    The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, has certified that, to the  best  of  their  knowledge  and  belief,  there  are  no
   relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or  personal  conflict  of  interest,  (see  FAR  Subpart  9.5  for
   organizational conflicts of interest), (or apparent conflict of interest) for the organization or any of its staff, and that  the  contractor,
   subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a  conflict  of  interest  appears  to  exist  to  a
   reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor,  subcontractor,
   employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations:
   1) Unequal access to information – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information  through
      its performance on a government contract.
   2) Biased ground rules – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program,  on
      the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract,
   3) Impaired objectivity – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family  (spouse,  parent
      or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation  of
      government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance  or  other  services  to
      recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility.


      "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge  of  the
      relevant facts to question a person's objectivity:
      i)    Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services  that  may
        be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered  by
        the Department;
      ii)   Significant connections to teaching methodologies that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services;
        or
      iii)  Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might  require  or  encourage  the  use  of  a  specific
        curriculum, specific products, property or services.


      Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict  of  interest)  of  interest
      regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or  potential  conflict  (or  apparent  conflict  of  interest)  would  not  impair  their
      objectivity.


      In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department  will  take  appropriate
      actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict  (or  apparent  conflict  of  interest),  including  but  not  limited  to
      mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such  means  as  ensuring  a  balance  of  views,  disclosure  with  the
      appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the  term
      “potential conflict” means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest.


b)    The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if “impaired objectivity, or an actual or potential conflict of  interest
   (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make  a  full  disclosure  in  writing  to  the  Contracting
   Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the
   CO, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest).
c)    Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if  it  deems  such  termination  necessary  to
   avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award  or  discovered
   an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information  to
   the CO, the Government may terminate the contract for default/cause, or pursue such other  remedies  as  may  be  permitted  by  law  or  this
   contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, § 1001 and fines of up to  $5000  for
   violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, § 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal  government.  The
   Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related  to  conflicts  of
   interest. For example, such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest.


d)    In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees  to  eliminate
   the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the CO.
e)    The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform  substantially
   to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e).

                                                        Conflict of Interest Certification


   The Offeror, _______________________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of their knowledge  and  belief,  there  are  no  present  or
   currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract  or
   task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. ____________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of  interest  (or  apparent
   conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would  impinge  on  its
   ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or  advice  or  result  in  it  being  given  an  unfair  competitive
   advantage. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The Offeror further certifies that
   it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such  Conflict
   of Interest (or apparent conflict of interest).

  (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:
       (1) The schedule of supplies/services (Sections B1, B2 and D).

   contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance
   on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to
   review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure
   it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a
   substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
       (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
   contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
   and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
   day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and
   (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the
   notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
        (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
   paragraph (t)(2)(i)(c) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information
   that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the
   meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
       (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect
   an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the
   CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate
   recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment”
   paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
       (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
   http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

10 C.8. CONTRACTING OFFICER’S REPRESENTATIVE.

a. The CO may have several representatives to assist with monitoring and administering the IDIQ contracts and the individual TOs.  The
   Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract or the specific TO, acting as
   the technical liaison with the Contractor, and performing any other responsibilities that are specified in the contract or TO.  The
   Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) is responsible for the administrative aspects of the contract.
b. At the discretion of the CO, the COTR identified in a TO may also assume the administrative duties and responsibilities of a COR.  In those
   cases, the task order will have a COTR performing technical and administrative duties and no COR is assigned to the task order.
c. The COTR duties include but are not limited to the following:
   1. Monitor and assure that the Contractor performs the technical requirements of the contract;
   2. Communicate technical direction to the Contractor;
   3. Review, evaluate, and comment on any aspect of the contract and its performance, to include problem areas, proposals, and technical issues,
      and make written recommendations to the CO;
   4. Preparing technical evaluations to support determinations that requested changes are not outside the scope of the contract;
   5. Assist the CO in analyzing a claim, recommend settlement position, and participate in the resolution process.
d. The COR Administrative duties include but are not limited to the following:
   1. Prepare a COR work plan, and establish and maintain appropriate record-keeping files;
   2. Coordinate site entry for Contractor/government personnel, as appropriate;
   3. Prepare monthly performance;
   4. Advise the CO on completion of the contract regarding receipt of all items, services, and reports required under the contract, and in
      compliance with all contract provisions;
   5. Provide advice and assistance to the CO in those areas of contract administration that are not specifically covered in this designation.
e. The COTR/COR are not authorized to make any commitments, otherwise obligate the Government, or to authorize any changes which affect the
   contract price, terms or conditions.  The COTR/COR do not have authority to act as agents of the Government under this contract.  Any
   Contractor requests for changes shall be submitted in writing directly to the Contracting Officer with a copy to the COTR/COR.  No such
   changes shall be made without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.   Only the Contracting Officer has authority to direct or
   negotiate any changes in the statement of work; modify or extend the period of performance, change the delivery schedule, authorize
   reimbursement to the Contractor of any costs incurred during performance, or otherwise change any terms and conditions of this contract or
   accept/reject deliverables.
f. The COTR/COR may be changed by the Government at any time; notification of the change, including the name and address of the successor
   COTR/COR, will be provided to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer in writing.

C.9. UNAUTHORIZED WORK.
The Contractor is not authorized at any time to commence TO performance prior to issuance of a signed TO or other written approval provided by
the CO to begin work.


C.10. TASK ORDER (TO) PROCEDURES.
Orders awarded under this contract may be Firm Fixed Priced (FFP), or Time and Materials/Labor Hour contract types.  Any Department of Education
Contracting Officer may award task orders under this contract.

C.11. TASK ORDER (TO) PROCESS.
Though this IDIQ is not a mandatory use contract for Federal Student Aid or the Department of Education, it is anticipated that the Contractor’s
services shall be obtained on an as-needed basis (i.e., through the issuance of Task Orders).  The Contractor shall perform the required effort
for these services, within the United States, throughout the term of this contract.  Issued TO will identify the services required; provide
specific technical details (including the schedule for all deliverables and the identification of any applicable Government-Furnished Property
(GFP), Government-Furnished Information (GFI) and/or Government furnished workspace.


C.12. FAIR OPPORTUNITY PROCESS.
A TO RFP number will be assigned to each task order requirement.  Unless one of the exceptions of FAR Part 16.505(b)(2) applies, the CO will
issue the TO RFP.  The issuance of the TO RFP satisfies the requirement for a fair opportunity to be considered.  Each Contractor shall evaluate
the opportunity and determine whether or not to submit a proposal.  The announcement may  include the following information:
a.   TO RFP Number;
b.   Date of Announcement;
c.   Type of Service;
d.   Statement of Objectives (SOO) or Statement of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statement (PWS);
e.   Contract Type;
f.    Government-Furnished Property (GFP);
g.   Government-Furnished Information (GFI);
h.   Incumbent Contractor, if any;
i.     CO (Name, Phone Number, email) and Contract Specialist; and
j.     Proposal submission E-mail Address/Mailing Address; and Proposal Due Date (local Washington, D.C. time).

C.13. FAIR OPPORTUNITY EXCEPTIONS.
 a.   In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) and FAR Part 16.505(B), the CO will provide all awardees a “fair
opportunity” to be considered for each order in excess of $3,000, unless one of the conditions below applies:
   1.   The agency need for such services is so urgent that providing a fair opportunity would result in unacceptable delays.
   2.   Only one awardee is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services ordered are unique
      or highly specialized.
   3.   The order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to a task
      order already issued under this contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.
   4.   It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee.
      5.   It is known that a Contractor has an unacceptable conflict of interest.
b.   In accordance with FAR Part 16.5, when an exception to the fair opportunity exists, the task order will be processed as a sole source
procurement, including a sole source justification.
c.   The regulation delegates to the Contracting Officer the responsibility of determining what procedures should be used to provide each of the
multiple awardees a fair opportunity for consideration.  The award of task orders will be made based on past performance of earlier orders under
the contract or other past performance information obtained by the CO, cost/price, and/or other unique factors designated for each task order.
The Contracting Officer may tailor the selection process for a specific task order to reflect the requirements and environment of the proposed
task order.

 C.14.  TASK ORDER REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (TO RFP) PROCESS.
a.   Initially, a Statement of Work, Statement of Objectives or Performance Work Statement for a proposed task order will be furnished to the
Contractor along with a request for a technical and cost/price proposal. The request will state whether the task order is to be fixed price or
time and materials. The due date will be set forth in each proposal request.  If unable to perform a requirement, Contractors shall submit a “no
bid” reply in response to the proposal request.  All “no bids” shall include a brief statement to the Contracting Officer as to why the
Contractor is unable to perform, i.e. conflict of interest, or has decided not to bid. Technical and cost/price negotiations will be held, if
necessary. The labor categories and loaded labor rates as listed in the Pricing Schedule, shall be utilized by the Contractor when submitting
proposals for task orders. The price for each task order shall be determined based on the estimated level of effort required to perform the work
and either the rates set forth in the Pricing Schedule or the estimated costs.
b.   Technical Proposals.  If requested, technical proposals stating compliance or exception to requirements, risks, assumptions and conflict of
interest issues will be provided. Responses will be streamlined and succinct to the extent practical based on the estimated dollar value and
complexity of the work.   Proposals shall not merely restate SOO, SOW or PWS requirements.  As stated in the TO RFP, technical proposals may
address:
   1.   Technical/Management Approach including Program Management Plan, Past Performance, etc.;
   2.   Key Personnel Assigned;
   3.   Quantities/Hours of Personnel by Labor Categories;
   4.   Performance Metrics;
   5. Period of Performance;
   6.       Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE)/Government-Furnished Information (GFI) and/or access to Government-Furnished software licenses;
   7.       Security (including clearance level);
   8.       Subcontractors and their roles (by Subcontractor); and
   9.       Other Pertinent Data
 c.   Price/Cost Proposal.  A written price/cost proposal shall always be required.  This part of the proposal shall include detailed cost/price
amounts of all resources required to accomplish the task (i.e. labor hours, rates, travel, incidental equipment, etc.).  The level of detail
required shall be primarily based on the TO type planned for use, as further discussed below.  Bases of Estimates (BOE) may be needed for
proposals.  To add labor categories beyond the Government Labor Categories, a request for contract modification must be submitted to the
Contracting Officer.  This request must include information demonstrating the insufficiency of the Government’s Labor Category, a description of
the proposed labor category, including the education and experience levels, proposed labor rates, and a cross reference to other contracts that
include the proposed labor categories.
   1.   Labor categories and rates.  In an MS Excel spreadsheet, with multiple Worksheets as required, identify the labor categories by hours,
      materials, travel, and other direct costs as required.  In addition, a Summary Worksheet in the MS Excel spreadsheet that summarizes by
      labor category the hours proposed.
   2.   Staffing plan.  Names of personnel who will be working on the task order; their labor category appropriate to their qualifications and
      effort to be contributed to the task order effort, including those of any subcontractors; and identification of key personnel.  Résumés
      will be submitted upon request or as stated in the TO RFP.
      i.    The estimated direct labor dollars (broken out by hours, categories, and rates for each month of effort) for each individual proposed
        for the task order.  The hours and rates shall be appropriate for the labor category/position title of each individual proposed.
   3.   Travel.  Proposed travel (if applicable) broken out into number of trips, number of travelers, and duration of trip (including transit
      time) for each destination.  Cost detail shall be shown for all items, including commercial transportation, daily per diem rates, personal
      mileage, daily car rental, etc.
   4.   ODC.  An explanation and basis shall be provided for each item of "Other Direct Costs" proposed, such as materials, reproduction costs,
      and proposed travel, etc.
   5.   Fixed Price and Time-and-Materials (T&M).  The proposal shall identify labor categories in accordance with the Section B, CLIN Rate
      Tables, and the number of hours required for performance of the task.  The proposal must identify and justify use of all non-labor cost
      elements.  It must also identify any Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and/or Government Furnished Information (GFI) required for TO
      performance.  If travel is specified in the TO statement of work, air fare and/or local mileage, per diem rates by total days, number of
      trips and number of Contractor employees traveling shall be included in the cost proposal.  Prior to incurring any long distance travel
      expenses, the Contractor shall obtain written approval from the TO COTR of approximate travel dates, expected duration, origin and
      destination, purpose, estimated costs and the number and names of personnel traveling.
d.  TO proposal preparation costs.  The Contractor shall assume all costs associated with the preparation of proposals for task order awards
under the fair opportunity process as an indirect charge.  The Government will not reimburse awardees for proposal preparation costs as a direct
charge.

Evaluation criteria will be established at the time the request for proposals are requested.

Unless otherwise specified in the order, all non-electronic deliverables shall be submitted to the COR (see Section C.15d below) on an ‘F.O.B.
Destination’ basis.  Preservation, packing and packaging of ‘non-electronic’ deliverables for shipment shall be in accordance with standard
commercial practices.   All electronic deliverables shall be submitted via email to the assigned PM, COR and CO.

While performing work under this contract, the Contractor shall NOT label any information produced and submitted in a way that would restrict
the Government's right to use or release the information.  If applicable, the Contractor shall include a legend that identifies sensitive data
that should not be released for security reasons.  Under FAR Clause 52.227-14, this information may be used for any purpose the Government deems
appropriate. Deliverables provided shall not contain vendor-specific logos or mottos.  The Contractor shall not use, particularly for proposals,
U.S. Government logos.

C.30.  ED 307-17 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (2007).
a.    The Contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has certified that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant
facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational
conflicts of interest), or apparent conflict of interest, for the organization or any of its staff, and that the Contractor, subcontractor,
employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with
knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the Contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant).
Conflicts may arise in the following situations:
   1. Unequal access to information – a potential Contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through
      its performance on a government contract.
   2. Biased ground rules – a potential Contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on
      the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract.
   3. Impaired objectivity – a potential Contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent
      or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of
      government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to
      recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following
      situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity:
      (i)   financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in, or in connection with, products, property, or services that may
        be purchased by an educational agency, person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by
        the Department;
      (ii)  Significant connections to teaching methodologies that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services;
        or
      (iii) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific
        curriculum, specific products, property or services,

Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential (or apparent) conflict of interest regardless of their opinion
that such a conflict would not impair their objectivity.  In a case in which an actual or potential (or apparent) conflict is disclosed, the
Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address such conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the
conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensure a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or
modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict.   In this clause, the term “potential conflict” means reasonably foreseeable
conflict of interest.
b.   The Contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if “impaired objectivity, or an actual or potential (or apparent)
conflict of interest is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This
disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting
Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential (or apparent) conflict.
c.   Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid
the appearance of a conflict of interest.  If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award, or discovered an
actual or potential (or apparent) conflict after award, and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer,
the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.  These
remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, § 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title
31, U.S. Code, § 3802.  Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.  The Contractor may also
be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest.  An example of
such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest.
d.   In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the Contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate
the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.
e.   The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially
to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e).

                                                        Conflict of Interest Certification

The Offeror, _______________________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no present or
currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or
task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. ED-FSA-09-R-0019 that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent
conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its
ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice, or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage.
 In this clause, the term “potential conflict” means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest.  The Offeror further certifies that it has and
will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government’s satisfaction, such conflicts of interest
(or apparent conflicts of interest).
