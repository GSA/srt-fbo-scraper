     (c) Documentation Submission. The NACLC for IT-II access, as well as the PTSBI for IT-I access, requires contractor submission of the
following investigative forms and documentation:




         • Standard Form 85P (SF 85P) - Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions
         • FD 258 - Applicant Fingerprint Card
         • Contractor Request for Investigation Form (CRI), DFAS Form 9035
         • Photocopies of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) documentation

All contractor personnel requiring either IT-I or IT-II access to the DFAS information systems and/or sensitive agency information will complete
a SF 85P. The SF 85P will be completed using the Adobe Fillable version of the form located at http://www.opm.gov/forms/html/sf.asp . The
completed/signed SF85P will be provided to the COR or Government Point of Contact (GPOC), elsewhere named in this solicitation. The COR/GPOC
personnel will complete a CRI containing, but not limited to: the full name of the contractor applicant; the contract number and expiration
date; the name(s) of the designated COR; and level of IT access required as determined previously in the Statement of Work or Performance Work
Statement. All SF 85Ps and CRIs must be accompanied by the FD 258, Applicant Finger Print Card, and photocopies of documentation that the
COR/GPOC have used to validate the contractor personnel applicant's PIV. In accordance with USNORTHCOM Antiterrorism (AT) Operations Order 05-
01B, dated 7/16/2006, identity credential vetting is required for access permission of contractor personnel. To meet this requirement for PIV
vetting, the contractor applicant must provide two forms of identification from the list of acceptable documents based upon the Form I-9,
Employment Eligibility Verification. At least one of the documents shall be a valid State or Federal Government issued picture identification.
The COR or GPOC will validate the documents and provide photocopies of the vetted PIV documentation as part of the documentation submission for
investigation. The SF85P, FD258, CRI, and proof of PIV will be forwarded to the local SSSO for review and/or submission. The SSSO or Central
Personnel Security Office will notify the COR/GPOC when the contractor applicant has been approved for access to sensitive information. The
appropriate personnel security investigation (NACLC or PTSBI) must be completed or an exception waiver of pre-appointment investigative
requirement approved, in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R, before the contractor personnel applicant begins work on a DFAS contract.

    (d) Findings.  All contractor personnel applicants must receive a favorable local contractor personnel fitness determination (or favorable
adjudication) to work on DFAS contracts. Unfavorable local fitness determinations (or unfavorable adjudications) will require the removal of
the contractor employee from an IT-I or IT-II designated DFAS contract. An unfavorable local fitness determination only precludes the
contractor employee from having access to sensitive DFAS IT systems or sensitive agency data. The local contractor fitness determination is not
security adjudication. Therefore, the contractor personnel applicant is not afforded administrative due process by the agency.

    (e) Training.  Following contract award, all contractor personnel are required to complete Antiterrorism Level I, Combating Trafficking in
Persons, and Information Security training on an annual basis (Reference DoDI 2000.16, Standard 25; DoDI 2200.01, paragraph 5; and DoD 5200.1-
R, Chapter 9).  The aforementioned training will be available through the DFAS ePortal.


SOLICITATION PROVISION:

DFAS 52.223-9000, “ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS” (OCT 2007)

The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Government’s polices on Green Contracting.  FAR
23.403 sets forth the Federal Government’s policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost
effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals.  Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection
Agency’s Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs).  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which
designates Bio-based products.  EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that
should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials.  Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed,
but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.

The recently issued Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) requires federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including
acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products.  Moreover, it now
requires that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.

§ 1.        Mandatory use of Paper and other products with recycled content.
All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.
The contractor, by responding to this RFP/RFQ, affirmatively acknowledges that they will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable
environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content
products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at
http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm.   In addition, by responding to this RFQ/RFP the contractor is certifying the
deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.

§ 2   Notice of Green alternatives in Offerors’ product/service.
When offering a product or service that contains Green components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-
hw/procure/products.htm,
the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their quote or proposal.
(b)   The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA
Designated Products.

§ 2   Affirmative Duty of Contractors to adhere to Green Contracting Policy.
Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or
weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.
(b)   Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this
contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-
recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.
