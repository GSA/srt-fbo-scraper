PART II – QUESTIONNAIRE INSTRUCTIONS

This questionnaire covers the topics that are in line with the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  This questionnaire is designed to provide basic information regarding the Contractor’s present/past performance results on the contracts they have been awarded with your company and your satisfaction with their performance.  



RATERS PLEASE NOTE:  Per DOD policy, a fundamental principle of assigning ratings is that contractors will not be assessed a lower than Satisfactory rating solely for not performing beyond the requirement of the contract.   



Please use the following guide in preparing your response to the below questions:  



Exceptional

Definition:  Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.

Note:  To justify an Exceptional rating, identify multiple significant events and state how they were of benefit to the Government.  A singular benefit, however, could be of such magnitude that it alone constitutes an Exceptional rating.  Also there should have been NO significant weaknesses identified.



Very Good

Definition:  Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor was effective. 

Note:  To justify a Very Good rating, identify a significant event and state how it was a benefit to the Government.  There should have been no significant weaknesses identified.



Satisfactory

Definition:  Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear to be or were satisfactory.  

Note:  To justify a Satisfactory rating, there should have been only minor problems, or major problems the contractor recovered from without impact to the contract.  There should have been NO significant weaknesses identified.  



Marginal

Definition:  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions.  The contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.

Note:  To justify Marginal performance, identify a significant event in each category that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted the Government.  A Marginal rating should be supported by referencing the management tool that notified the contractor of the contractual deficiency (e.g., management, quality, safety, or environmental deficiency report or letter).



Unsatisfactory 

Definition:  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective.

Note:  To justify an Unsatisfactory rating, identify multiple significant events in each category that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted the Government.  A singular problem, however, could be of such serious magnitude that it alone constitutes an unsatisfactory rating.  An Unsatisfactory rating should be supported by referencing the management tools used to notify the contractor of the contractual deficiencies (e.g., management, quality, safety, or environmental deficiency reports, or letters).



Not Applicable 

Definition:  Did not apply to this acquisition; or, questionnaire respondent has no knowledge of, and/or did not observe, the contractor’s performance in this area.
