52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)



(a)  The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:




   (1)  PAST PERFORMANCE




   (2)  PRICE



Past Performance is significantly more important than Price when offers are being evaluated.

(b)  Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).

(c)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,

withdrawal is received before award. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 90 calendar days from the date specified for

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that
--



(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared
ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,



(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and



(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and



(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.



(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:



(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.



(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.



(ii) Examples.



(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.



(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.



(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.



(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).





(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the

-



(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and



(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and



(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.



(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:



(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.



(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.



(ii) Examples.



(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.



(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.



(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.



(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).



(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor

The Contractor shall provide sustainment, enhancement, and integration support for FIRST/FSDM, including day-to-day system coverage, data
analysis, requirements analysis and  development, tracking/reporting resources, providing updates, and other work relating to the current
FIRST/FSDM application. A list of known requirements can be found in Section 5.2 of this document.  Core objectives for this contract are:

    • Sustain the operational FIRST/FSDM application for FSDM users
      o Maintain the FIRST/FSDM application by fixing critical defects identified in operational validation, operational testing, or operational
        use
      o Maintain and enhance the FIRST/FSDM application by fixing defects, implementing change requests, and implementing required technical
        refresh as approved by or directed by the Government through the FIRST/FSDM DR/CR process and validated through the Functional

      4  Background

The Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/ Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) is an Air Force Programming system designed to support
development of the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and the President's Budget (PB). FIRST/FSDM maintains an inventory of the Air Force's
force structure (organizations, weapon systems and flying hours) and enables the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) to prioritize and program
Air Force requirements. It also provides a historical query and analysis capability of 30+ years of Air Force budget data and submissions. It
replaces and enhances the legacy Program Data System (PDS).

FIRST/FSDM features a modern system architecture that is hosted on the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) classified integration
framework (IF) utilizing the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). FIRST/FSDM is web-based, utilizing the Oracle 11i Application
Suite. Cognos Business Intelligence is used for "what-if" analysis, ad hoc reporting, and reports generation. FIRST/FSDM maximizes the use of
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and GCSS-AF Services to deliver a system that provides a sustainable flexible, user-friendly
information system.

The Contractor shall update the RTM with each release.  The Requirements Traceability Matrix shall be a single source of documentation for
tracing requirements from the requirements baseline (SRS) to the design baseline (IADD) to the test cases in the Software Test Description
(STD).  The RTM shall clearly identify all the approved requirements from the SRS.  The RTM shall provide information sufficient for the
Government to determine which requirements have been implemented, and to determine where they are implemented in the design and verified in a
test case/script or by alternate means.  The RTM should provide information to allow the Government to determine the release in which the
requirement has been implemented or last changed due to a DR or CR.  If the definition or design of a requirement was changed due to a CR, the
RTM shall identify the CR that triggered the change.  If the implementation of a requirement was changed due to a DR, the RTM shall identify the
DR that triggered the change.

19 Minor Releases

Approved CRs and DRs will be packaged into releases by the Sustainment IPT and the Functional Requirements Review Board (FRRB).  These releases
will normally consist of no more than 10 CRs and 5 DRs with a total estimated size of between 30 and 40 function points and are expected to be
classified as minor releases under GCSS-AF policies. The Contractor shall analyze, build and test these releases in the Government provided
environments, and then support installation and testing of these releases using the CIE/GCSS-AF minor release processes.  The Contractor shall
normally complete the release from package definition to installation in less than 90 days.  The Contractor shall plan to support 3 minor
releases and an emergency release each year.




20 Emergency Releases

In cases where a DR or CR is critical and failure to fix seriously impacts the ability to test or operate the FIRST/FSDM application, the
Contractor shall use expedited processes as allowed by the CIE and GCSS-AF to provide a rapid release.  Emergency releases will normally be
limited to only one or two CRs or DRs and should be deployed within 15 days after the remedy ticket is received, approved, and sent to the
Contractor for action.

    • Release Review Process.  For each release, the Government shall conduct review of requirements, design and test readiness.  These will
      usually include an Engineering Go-No-Go decision.


23 Requirements Review.  Upon completetion of the Contractor’s analysis of

           requirements for a release, the Contractor shall submit an updated SRS and RTM.  The Government will review these documents, the
           current DR/CR list, and the Contractor Rough Orders of Magnitude (ROMs) in order to verify that all requirements to be implemented
           for the release have been adequately identified, documented, and approved and that the planned release can be completed as scheduled.
            Upon successful completion of this review, the SRS will be accepted as the requirements baseline and the contents of the release
           will be approved.  See 1.5.1.1.3 for SRS requirements and 1.5.5.1.8 for RTM requirements.




24 Design Review.  Upon completion of design for the release, the Contractor shall

           submit an updated IADD and RTM for the release.  If any requirements changes are proposed as a result of the design and approved by
           the Government, the Contractor shall also submit an updated SRS.  The Government will review these documents to verify that all
           approved requirements are incorporated into the design. Upon successful completion of this review, the IADD will be accepted as the
           design baseline.  See 1.5.5.5.7 for IADD requirements.




25 Test Readiness Review.  Upon completion of release build and development

           testing, the Contractor shall submit the Release Package for the release.  The Government will review the Release Package and use the
           Test Readiness Review Checklist to determine if the release is ready for the CIE/GCSS-AF.  Upon successful completion of this review,
           the Contractor shall deliver the Release Package to the CIE/GCSS-AF.  See 1.5.1.1.11 for Release Package requirements.

9. METHODS OF ASSESSMENT APPLICABLE TO THIS CONRACT.



9.1   Periodic Assessment/Inspection

Periodic assessment/inspection is the type of assessment that is based upon selecting samples for evaluation on other than 100% inspection or on
a statistically random basis.  Selecting this tool to determine a contractor’s compliance to contract requirements can be quite effective and
allows COR to establish confidence or lack of confidence in the contractor while not consuming a significant amount of time.  An example of
periodic assessment/inspection is weekly inspections when COR choose the location and time in other than a statistically random basis.



9.2   Customer Complaint/Feedback

Customer complaints/feedback and comments can be a way to validate information obtained through other sources. They may also provide a basis for
an incentive payment to the contractor. However, customer complaints/feedbacks are likely to be subjective and may not always relate to actual
requirements of the contract; therefore, they need to be fully validated. Customer complaints/feedback are useful in those areas that do not
lend themselves to other types of assessment.



COR should furnish written instructions and customer training to each organization receiving the contractor’s service. Instructions and training
should cover the format and content of the program and service to be surveyed; the action that may be expected from COR, contract administrator,
and CO as a result of the complaints, and the limitations on the customers in dealing with contractor personnel.  Instructions should also
clearly explain what service/level of service the customers should expect from the contractor, based on what is in the contract.



COR is the point of contact and must collect all customer complaints/feedback.  All complaints/feedbacks and any resulting resolution of such
complaints/feedback must be documented.  A locally developed form may be used for this purpose.  Customer complaint forms/feedback becomes a
permanent part of the COR assessment records.



Customer complaints/feedback may be used to assess performance in any area.  Valid customer complaints/feedbacks may be used as the basis for
adverse action against the contractor. In such cases, the Inspection of Services Clause becomes the basis for the CO’s actions.  Again, the
preferred method of correcting the defect is re-performance of the action or service at no additional cost.







9.3   One Hundred Percent Inspection

One hundred percent inspection is exactly what the title implies--inspecting a requirement every time it occurs.  Use of this technique may be
appropriate in the assessment of contract requirements that (1) have especially critical impact on mission accomplishment or safety, (2) occur
infrequently, or (3) have stringent requirements.





10.  ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES



10.1. Assessment Schedule.



10.1.1. The COR will develop an assessment schedule, based on the requirements of this QASP.  A locally devised form may be used.  The schedule
shall be completed no later than seven (7) calendar days before the beginning of the period it covers.  Copies of the assessment schedule shall
be provided to the CO, before the start of the assessment period.  Assessment schedules, when completed, shall be marked “For Official Use
Only”, and shall not be shown to the contractor.


 10.1.2. Changes to the assessment schedule shall be posted promptly.  Copies of the changed schedule shall be sent to the CO.  The COR shall
 document the reason(s) for changes of the assessment schedule, and maintain the documentation in the COR files with the corresponding changed
 assessment schedule.

 10.1.3. In addition, if anytime during the month a performance threshold is exceeded, the government representative shall immediately notify
the contracting office in writing of the finding. The CO shall then take appropriate action in accordance with the Inspection/Acceptance clause.



 10.2.      Assessment of SS Items.



 10.2.1. It is essential that the COR conduct assessments in accordance with projected assessment schedule for an effective quality assurance
 program. Mission requirements may require deviations from the assessment schedule; however, assessments should be performed as close to the
 schedule as is practicable.  COR shall document assessments as they are conducted.




 10.2.2. The COR shall conduct assessment of the contractor’s performance by determining whether or not the performance meets the standards
 contained in the contract, the PWS and the SS items.




 10.2.3.  Assessment documentation shall include as a minimum, the date, time, and location the assessment was conducted, results of the
 assessment (acceptable or unacceptable), PWS paragraph number referencing the requirement, a short description of the requirement being
 surveyed, applicable remarks, signature of COR conducting the assessment.  When COR determine that contractor performance is unacceptable, the
 specific reason for the unacceptable performance shall be recorded on the COR assessment documentation.



 10.3.  Assessment of non-SS Items.  The Government has the right to inspect all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable
 at all times and places during the term of the contract.  Therefore, COR have the right to conduct assessment for SS items and non-SS items as
 well.  When the COR identifies unacceptable performance on non-SS items, the COR shall follow the procedures in section 11. of this QASP,
 entitled Unacceptable Performance.



11.  UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE

  

11.1  Unacceptable Performance



11.1.1. When the contractor’s performance is deemed unacceptable, COR will determine the cause of the unacceptable performance.  If any
Government action, or lack of action, caused or contributed to the unacceptable performance, the unacceptable performance will not be counted
against the contractor.  The COR will take action to ensure Government action, or lack of action, does not interfere with the Contractor’s
performance in the future.  The COR will completely document the circumstances.



11.1.2. When the unacceptable performance is not the result of Government action, or lack of action, COR shall promptly notify the contractor
and issues a Corrective Action Report (CAR) to the contractor to assure corrective action is taken.  By initialing and dating the CAR, the
contractor is acknowledging that she/he has been informed of the unacceptable performance and is not agreeing with the performance assessment.
COR shall direct the contractor to re-perform the service, if possible, without additional cost to the Government.  If the contractor challenges
the validity of the COR unacceptable assessment finding, and the COR and contractor cannot come to an agreement, the matter shall be referred to
the CO for resolution.  The contractor shall be required to return all completed CAR’s to the COR no later than the suspense date indicated on
the CAR.



11.1.3. Unacceptable performance re-performed by the service provider shall still count as unacceptable performance.



11.1.4. The COR shall maintain a CAR log of all CAR’s issued to the Contractor (a locally devised form may be used). The CAR log shall contain
the CAR number, date issued, contractor, description of unacceptable performance, suspense date, and closeout date.  All CAR’s and CAR logs
shall be maintained by the COR for the life of the contract.



11.2. Contracting Officer (CO) Notification.



11.2.1. Major Finding.  If at any time COR identify a condition as having a significant adverse effect on the quality of the activity, such as
those stated below, COR will document their findings and notify the CO immediately in writing.  E-mail is acceptable.


11.2.1.1. Contractor failure to meet a Performance Threshold.

11.2.1.2. Failure to provide adequate corrective action to preclude reoccurrence of Government identified findings.


11.2.1.3. Failure to provide corrective action to deficiencies identified by the contractor within a prescribed suspense period.



11.2.1.4. Any failure to adhere to security regulations that results in a security incident.



11.2.2. Minor Finding.  A departure from established standards having little bearing on the service provided.  When COR identify a minor
finding, the COR shall document the findings, but is not required to notify the CO.  However, if the same minor finding is repeatedly
identified, it may be an indication that a major finding is occurring or has occurred because the Contractor has not taken proper steps to
prevent recurrence.  In this case, the COR shall notify the CO in writing.



11.3. Remedies for Unacceptable Performance.


11.3.1. In accordance with the contract Inspection of Services clause, if any of the services do not conform to contract requirements, the
Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity, at no increase in contract amount. This includes but is not
limited to termination of Contractor personnel and recruitment of substitute personnel that are equally qualified within established timeframes.
 When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may:

11.3.1.1. Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and

11.3.1.2. Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.  This may include a reduction in the number of paid
hours to reflect the total non-performance period.

11.3.2. If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in
conformity with contract requirements, the Government may:

11.3.2.1. By contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the Contractor any cost incurred by the Government that is directly
related to the performance of such service; or

11.3.2.2. Decrement invoice as stated in the PWS related to performance; or

11.3.2.3. Terminate the contract.


12.  CONTRACT MANAGER NOTIFICATION.



The COR will ensure that the contract manager/project manager is informed of contract performance status.  The contract manager/project manager
should also be informed of any contract discrepancies noted during COR assessment.



13.  DISCREPANCY REPORTING.

The COR will notify the contract manager/project manager of any discrepancies noted during the COR inspections.  This notification is for
discrepancy correction only and does not indicate concurrence of the discrepancy by the contractor.  The COR will also notify the CA of all
discrepancies noted during the assessment.  The frequency and method of notification to the CA will be provided to the COR during phase II
training.


 14.  CERTIFICATION OF SERVICES.


 14.1. Certification of services is performed by COR via Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system.   At the end of each billing period, service provider
 inputs invoice information in the WAWF system.  WAWF automatically notifies appropriate COR via email of pending invoice.  COR accesses WAWF and
 verifies accuracy of service provider’s data.  If data is correct, COR certifies invoice and payment is conducted by Defense Finance Accounting
 System (DFAS).  If COR encounters errors in service provider’s invoice, COR consults with on site manager to mutually rectify data.  If service
 provider disagrees with COR, issue is forwarded to the CO for resolution.


 14.2. COR are responsible for obtaining, scheduling, and completing WAWF training from the base Accounting and Finance Office.


 15.  CONTRACT MANAGEMENT.


15.1. The multi-functional team shall utilize the following approaches, methods, and tools to manage the contract upon award:


15.2. COR shall conduct, document, track, and analyze contractor performance via regularly scheduled assessments.  The assessment results shall
be maintained as Past Performance Information and utilized to prepare and support annual Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS)
reporting if applicable.  Assessment results, along with the contractor’s submittals will be used to develop metrics to track Contractor’s
overall compliance with contract terms and conditions.



15.3. The MFT team shall conduct periodic progress meetings, at least annually, to review the contractor’s performance.  At these meetings the
CO will apprise the contractor of how the Government views the contractor’s performance and the contractor will apprise the Government of
problems, if any, being experienced.  The contractor will also notify the CO, in writing, of any work being performed, if any, that the
contractor considers over and above the requirements of the contract.  Appropriate action shall be taken to resolve any outstanding issues.



16.  CONTRACTOR RATING.



Contractor Performance Assessment Rating (CPAR) is applicable to all service contracts valued over $1,000,000.  Guidance on CPARS is available
from the Department of the Air Force CPARS Guide and the 42 CONS CPARS focal points.





17.  REVIEW & ACCEPTANCE.



The following Multi-Functional Team member signatures indicate their review and acceptance of the Performance Plan for FIRST/FSDM services.
These signatures indicate coordination on this performance plan at the time of development.  These team members are not the only individuals on
the MFT but are the individuals that will have continual interface with this contract.  No further Multi-Functional Team coordination is needed
unless the intent of the Performance Plan is changed.

                                                   Corrective Action Report (CAR) Instructions


Block 1.  Enter Contractor Name.



Block 2.  Enter Contract Number.



Block 3.  Enter Contract Name or Type of Services.



Block 4.  Enter Functional Area of the Contract.



Block 5.  Enter the assigned suspense date given the contractor to provide a response to the CAR.  A date must be entered for a Major CAR.  A
date is optional at the discretion of the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) initiating the CAR if the finding is Minor.


Block 6.  All CARs will be tracked with a Control Number. The functional commander/functional director is the Issuing Authority for his/her
contract CORs generating CARs.  By providing the control number to the COR originating the CAR, the Issuing Authority demonstrates concurrence
with the finding.  The control number will be made up of the first two letters of the name of the site or contract, the last two digits of the
calendar year, and a three digit number starting with 001 and progressing upward throughout the calendar year (e.g., WP04-001).



Block 7.

1.  Check the block that indicates whether the identified deficiency is assigned as a Major or Minor finding.  See Quality Assurance
Surveillance Plan (QASP), paragraph 6.1.4, for the definitions of Major and Minor findings and associated explanations.

2.  Finding:  Clearly state the details of the finding followed by a reference to the stated contractual requirement.  The reference must state
the portion of the contract, part, section, paragraph and subparagraph and must make a complete brief quotation of the contract reference.

3.  State the impact that the finding has or could have on the accomplishment of the mission that the contract provides.

4.  When determining how long to give the contractor to respond to the identified finding, the normal is 10 working days.  The suspense date
should reflect this unless the finding requires a greater amount of time to come to solution.  Major findings require a contractor response.
Minor findings may require a contractor response at the discretion of the COR initiating the CAR and/or the Issuing Authority.



Blocks 8 and 9.  Contract CORs initiating a CAR must sign in Block 8 and the Issuing Authority signs in Block 9.  Each annotates the date at the
time of signature.



Block 10.  Upon review of the contractor’s reply, the originator of the CAR will enter comments regarding acceptance or rejection of the
contractor’s response.  This block may also contain any comments regarding follow-on inspections conducted or needed at a later date to validate
that the finding has not reoccurred.



Block 11.  The COR selects Accept or Reject after reviewing the contractor’s response.



Block 12.  The COR enters a close date after advising the Issuing Authority that the contractor’s response is acceptable and the Issuing
Authority concurs.  The Issuing Authority will then forward the closed CAR to the contractor and report accordingly in the monthly Certificate
Of Service (COS) or other applicable contracting officer services report.  This routing remains the same if the contractor response is
unacceptable and the CAR remains open until an acceptable response is received except that the Issuing Authority forwards the open CAR back to
the contractor for additional information.



Continuation Sheet.  The Continuation Sheet is to be used to expand on any information that will not fit in the applicable numbered block.

ADDENDA TO 52.212-1 PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS

A.  To assure timely and equitable evaluation of the proposal, the offeror must follow the instructions contained herein. The proposal must be
complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirements of this solicitation, or it will be considered nonresponsive.   The response
shall consist of two (2) separate parts; Part I – Price Proposal, and Part II – Past Performance Information.

B.   This firm fixed-price acquisition is set-aside for competition among SBA certified 8(a) program participants. The Contracting Officer has
determined there is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible and responsible 8(a) firms will be able to fulfill this requirement and
that an award can be made at a fair market price. Only offers from certified 8(a) businesses will be accepted.

        The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination
of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer’s opinion, adequate price
competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required.  However, if at
any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists offerors may be required to
submit information other than cost or pricing data to support a determination of price reasonableness.

C.  Specific Instructions:

1.  PART I – PRICE PROPOSAL - Submit original hardcopy and one (1) electronic copy.

   (a)  Complete blocks 12, 17a, and 30a, b, and c of the SF1449. In doing so, the offeror accedes to the contract terms and conditions as
written in the SOLICITATION, with attachments. The SOLICITATION constitutes the model contract.

   (b)  Insert proposed unit and extended prices in the Pricing Schedule for Contract Line Item Number  (CLIN) 0001, 1001, 2001, and 3001, Only.
All other CLINs are Cost Reimbursable and price quotes are not required. .  The extended amount must equal the whole dollar unit price
multiplied by the number of units.  The proposal(s) must be submitted for a base year plus three (3) Option Years.

   (c)  Complete the necessary fill-ins and certifications in provisions. The provisions FAR 52.212-3 shall be returned along with the proposal.

2.  PART II – PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION - Only references for same or similar type contracts are desired.  Submit original hardcopy and one
(1) electronic copy.

   (a)  Quality and Satisfaction Rating for Contracts Completed in the Past Three Years: Provide information currently available (letters,
metrics, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrates customer satisfaction with overall job performance and quality of
completed product for same or similar type contract. In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard
performance and any current performance problems such as cost overruns, extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc. The
present/past performance provided should demonstrate the contractor’s efforts in essentially the same magnitude and complexity as required by
this solicitation. Please differentiate if the contractor has served as a prime or as a subcontractor for each instance of past/present
performance.

   (b)  Past Performance Surveys: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror’s performance deemed relevant to the
requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal
government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance.  Provide a list of no more than ten (10), of the most relevant contracts
performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers within the last three years.  Relevant contracts include present/past performance
efforts involving essential the same magnitude of effort and complexity as the work required to satisfy the attached Performance Work Statement
and the requirements of this solicitation.  The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information
regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of
the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Furnish the following information for each contract referenced:

      (i) Company/Division name

      (ii) Product/Service

      (iii) Contracting Agency/Customer

      (iv) Contract Number

      (v) Contract Dollar Value

      (vi) Period of Performance

      (vii) Verified, up-to-date name, address, FAX and telephone number of the contracting officer

      (viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions

      (ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and
conditions.

Current performance will generally have greater impact in the performance assessment than recent performance.  Performance that is more recent
will usually have more impact than less recent performance.  Current is generally defined as performance that is taking place at the present
time.  Recent is generally defined as performance occurring within the last three years, but the time period can be tailored to fit the
circumstances of your acquisition.

 “Relevant” means the performance being considered must have a logical connection to the work described in the solicitation.  Normally,
relevance would include such aspects as the product or service similarity, product or service complexity, contract type, program or lifecycle
phase, contract environment, division of company proposing, subcontractor interaction and magnitude.  Magnitude is important because it will
define not only the scope but project similarity to the instant requirement.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration
should be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor.  The evaluation will
take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors
that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.  The following
relevancy definitions are examples of general language that can be used, or tailored if appropriate:




|Very Relevant                     |Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and        |
|                                  |complexities this solicitation requires.                                                     |
|Relevant                          |Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities    |
|                                  |this solicitation requires.                                                                  |
|Somewhat Relevant                 |Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and     |
|                                  |complexities than this solicitation requires.                                                |
|Not Relevant                      |Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and           |
|                                  |complexities this solicitation requires.                                                     |

52.212-2 ADDENDUM
BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive source selection limited to 8(a) vendors in which competing offerors’ past and present
performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the
instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions To Offerors, and its addendum, the offeror accedes to the terms and conditions of
this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall
proceed as follows:

A. Initially offers shall be ranked according to price, including option prices. An offeror’s proposed prices will be determined by multiplying
the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the unit price for each item to confirm the extended amount for each Contract Line Item
Number (CLIN).  Offerors must complete CLIN 0001 information for the base period and all option periods.  The second and third CLINS are Cost
Reimbursable therefore the offeror is not required to provide a price for CLINs 0002, 0003, 1002, 1003, 2002, 2003, 3002, and 3003.

B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on each offeror via completed questionnaires
received directly from the offeror’s references.  Offerors must provide a blank questionnaire to each reference and provide the reference
instruction to complete and send the questionnaire directly to the 42d Contracting Squadron points of contact no later than the proposal due
date.  No completed questionnaires will be accepted directly from an offeror.  Also, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance
information on each offeror via data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.  Relevant performance includes
performance of efforts involving efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this
solicitation.  The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a
“Substantial Confidence” performance assessment rating.  The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the
offeror’s ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past performance.  The
assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence,
Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence as defined in Table B1, below.  Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key
personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered
as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the
offeror’s performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating “Unknown
Confidence”, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.

Assessment Ratings

   Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully
   perform the required effort.


   Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully
   perform the required effort.


   Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform
   the required effort.


   No Confidence: Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully
   perform the required effort.


   Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror’s performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment
   rating can be reasonably assigned.

Completed Past Performance Questionnaires will be reviewed after receipt from the three references requested by the offeror. The offeror is
responsible for ensuring that these completed questionnaires reach the 42d Contracting Squadron.


C.  In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed
most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.

D.  If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a “Substantial Confidence” performance rating and is determined to be responsible,
that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror
without further consideration of any other offers.

E.  If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a “Substantial Confidence” performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be
evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a “Substantial Confidence” performance assessment
or until all offerors are evaluated.  The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.

F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a
meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past
performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse past performance is defined as past
performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from
sources without a formal rating system.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the
contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.

G. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to
conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.
