1.0 General Objective and Project Background:

The purpose of ITLA/COLDS Release 2 project is to provide a Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tool for the development of an on-line probe and
response tax law guide to be used Internally by IRS assistors and externally by taxpayers and/or tax professionals. The purpose of this SOO is
to obtain contractor support and training required to conduct the knowledge transfer necessary for Internal (IRS) staff members to update and
maintain existing Tax Law Categories (TLCs) as well as Create and Maintain New TLCs.

The project consists of a Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint (TAB) initiative to develop a Probe & Response guide for taxpayers and a business
initiative called Interactive Tax Law Assistant (ITLA).The ITLA project developed 45 Tax Law Categories (TLCs) and displayed them through
Service-wide Electronic Resource Program (SERP) internally for customer service representatives in November 2007. The combined ITLA/COLDS R2
project has been deployed in two phases. Phase A involved deploying additional TLCs for the internal customers.  In Phase B, the application was
deployed on irs.gov for use by taxpayers.  The project utilized Oracle’s Policy Modeling and Automation suite to provide the subject matter
experts with a tool to easily update and manage the TLCs.  The project has already built several TLCs utilizing this software that were deployed
during Phase A.   Further, the project has also purchased several licenses of the Oracle Determinations Engine, the application used to display
the business rules. The IRS will also use Oracle to provide technical integration and ongoing professional services support.

2.0 Contract Objectives:

This section describes the potential level of support services needed by Oracle at the direction of the ITLA/COLDS R2 Project Manager.  Support
may include the following:
     1. ITLA/COLDS R2 General development and Integration support and 2010 O&M
        a. Rule-based tasks as needed under general support hours. Provide a high level workflow/job aid doc that captures the process of
           deploying ITA from beginning to end.
        b. Provide support, resolution and guidance to issues that may arise during the Field Validation, Communication and Language, and the
           Legal Review Process that each “Plain Speak” TLC will undergo before production launch.
        c. Support performance, user, security, and/or 508 testing with Oracle Policy products to ensure compliance of regulations and
           optimization of functionality can be obtained. (This is technical support to meet IRS requirements. PPB, UAT etc.)
        d. Support application integration into the Accenture / IRS.gov environment. (This is the support for the Accenture process for
           deploying WAR file to the IRS.gov site.)
        e. Support capacity testing and deployment activities as required. 
        f. Assist with implementing applications onto IRS website(s) and/or configuration of style sheets to display the data as directed. (This

        h. Assist with operations and maintenance support for the current operations environment associated with Oracle Policy products.
