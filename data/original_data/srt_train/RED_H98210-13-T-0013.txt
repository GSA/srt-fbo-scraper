STATEMENT OF WORK
                                                        DCPDS Life Cycle Replacement (LCR)

1.  INTRODUCTION:   The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Services (DCPAS) requires
brand name software and hardware devices to replace products that have reached end of life in the Defense Civilian Personnel Database System
(DCPDS).

2.  BACKGROUND:  Items in this procurement package include software and hardware devices that support LCR of equipment to include items required
for the continued analysis, implementation, and development of the Enhanced Data Delivery Management (EDDM) system for the DCPDS program.  This
equipment and software replacement/upgrades provide ongoing support for the Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) and is integral
to the sustainment and operations of all DCPDS enclaves.  Since DCPDS is based on existing hardware, software, and proven devices already in
production on this unique enterprise automated human resources (HR) system, the requested servers make up the sole solution that meet the
minimum technical requirements necessary for the operation of this system in the production and System Qualification Testing (SQT) environments.
 These specific devices are required as a single package since they directly integrate with existing equipment and software packages that are
already in use and are fully integrated across each element contained within this procurement package.

3. SCOPE:   The contractor shall provide hardware/software brand products, including Hewlett Packard, (HP), Red Hat, JBOSS, Adobe, Microsoft,
Corning, Adobe, Solarwinds, CISCO and Blue Coat as detailed at paragraphs 4.1 thru 4.4 below.

4. REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall:
