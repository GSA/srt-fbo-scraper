STATEMENT OF WORK " Indian Health Service Active Directory/Exchange Provisioning Implementation "
1. BACKGROUND The Indian Health Service (IHS) is the principal Federal health care provider and health advocate for American Indian people, and provides a comprehensive health services delivery system for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The range of services includes traditional inpatient, ambulatory care, preventive care, and population health, delivered through a network of hospitals and clinics distributed through 35 states. The IHS Office of Information Technology (OIT) is charged with establishing and maintaining the information technology systems that support the health care and public health mission of IHS. These services include a secure nationwide network, electronic mail, inter- and intranet web services and applications, a national data warehouse, and a comprehensive suite of health information software. 2. OBJECTIVE This project has four overall, related objectives: a. To provide a Commercial product and associated installation/configuration services that would allow for the customization, design and development of a Messaging Resource Management solution that will address all of the functional requirements identified. Initially, this solution would apply only to Microsoft Exchange. However, it must allow for inclusion of other products in the future (e.g., Instant Messaging). The solution must be a centralized system that allows for decentralized administration and delegated permissions with restoration of basic e-mail management functions to the IT staff in the field at IHS Areas. b. To provide a Commercial product and associated installation/configuration services that would allow for the customization, design and development of an Active Directory (AD) resource management solution that will also address all of the AD functional requirements (identified below) and allows for standardized management of all AD objects. This product would be expected to functionally replace the Microsoft Management Console for Active Directory Users and Computers (for day to day administration of both AD and Exchange). This product should require minimal customization for full functionality. c. To encompass full life cycle management of accounts to include the creation, day-to-day administration, and de-provisioning by an automated workflow process.
d.

Ability to integrate with any tools identified for the Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) solution for centralized management and maintaining to all of the identified functional requirements for FICAM. Additionally, the completed solution should allow IHS to communicate directly or indirectly with identity anagement tools adopted by other Divisions such as for standardization of AIX and Resource & Patient Management (RPMS) logical access configurations and controls. 1|Page

Final recommendations and End of Engagement Report 4.3 Active Directory Functional Requirements of Commercial product 4.3.1. AD Attribute Standards Requirements 1. Provide an interface that exposes all of HHS standard attributes (like msExchangeAssitantName which is the Location attribute in HHS). Some attributes that HHS has standardized on are not exposed in the Exchange Management Console or the ADUC. These need to be made available, so they can be managed/edited. 2. Provide appropriate labels for all HHS standard attribute fields. For example:   OPDIV to replace Company Blackberry PIN to replace customattribute7 6|Page



Location to replace msExchangeAssitantName

3. Be able to handle custom attributes. 4. Be able to handle cleanup of non-standard AD attributes. A tool that "chokes" when it encounters non-standard attributes would cause problems. 5. Be able to create resource accounts as well as IHS user mailbox accounts, and be able to create these using different rule sets; e.g., applying one set of standards to an IHS user and another set of standards to a resource account. 4.3.2. Bi-directional Synchronization IHS has a mandate from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support bi-directional exchange of data. Currently IHS uses code to clean up the IHS data before it is replicated to HHS. This is time-consuming and resource intensive. 4.3.3. Account Creation and Management Requirements The new solution must provide all the native Microsoft AD functionality, including: 1. Ability to create AD accounts and assign them to groups. 2. Ability to create/modify account profile options such as login scripts. 3. Movement of AD accounts between OUs. Users often move from one site or Area to another. But Administrators have permission over only their own OUs. 4. Creation and maintenance of computer objects; specifically:      Computer object security groups. Computer object services. Computer object shares. Manage computer object event viewers. Provisioning of service accounts.

5. Ability to create standard user templates/workflow, so that user accounts don't have to be added manually to groups upon creation. 6. Forced placement of AD objects into their appropriate Organizational Units (OUs); specifically, computer accounts when first joined to the domain. 7. Creation and maintenance of group objects. 8. Creation and maintenance of contact objects. 7|Page

9. Automatic disablement of non-service AD accounts.   Note the difference between IHS user accounts, which are integrated with HHS, and service accounts. Requirements for each are different. Automatic notification when an account is disabled to the appropriate Administrator, who is responsible for deleting the account after the prescribed period (90 days).

4.3.4. Other AD Functional Requirements 1. Support a web interface for the Admin functionality deployed to the field; i.e., no client-side software would be required. (Preferred.) 2. Restoration and rollback:    Automated restoration of AD objects. Ability to restore to a known point in the past (a minimum of 30 days, but should be customizable). Group Policy rollback to previous version (nice-to-have).

3. Delegation of granular authority from headquarters within areas, offices, and sites. 4. Querying capabilities for AD objects (e.g., dormant accounts, computer objects, group objects), and reporting capabilities in general. a. Cross-referencing querying capabilities for AD account objects, with delegation capabilities (e.g., report to show accounts that are in a group and have a specific logon script). b. General security reporting. (nice-to-have) 5. A mechanism to enforce AD attribute standards, both at initial creation and throughout the life cycle of an AD object. For example, the SMTP address in AD can be no more than 30 characters long, due to length limits imposed by the federal timekeeping system ("ITAS"). 6. Creation of a user's AD account and mailbox in a single operation (nice-to-have). 7. Ability to view Active Directory "effective permissions" for account objects. 4.4. Exchange Functional Requirements of Commercial product 4.4.1. Three-Tiered Administration Model Provide a three-tiered administration model where Tier 1 has very little control, Tier 2 has some delegated control, and Tier 3 (CES) has full control. 8|Page

1. Enable Tier 1 and Tier 2 Administrators to manage limited aspects of mail resources directly. Examples: a. Allow:      Modifying SMTP address of contacts. Controlling delivery restrictions to mail resources (for example, who can send to a contact, group, or mailbox). Hiding an object from the Global Address List (GAL). Modifying mailbox user first and last names, which will cause a new email address to be generated. Modifying group aliases, which will cause a new e-mail address to be generated.

b. But disallow:  Directly modifying existing mailbox and group email addresses. Force Administrators to update the appropriate fields to modify the email address of mailboxes and groups. Modifying mailbox storage limits. Managing user mailbox permissions or Send As rights. (Doing so would circumvent established DIS policies regarding access to other users' data.) But allow them to manage permissions on resource mailboxes and groups. Unchecking the Recipient Policy Adherence checkbox on mailboxes and distribution groups.

 



2. Provide limited Exchange administrative access without requiring native Exchange permissions. 3. Provide Administrators with a mechanism to automate redundant/bulk tasks. (Workflow) 4. Provide a mechanism to differentiate permissions for creating an object, modifying an object, and deleting an object. 4.4.2. Mailbox Object Creation Requirements 1. Provide the ability to create a Mailbox Object at the same time that the AD user account is created, using Exchange 2007/2010 supported methods. 2. Provide a method for adding individual attribute-specific warnings, instructions, or disclaimers in the user interface used for Mailbox Object creation near specific attributes, such as DisplayName, Firstname, Lastname, etc. For example, users need to be informed about naming criteria/requirements when creating a mailbox; e.g., do not put a generational qualifier or title in the Firstname or Lastname name fields. 9|Page

3. Select the least mailbox populated database for a new Mailbox Object, preferably in an automated fashion. 4. Ensure that all IHS AD attribute standards, as defined in the AD Attribute Standards for IHS document, are enforced. For example, make sure that generational/titles do not appear in the Firstname or Lastname field due to automatic email address generation. 5. Create resource accounts as well as IHS user mailbox accounts, but be able to create these using different rule sets; e.g., applying one set of attribute standards to an IHS user, another set of standards to a shared mailbox, and yet another set of standards to a room resource mailbox. 6. Enhance user-to-user interaction by creating new accommodating AD fields such as Title, Professional Designation, or Rank. 4.4.3. Mailbox Object Management Requirements 1. Provide a method for adding individual attribute-specific warnings, instructions, or disclaimers in the user interface used for Mailbox Object management near specific attributes, such as DisplayName, Firstname, Lastname, etc. 2. Provide a way for Administrators to be able to see the size of their users' mailboxes in near real time, even if this is on an individual per-mailbox basis. 3. Support a granular and tiered administration model like the one described in Requirement #1 above. 4. Prevent Area Administrators from managing user mailbox permissions. (Doing so would circumvent established DIS policies regarding access to other users' data.) But allow them to manage permissions on resource mailboxes. 5. Alert Administrators automatically when a Mailbox Object is mis-configured or malformed, such as when an attribute does not conform to the IHS standards. 4.4.4. Contact Object Requirements 1. Provide the ability to mail-enable a Contact Object at the same time that the AD Contact Object is created, using Exchange 2007/2010 supported methods. 2. Automatically uncheck Recipient Policy Adherence when a new contact object is created to prevent @ihs.gov from being appended to a contact's email address. 3. Update the primary e-mail address in both the Mail and ProxyAddresses attributes when an e-mail address is changed. Unchecking the Recipient Policy Adherence option causes the native tools to not update both addresses when one is updated, and they need to match at all times. 10 | P a g e

4. Support a granular and tiered administration model like the one described in Requirement #1 above. 5. Alert Administrators automatically when a Contact Object is misconfigured or malformed, such as when the Recipient Policy Adherence option is not disabled or an attribute does not conform to the IHS standards. 4.4.5. Group Object Requirements 1. Provide the ability to mail-enable a Group Object at the same time that the AD Universal group is created, using Exchange 2007/2010 supported methods. 2. Provide a method for adding warnings, instructions, or disclaimers to the user interface used for Group Object creation near specific attributes. For example:   To inform a user about naming criteria/requirements when creating a group (i.e., including an Area/site/etc. identifier in the name). To explain what the "Require Authentication" checkbox means for groups, so that the Administrator knows to uncheck it if the groups should accept email from outside users.

3. Enable group owners to manage their own distribution groups; that is, add/remove people without going through Tier 1 or Tier 2. 4. Support a granular and tiered administration model like the one described in Section 4.4.1 above. 5. Enable end-users to request membership in a distribution group; i.e., "subscribe." (Workflow) 6. Alert Administrators automatically when a Group Object is mis-configured or malformed, such as when an attribute does not conform to the IHS standards. 4.4.6. Other Exchange Requirements 1. Provide ability to mail-enable a public folder. End-users can manage permissions on public folders right now. 2. Provide auditing and change management of any administrative changes made with the tool. 3. Provide overall messaging resource reporting per Area. For example:    Total number of mailboxes. Number of mailboxes over 500 MB. Messaging statistics. 11 | P a g e

4. Provide user administration capabilities for other "infrastructure" applications beyond AD and Exchange, such as supporting the future CES initiative of deploying Lync 2010 this year (i.e., provide a mechanism to "Lync-Enable" a user within the same console). 5. Use a different Exchange team controlled service account for Exchange management than the one(s) used for AD permissions. 6. The management tool "back end" must be fault tolerant and highly available so that a single component failure does not significantly impact end-user access. Additionally, the solution must support an active/passive datacenter DR model. 7. The management tool "back end" must support a 100% fully virtual infrastructure. 8. Provide a mechanism to allow IHS staff to force end users to update to the latest client version if a "fat" client is deployed. 9. Provide a mechanism to maintain web interface customizations between upgrades. 10. Provide a mechanism to provide a highly customized web interface to a select group of users (such as those that issue PIV cards and only need to see a few attributes for a user). 11. Provide a mechanism to support relabeling Attributes in the end user interface, but not in AD itself, such as changing the display of "Company" to "OPDIV". This includes not displaying the same attribute in another screen as the original attribute name which would confuse end users.

4.6.

General/Future Requirements 1. Workflow automation. For example:   Adding a user to certain distribution groups automatically when the mailbox is created. Moving an account from one OU to another in a single operation.

2. Messaging resource management reporting/auditing. Right now, if a change is made to an AD account, the CES team needs ETS to tell them who made the change. CES wants to be able to query when someone has made a change to messaging aspects of resources. 3. Overall messaging resource reporting per Area. For example:    Total number of mailboxes. Number of mailboxes over 500 MB. Messaging statistics.

4. Flexibility and extensibility. An open framework that can integrate with other systems and could be expanded for future functionality. 5.

ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS 1. Contractors operating in the state of New Mexico are subject to payment of the New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax (NM GRT). The NM GRT rate is presently 6.25% of all receipts; prospective Contractors are advised to research the details with the state of New Mexico. The tax may not be added to Contractor invoices as Other Direct Costs, because the federal government does not pay state taxes; payment of NM GRT should be considered part of the contract overhead cost. 2. The Contractor shall have a complete understanding of the IHS security policy and procedures and comply with such security requirements, including user access and verification requirements such as levels of access, password protection and firewalls. The Contractor shall comply with all Federal physical security requirements at all facilities housing the activities under this contract. 3. The Contractor shall follow IHS policies concerning information security and access to IHS systems. An Interconnect Security Agreement (ISA) between IHS and the Contractor will be required for any continued remote access longer than six months for support purposes. Current policy also requires all contractor staff performing work on IHS projects and/or connecting to IHS systems for longer than six months to have a Background Investigation (BI) and to possess a Personal Identification Verification (PIV) card. The BI and PIV processes must be initiated during hiring, and the initial fingerprint screen must be complete before the individual is permitted to connect to IHS systems. The Contractor shall ensure that no prospective hires appear on the Office of Inspector General (OIG) exclusion list of convicted felons (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov/). All costs associated with Background Investigation and PIV card issuance are to be borne by the Contractor; the Government will conduct the BI and card issuance and will advise the Contractor of the costs. 15 | P a g e

To the extent feasible and consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, the Contractor further agrees to give preference in employment and training opportunities under this contract to Indians who are not fully qualified to perform regardless of age (subject to existing laws and regulations), sex, religion, or tribal affiliation. The Contractor also agrees to give preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises in the awarding of any subcontracts to the extent feasible and consistent with the efficient performance of this contract. The Contractor shall maintain statistical records as are necessary to indicate compliance with this paragraph. (b) In connection with the Indian employment preference requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall provide opportunities for training incident to such employment. Such training shall include on-the--job, classroom or apprenticeship training which is designed to increase the vocational effectiveness of an Indian employee. (c) If the Contractor is unable to fill its employment and training opportunities after giving full consideration to Indians as required by this clause, the Contractor may satisfy those needs by selecting persons other than Indians in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled "Equal Opportunity." (d) If no Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises are available under reasonable terms and conditions, including price, for awarding of subcontracts in connection with the work performed under this contract, the Contractor agrees to comply with the provisions of this contract involving utilization of small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; servicedisabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses. (e) As used in this clause, (1) "Indian" means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe.

(2) "Indian Tribe" means an Indian Tribe, pueblo, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601) which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.

(End of clause) 352.270-3 Indian preference program. Indian Preference Program (January 2006) (a) In addition to the requirements of the clause of this contract entitled ``Indian Preference,'' the Contractor agrees to establish and conduct an Indian preference program which will expand opportunities for Indians to receive preference for employment and training in connection with the work to be performed under this contract, and which will expand the opportunities for Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises to receive a preference in the awarding of subcontracts. In this connection, the Contractor shall perform the following: (1) Designate a liaison officer who will maintain liaison with the Government and the Tribe(s) on Indian preference matters; supervise compliance with the provisions of this clause; and administer the Contractor's Indian preference program. (2) Advise its recruitment sources in writing and include a statement in all advertisements for employment that Indian applicants will be given preference in employment and training incident to such employment. (3) Not more than 20 calendar days after award of the contract, post a written notice in the Tribal office of any reservations on which or near where the work under this contract is to be performed that sets forth the Contractor's employment needs and related training opportunities. The notice shall include the approximate numbers and types of employees needed; the approximate dates of employment; the experience or special skills required for employment, if any; training opportunities available; and other pertinent information necessary to advise prospective employees of any other employment requirements.

The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to contact in regard to the posting of notices and requests for Tribal assistance. (4) Establish and conduct a subcontracting program which gives preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises as subcontractors and suppliers under this contract. The Contractor shall give public notice of existing subcontracting opportunities and, to the extent feasible and consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, shall solicit bids or proposals only from Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises. The Contractor shall request assistance and information on Indian firms qualified as suppliers or subcontractors from the Tribe(s) on or near whose reservation(s) the work under the contract is to be performed. The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to be contacted in regard to the request for assistance and information. Public notices and solicitations for existing subcontracting opportunities shall provide an equitable opportunity for Indian firms to submit bids or proposals by including--: (i) A clear description of the supplies or services required, including quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules which facilitate the participation of Indian firms; (ii) A statement indicating that preference will be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises in accordance with section 7(b) of Public Law 93­638 [88 Stat. 2205; 25 U.S.C. 450e(b)]; (iii) Definitions for the terms ``Indian organization'' and ``Indian-owned economic enterprise'' as prescribed under the ``Indian Preference'' clause of this contract; (iv) A statement to be completed by the bidder or offeror that it is an Indian organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise; and (v) A closing date for receipt of bids or proposals which provides sufficient time for preparation and submission of a bid or proposal. If after soliciting bids or proposals from Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, no responsive bid or acceptable proposal is received, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the ``Indian Preference'' clause of this contract. If one or more responsible bids or acceptable proposals are received, award shall be made to the low responsible bidder or acceptable offeror if the price is determined to be reasonable. If the low responsive bid or acceptable proposal is determined to be unreasonable as to price, the Contractor shall attempt to negotiate a reasonable price and award a subcontract. If a reasonable price cannot be agreed upon, the Contractor shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the ``Indian Preference'' clause of this contract. (5) Maintain written records under this contract which indicate-- (i) The numbers of Indians seeking employment for each employment position available under this contract; (ii) The number and types of positions filled by Indians and non-Indians;

(6) Submit to the Contracting Officer for approval a quarterly report which summarizes the Contractor's Indian preference program and indicates the number and types of available positions filled by Indians and non-Indians, and the dollar amounts of all subcontracts awarded to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises, and to all other firms. (7) Maintain records pursuant to this clause and keep them available for review by the Government for one year after final payment under this contract, or for such longer period as may be required by any other clause of this contract or by applicable law or regulation. (b) For purposes of this clause, the following definitions of terms shall apply: (1) The terms ``Indian,'' ``Indian Tribe,'' ``Indian Organization,'' and ``Indian-owned economic enterprise'' are defined in the clause of this contract entitled ``Indian Preference.'' (2) ``Indian reservation'' includes Indian reservations, public domain Indian Allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (3) ``On or near an Indian Reservation'' means on a reservation or reservations or within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) where a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to commute to and from in the course of a work day. (c) Nothing in the requirements of this clause shall be interpreted to preclude Indian Tribes from independently developing and enforcing their own Indian preference requirements. Such requirements must not conflict with any Federal statutory or regulatory requirement dealing with the award and administration of contracts. (d) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in each subcontract awarded at any tier under this contract and to notify the Contracting Officer of such subcontracts. (e) In the event of noncompliance with this clause, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract in whole or in part or may impose any other sanctions authorized by law or by other provisions of the contract.
