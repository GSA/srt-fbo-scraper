__________________________					_______________________________

JEFFREY A. HY							LISA GROSS

AMP Program Manager						Contracting Officer

USTCAQ-M								USTCAQ-D
 

1.  INTRODUCTION



1.1.  This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to set forth the procedures and guidelines to be used by the Government to ensure that the contractor achieves the required performance standards as specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The PWS contains a Service Delivery Summary (SDS) that summarizes performance objectives (service required) and performance thresholds (specific standard) contained within the body of the PWS.  The SDS does not identify every service required, but only those services considered most important for mission accomplishment.  This QASP is based on the premise that the contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  The SDS recognizes that the contractor is not a perfect manager and that unforeseen and uncontrollable problems do occur.  Good management and use of an adequate quality control plan will allow the contractor to meet or exceed the performance standards specified in the PWS.



2.  PURPOSE



This QASP is to

 

Provide a systematic method to survey and evaluate contractor services to determine conformity with the technical requirements of the contract. 

Define the roles and responsibilities of participating Government officials.

Describe the evaluation methods that will be employed by the Government in assessing the contractor’s performance.

Describe the process of performance documentation.

Provide copies of the Quality Assurance (QA) monitoring forms that will be used by the Government in documenting and evaluating contractor’s performance.



3.  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES



The Government monitors contractor performance on a continuing basis through the services of a surveillance team.  The surveillance team consists of the following members:  Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR). 



3.1. Contracting Officer (CO):  The CO has overall responsibility for contract administration.  The CO is responsible for monitoring contract compliance and resolving any and all disagreements regarding interpretation of contract terms and conditions.  The two primary functions of the CO with regard to the surveillance activity are to approve payments and authorize changes to the contract.  Payment is authorized based on documented objective evidence provided by the COR that contractor performance meets the performance standards specified.  The CO is the only Government official authorized to revise the contract.  Additionally, the CO is responsible for approving the QASP. 



3.2. Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR):  The COR serves as a functional expert and is responsible for monitoring, assessing, recording and reporting the technical performance of the contractor on a continuous basis.  The COR schedules surveillance activities, evaluates and documents performance by the contractor, initiates requests for and evaluates adequacy of the corrective action, and reports contractor performance of contractor requirements.  CORs are sufficiently trained to perform the required duties and to ensure their knowledge of the terms and conditions of the contract. 



3.2.1.  The COR is to be objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating contractor performance against standards. 



3.2.2.  The COR will notify the CO immediately when an evaluation shows that performance does not meet the standards identified in this QASP. 



3.2.3.  The COR is required to ensure changes in work are not initiated before a written authorization or modification is issued by the CO. 

 

3.2.4.  The COR is required to accept delivery of services.  The COR must ensure that all services on Firm Fixed Price CLINs have been performed before entering the quantity received and digitally signing the receiving report/invoice in Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF).  The COR has a maximum of seven (7) days after the contractor’s submission of a properly documented receiving report/invoice to accept the quantity and digitally sign the document in WAWF.  Prompt processing of receiving reports/invoices in WAWF increases the Government’s ability to take discounts offered and decreases the likelihood of the Government incurring interest expense for late payment.  After digital signature, the signed receiving report/invoice will be routed to Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) for scheduling of payment.  For Labor Hour CLINs, the COR must review, on a monthly basis, the cost vouchers submitted and ensure the dollars expended are commensurate with the progress being made on the contract. 



3.2.5.  The COR is required to provide an assessment of contractor performance to the CO for input into CPARS.



4. METHODS OF SURVEILLANCE



4.1. Service Delivery Summary (SDS):  The SDS summarizes the expected service objectives (outcomes) and identifies the metrics that will be tracked to determine whether the outcomes are being achieved at the appropriate levels of performance.  The Government, through the COR, will monitor contractor performance using the surveillance method(s) described below.  In determining the evaluation criteria, the Government has considered what the contract specifically calls for, how performance can be surveyed, and if the proposed method of surveillance is adequate to assure the required level of performance has been achieved.  Additionally, contractor performance will be a factor affecting application of the plan; i.e., surveillance frequency may be increased or decreased based on contractor demonstrated and documented performance.  One or a combination of the following surveillance methods will be used to produce a well-rounded indication of contractor conformance:  Sampling (spot, periodic, random), third party audit, inspection/review (verification of specific tasks, weekly, monthly, quarterly, biannually, and annually), and customer/government input.



4.1.1. Sampling:  This is the most appropriate method for frequently recurring tasks.  Random sampling is done to determine whether to accept or reject the contractor’s performance of the total lot of a particular task for a given period of time, using the premise that the statistically selected sample is representative of the entire lot.  Sampling may be spot, periodic, or random.



4.1.2. Third Party Audits:  Conducted by an authorized agent of the Government, federal, state, and local agencies (i.e., OSHA, DMV, EPA, Environmental Management, etc.).



4.1.3. Inspection/Review 



This surveillance type is preferred for those tasks that occur infrequently.  It is also used frequently for those tasks having very stringent performance requirements.  When this type of surveillance is used, the COR must inspect and evaluate the contractor’s performance each time it is performed to determine acceptability.



This type of surveillance consists of the evaluation of samples selected on other than a 100 percent or statistically random basis.  The results of periodic surveillance inspections may be used as the basis for actions against the contractor.  In such cases, the Inspection of Services clause becomes the basis for the CO’s actions.  This will be done more frequently at the beginning of the contract, and is expected to decrease as standards are consistently met, but may increase if performance falls below standard.



4.1.4. Customer Inputs



The COR may use customer input to document discrepancies in contractor performance.  The CO may use validated customer complaints as the basis for actions against the contractor.  In such cases, the appropriate contract clause addressing inspection of contractor performance becomes the basis for the CO’s actions.  Under the philosophy of performance-based service contracting, we expect the customer to file complaints directly with the contractor with an automatic copy going to the COR.  This allows COR oversight of the contractor’s progress in answering complaints, resolving problems and updating the Quality Control (QC) program, while the contractor is responsible to the customer.  When used, customer complaints must follow a formalized procedure.



The COR is the primary point of contact for and must receive copies of all customer complaints.  AF Form 714, Customer Complaint Record, or a locally devised form may be used, but all complaints and any resulting resolution must be documented with the information required on AF Form 714.  Customer complaint forms become a permanent part of the COR surveillance records.



The COR will check customer complaints to ensure resolution of the deficiency and revision of the QC program to prevent recurrence.



4.1.5.  Management Review:  Methods of surveillance can change after contract award based on acceptance of a contractor’s proposed QC program or agreement that establishes the metrics to be used.  When metrics are used as a method of surveillance through the partnering process, they may be developed after contract award, but prior to the performance start date.



4.1.6.  Non-SDS Items:  For required tasks not shown on the SDS, including all other tasks in the PWS and any referenced documents, the Government still retains the right to inspect any item included in the contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 46 Inspection of Services clause.  Inspection of these services will be performed in the same general manner as periodic surveillance items mentioned above.  The results of these inspections are documented and, if necessary, are provided to the CO for action.  Should a discrepancy be observed, the CO will handle each documented discrepancy on a case-by-case basis.



5.  EVALUATION METHODOLOGY



This QASP comprehensively guides the surveillance team's activities and has been developed in a format to ensure ease of understanding and implementation.  For each performance objective in the SDS, the specific method(s) of surveillance, performance thresholds (standards), sampling procedures, inspection procedures, and detailed objective task descriptors are shown in the QASP Summary in Attachment 1.  The methodology described in the chart shall be used as the basis for performing surveillance of the respective performance objectives.



5.1. Established Procedures.



Each contractor assessment shall follow an established procedure for surveillance, recording, reporting, and follow-up, outlined as follows:



The frequency of surveillance will be in accordance with the COR Schedule.



Surveillance will be performed in accordance with Attachment 1 and results/comments recorded.



Performance/non-performance for a particular task will be entered chronologically by the COR on a historical log of surveyed performance.  If no deficiency exists in contractor performance for this element, no further action is required.



If contractor performance is deficient, the course of action is dependent on the severity/impact/ frequency of the non-performance.  Re-performance is the first action to resolve deficiencies.  When the COR determines a deficiency is not Government caused, an AF Form 802, Contract Discrepancy Report, or a locally devised form, is initiated.  The COR completes blocks 1 through 6 of the form and sends it to the CO.  The CO must evaluate the Contract Discrepancy Report and, if appropriate, sign and send it to the contractor.  The contractor must complete blocks 9 and 10 according to the requirements of the contract and return it to the CO within 5 calendar days of receipt.  Upon receipt of the contractor’s response, the CO, in consultation with the COR, must evaluate the contractor’s response and take the appropriate action.  The CO must document the evaluation (in block 11) and action taken (in block 12) on the Contract Discrepancy Report.  The COR shall submit a Discrepancy Status Report (see attachment 2) and attach a copy of all Contract Discrepancy Reports for the reporting period.



When corrective action is reported by the contractor, the COR will follow up with additional surveillance to verify implementation.



5.2.  Conversation record:  Conversation Record, (DOD) Optional Form 271, may be used throughout this process to effectively document program issues and concerns addressed with the contractor and Government points of contact.  This provides a method to keep QA personnel informed of the status of issues and concerns.



6.  DOCUMENTATION



All surveillance activities must be documented to provide the required audit trail to justify Government acceptance and payment.  The documented audit trail of the surveillance (DAS) activities is required by FAR 46.104(c), Contract Administration Office Responsibilities, which states, “Maintain, as part of the performance records of the contract, suitable records reflecting, (1) the nature of Government contract quality assurance actions including, when appropriate, the number of observations made and the number and type of defects; and (2) decisions regarding the acceptability of the products, the processes, and the requirements, as well as action to correct defects.”



All documentation resulting from surveillance is made a permanent part of the contract file.  The COR must keep the documentation files during the term of the contract and either monthly or at the conclusion of the contract (as directed by the CO) transfer the files to the CO for inclusion in the official contract file.  It is the responsibility of the COR to establish and maintain this information in a DAS Folder.  The surveillance folder(s) should include as a minimum:



a.  Contract, including modifications

b.  Task Orders, including modifications

c.  Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

d.  COR Letter of Designation

e.  Invoices

f.  Surveillance Records

g.  Written report of all inspections and timelines of deliverables

h.  Written report of any deficiency

i.  Any other written documentation relation to contract performance

j.  General Correspondence

Major releases also include new functionality, and also may contain fixes to software problem reports. Releases are classified as "minor" if they include new functionality, but no changes to the system architecture or security posture. Minor releases also may contain fixes to software problem reports. Maintenance releases contain only fixes to software problem reports. Emergency releases normally contain only fixes to software problem reports, but may include new capability rushed to the field to support a high-priority requirement. For each major, minor, or maintenance release, the contractor shall prepare a Software Test Description (STD) that describes the developer's test methodology and traces requirements from contractual and/or requirements documentation through to test cases. The STD shall conform to the requirements of CDRL A002 (DI-IPSC-81439A/T (tailored), Software Test Description.) The contractor shall create test cases for each requirement that shall provide detailed test instructions, any pre-conditions or inputs, and expected results for each required functional capability or defect. This STD also shall describe the contractor's approach to conduct regression testing on changes made to commercial off-the-shelf components and application software components. In addition, the contractor shall provide documentation that records the status and results of the contractor's test efforts. The STD, test cases, and test reports shall be delivered in accordance with the deliverable table in Paragraph 1.4. The contractor shall conduct a Test Readiness Review (TRR) before contractor systems integration testing commences and an Operational Readiness Review (ORR) before UAT commences. The goals of these reviews are to confirm the readiness of the application and test infrastructure (e.g., test environment and documentation) to start each test event, to identify the proper exit criteria necessary to complete each test event, and obtain Government approval to proceed toward the next milestone leading ultimately to software fielding. The contractor shall prepare briefing slides for each TRR and ORR and provide them for Government review before either TRR or ORR occurs. Timing of delivery of the TRR and ORR slides for Government review is as noted in the Deliverable Table in Paragraph 1.4. The contractor shall deliver a Software Test Report (STR) that details test results following completion of GWT and SIT. The contractor shall submit one report that consolidates results of both test events. This report shall conform to the requirements of CDRL A003 (DI-IPSC-81440A/T STR, Software Test Report). 1.3.4.2.2 The TRR shall at a minimum, address the following topics, issues, and events: (a) (b) Test methodology to verify contents of the release Software Problem Reports (SPR) contained in the release

4

(c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h)

Review of all formal test documentation (requirements traceability matrix (RTM), test cases, test plans) Verification of the availability of all necessary personnel, forms, equipment, software, and support material, and/or data for the test to be performed Review that all new requirements are mapped to test cases Confirm that each SPR has a test case developed against it, or provision of reason why one has not been developed Verification that test procedures have been reviewed and recommendations incorporated into the appropriate documentation Results of regression testing

1.3.4.2.3. To support the ORR, the developer shall produce the test artifacts along with a description of any open Software Test Report/Software Problem Report (STR/SPR) for review by the PMO and functional representatives. The successful outcome of this review should result in Government PM approval to proceed to UAT. The developer shall deliver all artifacts to the PMO and place them under CM control including a draft Software Version Description (SVD). 1.3.4.2.4. Once the software is delivered to the Government for UAT, the contractor shall not implement changes to the software baseline under test until the Government has completed (or postponed) testing, prioritized software or test problem reports, and has accepted the change(s) proposed to resolve the problem(s). The contractor shall identify and track deficiencies discovered during UAT, but shall not issue a new version of software for continuation of UAT without PM approval. In accordance with PM and FM prioritization and PM direction, the contractor shall resolve these deficiencies and present another software version for either GWT or UAT. After completion of UAT, the Government will conduct a Production Readiness Review (PRR), with developer participation, that demonstrates readiness of the application and infrastructure to support fielding to the production environment, and to issue a fielding decision. 1.3.4.2.5. If the contractor uses automated test scripts to verify software problem fixes for a software version entering a scheduled test event involving Government participation, the contractor shall provide a user-readable version of the automated test script(s) and expected test result(s) for each test case; these shall be included in the Software Test Cases deliverable. The contractor shall provide the results of automated testing of the software build to be used at the start of scheduled test events, and any builds occurring during scheduled test events. The contractor shall include these automated test result(s) as an addendum to the STR. 1.3.4.2.6. The contractor shall meet all government specifications for each requirement at each release. The PM will make the final decision concerning software acceptance. Deficiencies will be documented, prioritized, tracked, and may result in non-acceptance of the software release by the Government. The software shall be resubmitted for testing and only accepted by the Government once it passes government testing. In this contract, deficiencies are defined as the difference between the functional specifications stated by the Government and the capability provided in the software being delivered to the Government. This definition includes capability previously delivered to the Government that was not a part of the new functional specifications or code changed due to fixing problems with the software that the Government Configuration Control Board (CCB) authorized. 1.3.4.3 Task Area 4 Subtask 4 ­ AMP Software Releases. The contractor shall provide up to two (2) minor releases, up to three (3) scheduled maintenance releases, and up to six (6) emergency releases annually; emergency releases will occur between regularly scheduled releases. The following pertains: Each release must undergo Information Assurance (IA) review to determine the degree to which the changes incorporated into the software impact the security or hardware architectures of the system, or include the implementation of a new operating system, database, or interface. This review is accomplished by submitting update requests through the Cyberspace Infrastructure Planning System (CIPS). The contractor shall assist the Government in achieving software acceptance through the USTRANSCOM security CIPS process by accomplishing tasks described in Paragraph 1.3.7. Successful completion of this process will result when the USTRANSCOM Information Assurance Manager grants his/her approval of the updated product version within CIPS.

4.7 ­ 4.11 All provisions and modifications of the ID/IQ Contract apply. 5.0 SECURITY (PHYSICAL, PERSONNEL, INFORMATION, ANTITERRORISM / FORCE PROTECTION AND INDUSTRIAL SECURITY) 5.1 General Security Information The overall classification of work associated with this PWS will be at the SECRET level. Each task order will contain a DD 254 that will outline the security requirements for classified access to perform the deliverables and task orders in support of these contracts. All contract work associated with this PWS and all task orders deal directly with supporting current operations and decision making for the Distribution Process Owner (DPO) for the DOD. An overall completed / signed DD 254 is attached to this PWS. Safeguarding of classified material at contractor locations is at the SECRET level. The safeguarding level must be approved in writing by DSS before any classified will be stored at the contractor facility. All background investigation levels, access to classified areas and materials, assigned IT/Automated Data Processing (ADP) levels required by the Contractor and security stipulations for this classified contract (including any task orders assigned in the future) will be approved by one of the following: CO, COR or the functional manager, before the start of the contract or any task orders under this contract. The Contractor will not divulge any financial, planning, programming, or budgeting information without the express consent of the Government as outlined in OPSEC and Information Security regulations or be held liable for punitive damages incurred as a result of release of such information. The Contractor shall comply with all appropriate provisions of the applicable security regulations while assigned to this contract for DOD and USTRANSCOM. 25

5.2 Personnel Security Requirements Personnel performing services under this contract, to include sub-contractors and/or partners, shall be citizens of the United States of America. Dual citizens will not be authorized interim or final security clearance determinations within DOD. Any U.S. citizens who currently have (either expired or active) foreign passports will not be able to obtain or hold an interim/final security clearance determination within DOD; they are considered dual citizens. All Contractor personnel shall possess the appropriate personnel security investigation for the position(s) occupied as directed in section 5.1; these levels will be stipulated by the CO/COR or functional manager of the contract. The following guidance will be followed when determining position sensitivity levels and background investigation levels for this contract depending on requirements and Task Orders: POSITION LEVEL: Information Technology (IT)-II, Automated Data Processing (ADP)-II, or Non-Critical Sensitive Positions (SECRET) IT/ADP-II and Non-Critical Sensitive Positions are those positions that have: access to SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL information; Security police/provost marshal-type duties involving the enforcement of law and security duties involving the protection and safeguarding of DOD personnel and property; Category II-IT/ADP-II positions; duties involving education and orientation of DOD personnel; duties involving the design, operation, or maintenance of intrusion detection systems deployed to safeguard DOD personnel and property; any other position so designated by the head of the Component or designee. BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS: (IT-II/ADP-II/Non-Critical Sensitive) Background Investigation Requirement for SECRET: Positions designated by the Government at the Non-Critical Sensitive/ADP-II/IT-II rating require a National Agency Check with Local Credit (NACLC) (or acceptable periodic reinvestigation) favorably adjudicated (a favorable adjudication grants eligibility at the SECRET level as prescribed by DOD 5200.2-R). The IT-II/ADP-II requirement mandates the Contractor have a minimum Facility Clearance Level (FCL) at the SECRET (or higher) level due to investigation submissions as directed in DOD 5220.22-M, DOD 5200.1-R and the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). POSITION LEVEL: Information Technology (IT)-III Automated Data Processing (ADP)-III Non-Sensitive Positions (POSITION OF TRUST DETERMINATION) (NO CLASSIFIED ACCESS): All other positions involved in computer activities and CAC. No clearance is granted for classified access and only a Position of Trust (PoT) is awarded and posted in the JPAS. BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS: (IT-III/ADP-III/Non-Sensitive) Background Investigation Requirements for POSITION OF TRUST Determinations (NO CLASSIFIED ACCESS): Positions designated by the Government at the Non-Sensitive/ADP-III/IT-III rating require a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) (or acceptable investigation/reinvestigation) favorably adjudicated (a favorable adjudication issues a Position of Trust determination as prescribed by DOD 5200.2-R and DOD DTM 08-003. Favorable NACI or equivalent investigation results must be posted in JPAS before a CAC or NIPRNET access will be granted. To obtain interim CAC/NIPRNET access, NACI investigations will be opened with fingerprint, name and criminal records checks returned favorably before the credentials (CAC and NIPRNET) are issued. NACI submissions will be completed on the Standard Form (SF) 85P and submitted with fingerprint cards (FP 258) to USTRANSCOM Security Service Center (SSC) for processing. No classified access will be granted based on the NACI investigation.

26

NOTE: The above requirements for IT-III/ADP-III/Non-Sensitive Positions cover access to unclassified systems only. Contractors who require access to classified systems or areas must have interim or final adjudication of background investigations at the Non-Critical Sensitive and Critical Sensitive levels. USTRANSCOM only processes NACI/PoT investigations and does not complete any personnel security investigations for classified access. It is incumbent upon the Contractor to have the appropriate investigations completed upon start of the contract. Personnel who do not have the proper investigation will be denied access to USTRANSCOM facilities until investigations have been favorably adjudicated. 5.3 Facilities Clearance Level The Contractor must have a valid FCL at the SECRET level (or higher). Interim FCLs are acceptable provided they are not expired. FCL procedures and security guidelines for adjudicative requirements are outlined in DOD 5220.22-M. FCLs and Interim FCLs must be awarded by the DSS.

The Government will provide unrestricted access to facilities, consistent with security clearance and need to know, necessary for the onsite personnel to perform their work IAW the contract or task order. Contractor personnel assigned on-site at USTRANSCOM shall display the Restricted Area badge at all times while in Government facilities. Visits to SAFB by contractor personnel who do not possess the CAC will be facilitated by the COR/CO sponsoring the employee through the online base access system. 5.7 Visits to USTRANSCOM Buildings The following visit procedures apply; note that different a JPAS Security Management Office (SMO) code will be used depending upon the type of visit.  General Visits: Any visit(s) by contractor personnel not permanently assigned to this contract (i.e., company presidents, company security managers, contractor personnel not permanently assigned at SAFB, etc.) require an electronic visit request be submitted using JPAS. JPAS visits can be forwarded to the SMO code: USTC-SDDC. The visit request will annotate the contract number in the POC block of the visit request and the name/phone number of either the CO or COR in the phone number block.

6.1 Periodic Government Inspections. The contractor shall authorize Government inspections and reviews to ensure compliance with DOD IA requirements throughout the contract performance period. The contractor will be responsible for taking corrective action based upon the impact and severity of identified weaknesses. 6.2 Detect, Analyze, Respond. 1 The contractor shall report to the USTRANSCOM Technical Information Analysis Center (TIAC) and USTRANSCOM designated Government personnel within 4 hours of discovery of any suspected cyber intrusion event that affects DOD information resident on or transiting the contractor's unclassified information systems. Initial report shall be provided even if some details are not yet available, with follow-on detailed reporting within 24 hours. Reportable cyber intrusion events include the following: (a) A cyber intrusion event appearing to be an advanced persistent threat (b) A cyber intrusion event involving data exfiltration or manipulation or other loss of DOD information resident on or transiting the contractor's, or its sub-contractors', unclassified information systems (c) Intrusion activities that allow unauthorized access to an unclassified information system on which DOD information is resident or transiting Note: Definition of advanced persistent threat: An extremely proficient, patient, determined, and capable adversary including two or more of such adversaries working together. 2 The incident report shall include, at a minimum, the following information: (a) Applicable dates (date of suspected compromise and date of discovery) (b) Threat methodology (all known resources used such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, domain names, and malware) (c) An account of what actions the threat(s) may have taken on the victim system/network and what information may have been accessed (d) A description of the roles and functions of the threat-accessed system (e) An initial list of potentially impacted Government programs and each program's classification (f) What information may have been exfiltrated that may impact Government programs (g) A list of all employees and subcontracted employees who work or have worked with the victim system/network (h) A point of contact to coordinate damage assessment activities 3 Incident Report Submission. The contractor will submit unclassified network cyber incident reports to the USTRANSCOM TIAC and USTRANSCOM designated Government personnel via encrypted email or another mutually agreed upon secure communications method. Copies of malware require special handling and precoordination must be accomplished prior to submission. 4 Incident Response Coordination. In the event of a known or potential intrusion, the contractor agrees to allow follow-on actions by the Government to further characterize and evaluate the suspect activity. The contractor acknowledges that damage assessments may be necessary to ascertain intruder methodology and identify systems compromised as a result of the intrusion. The contractor acknowledges that in certain cases a complete forensic analysis may be necessary to ascertain intruder methodology and identify systems compromised as a result of the intrusion. Once an intrusion is identified, the contractor agrees to take all reasonable and appropriate steps to preserve any and all evidence, information, data, logs, electronic files and similar type information reference NIST Special Publication 800-61: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, (current version) related to the intrusion for subsequent forensic analysis so that an accurate and complete damage assessment can be accomplished by the Government. The contractor is not required to maintain an organic forensic capability, but must ensure data is preserved until forensic analysis can be performed by the Government (e.g., removing an affected system, while still powered on, from the network meets the intent of this requirement). Follow-on actions will be coordinated with the contractor via the COR. 6.3 Law Enforcement/Counterintelligence. In the event of a known or potential intrusion, the contractor shall consent to responding counterintelligence or law enforcement investigative agency requests to apply forensic analysis tools to contractor information systems affected by the intrusion, including monitoring tools, imaging tools, and other techniques that the agency seeks to apply to effectively analyze the intrusion. The contractor shall allow the responding counterintelligence or law enforcement investigative agency to image affected systems, including

29

systems containing proprietary information. Nothing in this contract shall limit the ability to conduct law enforcement or counterintelligence activities, or other activities in the interest of national security. 6.4 Information Sharing. The Government may use and disclose reported information that does not include attribution information (e.g., information regarding threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, or best practices) at its discretion to assist entities in protecting information or information systems (e.g., threat information products, threat assessment reports); provided that such use or disclosure is otherwise authorized in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, and policies. 6.5 Confidentiality and Non-Attribution Statement. The Government will take reasonable steps, by controlled access and need-to-know procedures, to protect against public release of attribution information of the contractor. The Government may use and disclose reported information that includes attribution information only on a need-toknow basis to authorized persons for cyber security and related purposes (e.g., in support of forensic analysis, incident response, compromise or damage assessments, law enforcement, counter intelligence, threat reporting, and trend analysis). The Government may disclose attribution information to support contractors that are supporting the Government's cyber security and related activities if these support contractors are subject to legal confidentiality requirements that prevent any further use or disclose of the attribution information. The Government agrees to consider available exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act to protect against disclosure of attribution information of the contractor to unauthorized persons. Within a reasonable period necessary to perform an analysis after completion of the assessment, all contractor proprietary information or third party proprietary information in the possession of the Government as a result of the assessment will be destroyed unless other disposition is agreed upon in writing by the Parties or is required by law, Executive Order or regulation. 6.6 Malicious Code Warranty. The Contractor represents and warrants that the software shall be free from all computer viruses, worms, time-outs, time bombs, back doors, disabling devices and other harmful or malicious code intended to or which may damage, disrupt, inconvenience or permit access to the software user's or another's software, hardware, networks, data or information.

                                                    SUBCONTRACTING PLAN INSTRUCTIONS/TEMPLATE


Notice to Other Than Small Business Vendors:  The USTRANSCOM Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) provides this template as a model to
follow for subcontract plan submission and acceptance.   You must complete this template in the order provided addressing each specific
objective indicating efforts to maximize small business opportunity and participation.   The plan is NOT a fill-in-the-blank form and you must
remove instructional language.  The template identifies eleven specific elements contractors must address within their subcontract plan and does
not establish minimum requirements for an acceptable plan.  In addition, offerors should thoroughly review the requirements set forth in FAR
19.7 and FAR clause 52-219-9 as well as DFARS 219.7 and DFARS clause 252.219-7003 regarding “The Small Business Subcontracting Program” and
“Small Business Subcontracting Plan” before plan submission.

Subcontracting Plan Types:

Commercial Plan-  A subcontracting plan (including goals) that covers the offeror’s fiscal year and that applies to the entire production of
commercial items sold by either the entire company or a portion thereof (e.g., division, plant, or product line.)  Note that this type of plan
shall relate to the offeror’s planned subcontracting generally, for both commercial and government business, rather than solely to an individual
government contract.  Per FAR 19.704(d) and clause 52.219-9(g), a commercial plan is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors
furnishing commercial items.  Once a contractor’s commercial plan has been approved, the Government shall not require another subcontracting
plan from the same contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the contractor continues to
meet the definition of a commercial item.  The contractor shall—  (1) Submit the commercial plan to either the first contracting officer
awarding a contract subject to the plan during the contractor’s fiscal year, or, if the contractor has ongoing contracts with commercial plans,
to the contracting officer responsible for the contract with the latest completion date.  The contracting officer shall negotiate the commercial
plan for the Government.  The approved commercial plan shall remain in effect during the contractor’s fiscal year for all Government contracts
in effect during that period; (2) Submit a new commercial plan, 30 working days before the end of the Contractor’s fiscal year, to the
contracting officer responsible for the uncompleted Government contract with the latest completion date. The contractor must provide to each
contracting officer responsible for an ongoing contract subject to the plan, the identity of the contracting officer that will be negotiating
the new plan; (3) When the new commercial plan is approved, provide a copy of the approved plan to each contracting officer responsible for an
ongoing contract that is subject to the plan; and (4) Comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (a)(10) of FAR 19.704 by
submitting one SSR in eSRS for all contracts covered by its commercial plan.  An ISR is not required for vendors with commercial plans.  The SSR
report will be acknowledged or rejected in eSRS by the contracting officer who approved the plan.  A SSR report shall be submitted semi-annually
for the six months ending March 31 and the twelve months ending September 30.

Individual Plan:  Covers the ENTIRE contract period, applies to a specific contract, and has goals that are based on the offeror’s planned
subcontracting (and purchasing) in support of the specific contract, except that indirect costs incurred for common or joint purposes may be
allocated on a prorated basis to the contract.  For contracts with option periods, the plan will include SEPARATE goals and estimated value (or
sales) for the base period with SEPARATE goals and estimated value for each option period.  Per FAR 52.219-9(c) this type of plan must
separately address subcontracting with small business (SB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), service-disabled veteran-owned small
business(SDVOSB), HUBZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged business (SDB) (including ANCs and Indian Tribes), and women-owned small
business concerns (WOSB), with a separate part for the basic contract and separate parts for each option (if any).  The plan shall be included
in and made a part of the resultant contract.  The subcontracting plan shall be negotiated within the time specified by the Contracting Officer.
 Failure to submit and negotiate the subcontracting plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.  The Contractor shall submit
the Individual Subcontract Report (ISR), and the Summary Subcontract Report (SSR) using the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS)
(http://www.esrs.gov), following the instructions in the eSRS.

Subcontracting Dollars & Goals clarifications:

Total estimated subcontracting dollars (or spend) planned to all types of business concerns must be provided, then separately state the dollars
that will be subcontracted to each category.  All percents for each category will be expressed as a percentage of the total subcontracting
dollars to all concerns (both large and small business)*.
The Small business dollar amount must include all sub-group category amounts; i.e., HUBZone, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB (plus any "other small"
businesses that do not fall within one of these specified subgroups).  Alaskan Native Corporations (ANCs) and Indian tribes will be included in
the SDB amounts.


            Sample Dollars                 GSA Goal (FY 09)
      Total dollars to be subcontracted      $1,000,000                   100%
          (to both Large and Small Businesses)
      Large Businesses      $  630,000*                  *63%
      Small Businesses      $  370,000*                  *37%
       (includes HUBZone Small, Small Disadvantaged,
      Women-Owned Small, Veteran-Owned Small, Service-Disabled
      Veteran-Owned Small, and Other Small Business Concerns)

      HUBZone Small Businesses         $    30,000                3%
      Small Disadvantaged Businesses         $    60,000                6%
      Women-Owned Small Businesses           $    50,000                5%
      Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (Includes SDVOSB)        $    50,000                5%
      Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses         $    30,000                3%

*The total for large business and small business should equal the totals in both dollars and percents.  For small business dollars, do not add
subgroups together to reach the total Small figure, as the same dollars can be double and triple counted for each group as applicable to the
company receiving the order.

NOTE:  The total $370,000 to all Small businesses includes dollars within each subgroup (HUBZone, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, and SDVOSB), plus any other
small business concerns that are considered small and do not fall into a specified category.

assistance, counseling, or publicizing subcontracting opportunities) in this clause.

[Company Name] identifies potential subcontractors using the following source lists and organizations:

   E.  Indirect Costs Inclusion:

FAR 19.704(a)(6) and clause 52.219-9(d)(6) require a statement as to whether or not the offeror included indirect costs in establishing
subcontracting goals, and a description of the method used to determine the proportionate share of indirect costs to be incurred with SB
(including ANCs and Indian tribes), VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone, SDB (including ANCs and Indian tribes), and WOSB concerns.  NOTE: indirect costs
represent the expenses of doing business that are NOT easily identified with a specific project (i.e. contract or grant) but are generally
recognized as ordinary and necessary for the general operation of the contractor’s organization and the conduct of activities it performs.
Types of indirect costs include overhead (e.g. facility/utility & supplies cost), general and administrative (G&A), and fringe benefits (e.g.
services or benefits provided to employees such as health insurance, payroll taxes, pension contribution, etc).

Indirect costs _____HAVE BEEN (or) _____HAVE NOT BEEN included in the dollar and percentage subcontracting goals stated above.

If indirect costs HAVE been included, the method used to determine the proportionate share of indirect costs to be incurred with small business
concerns was as follows:

10.  Ensure that subcontract procurement “packages” are designed to permit the maximum possible participation of SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone, SDB
and WOSB concerns

HUBZone, SDB and WOSB concerns.

13.  Oversee the establishment and maintenance of contract and subcontract award records.

14.  Attend or arrange for the attendance of company counselors at Business Opportunity Workshops, Minority Business Enterprise Seminars, Trade

                                                                       eSRS

Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System web-based reporting requirements found at FAR clause 52.219-9(l):

The Contractor shall submit ISRs and SSRs using the web-based eSRS at http://www.esrs.gov. Purchases from a corporation, company, or subdivision
that is an affiliate of the prime Contractor or subcontractor are not included in these reports. Subcontract award data reported by prime
Contractors and subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate next-tier subcontractors. Credit cannot be taken for awards
made to lower tier subcontractors, unless the Contractor or subcontractor has been designated to receive a small business or small disadvantaged
business credit from an ANC or Indian tribe.

(1) ISR.  This report is not required for commercial plans. The report is required for each contract containing an individual subcontract plan
and shall be submitted to the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) or Contracting Officer, if no ACO is assigned.

(i) The report shall be submitted semi-annually during contract performance for the periods ending March 31 and September 30. A report is also
required for each contract within 30 days of contract completion. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period, unless
otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. Reports are required when due, regardless of whether there has been any subcontracting activity
since the inception of the contract or the previous reporting period.

(ii) When a subcontracting plan contains separate goals for the basic contract and each option, as prescribed by FAR 19.704(c), the dollar goal
inserted on this report shall be the sum of the base period through the current option; for example, for a report submitted after the second
option is exercised, the dollar goal would be the sum of the goals for the basic contract, the first option, and the second option.

(iii) The authority to acknowledge receipt or reject the ISR resides—
      (A) In the case of the prime Contractor, with the Contracting Officer; and
      (B) In the case of a subcontract with a subcontracting plan, with the entity that awarded the subcontract.

(2) SSR.
(i) Reports submitted under INDIVIDUAL contract plans—
 (A) This report encompasses all subcontracting under prime contracts and subcontracts with the awarding agency, regardless of the dollar value
of the subcontracts.
(B) The report may be submitted on a corporate, company or subdivision (e.g. plant or division operating as a separate profit center) basis,
unless otherwise directed by the agency.
(C) If a prime Contractor and/or subcontractor is performing work for more than one executive agency, a separate report shall be submitted to
each executive agency covering only that agency’s contracts, provided at least one of that agency’s contracts is over $650,000 (over $1,500,000
for construction of a public facility) and contains a subcontracting plan. For DoD, a consolidated report shall be submitted for all contracts
awarded by military departments/agencies and/or subcontracts awarded by DoD prime Contractors. However, for construction and related maintenance
and repair, a separate report shall be submitted for each DoD component.
(D) For DoD (USTRANSCOM) and NASA, the report shall be submitted semi-annually for the six months ending March 31 and the twelve months ending
September 30. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period.
  (E) Subcontract awards that are related to work for more than one executive agency shall be appropriately allocated.
  (F) The authority to acknowledge or reject SSRs in eSRS, including SSRs submitted by subcontractors with subcontracting plans, resides with
the Government agency awarding the prime contracts.
(ii) Reports submitted under a COMMERCIAL plan—
  (A) The report shall include all subcontract awards under the commercial plan in effect during the Government’s fiscal year.
  (B) A SSR report shall be submitted semi-annually for the six months ending March 31 and the twelve months ending September 30.  Reports are
due 30 days after the close of each reporting period.
  (C) If a Contractor has a commercial plan and is performing work for more than one executive agency, the Contractor shall specify the
percentage of dollars attributable to each agency from which contracts for commercial items were received.
  (D) The authority to acknowledge or reject SSRs for commercial plans resides with the Contracting Officer who approved the commercial plan.

(iii) All reports submitted at the close of each fiscal year (both individual and commercial plans) shall include a Year-End Supplementary
Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses. The report shall include subcontract awards, in whole dollars, to small disadvantaged business
concerns by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsector. If the data are not available when the year-end SSR is
submitted, the prime Contractor and/or subcontractor shall submit the Year-End Supplementary Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses within 90
days of submitting the year-end SSR. For a commercial plan, the Contractor may obtain from each of its subcontractors a predominant NAICS
Industry Subsector and report all awards to that subcontractor under its predominant NAICS Industry Subsector.

Foreign Nationals are not allowed to access classified information, nor are they allowed to fill Automated Data Processing (ADP)-I positions as defined in regulation DOD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Regulation, Appendix 10. 4.11 Acquisition Streamlining IAW DFARS 252.211-7000, the contractor shall submit acquisition streamlining recommendations electronically. The Contracting Officer will provide more specific submission instructions upon award. 5.0 SECURITY (PHYSICAL, PERSONNEL, INFORMATION, ANTITERRORISM / FORCE PROTECTION AND INDUSTRIAL SECURITY) 5.1 General Security Information The overall classification of work associated with this PWS will be at the SECRET level. Each task order will contain a DD 254 that will outline the security requirements for classified access to perform the deliverables and task orders in support of these contracts. All contract work associated with this PWS and all task orders deal directly with supporting current operations and decision making for the Distribution Process Owner (DPO) for the DOD. An overall completed / signed DD 254 is attached to this PWS. Safeguarding of classified material at contractor locations is at the SECRET level. The safeguarding level must be approved in writing by DSS before any classified will be stored at the contractor facility. All background investigation levels, access to classified areas and materials, assigned IT/ ADP levels required by the Contractor and security stipulations for this classified contract (including any task orders assigned in the future) will be approved by one of the following: CO, COR or the functional manager, before the start of the contract or any task orders under this contract. The Contractor will not divulge any financial, planning, programming, or budgeting information without the express consent of the Government as outlined in OPSEC and Information Security regulations or be held liable for punitive damages incurred as a result of release of such information. The Contractor shall comply with all appropriate provisions of the applicable security regulations while assigned to this contract for DOD and USTRANSCOM. 5.2 Personnel Security Requirements Personnel performing services under this contract, to include sub-contractors and/or partners, shall be citizens of the United States of America. Dual citizens will not be authorized interim or final security clearance determinations within DOD. Any U.S. citizens who currently have (either expired or active) foreign passports will not be able to obtain or hold an interim/final security clearance determination within DOD; they are considered dual citizens. All Contractor personnel shall possess the appropriate personnel security investigation for the position(s) occupied as directed in section 5.1; these levels will be stipulated by the CO/COR or functional manager of the contract. The following guidance will be followed when determining position sensitivity levels and background investigation levels for this contract depending on requirements and Task Orders: POSITION LEVEL: Information Technology (IT)-II, Automated Data Processing (ADP)-II, or Non-Critical Sensitive Positions (SECRET) IT/ADP-II and Non-Critical Sensitive Positions are those positions that have: access to SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL information; Security police/provost marshal-type duties involving the enforcement of law and security duties involving the protection and safeguarding of DOD personnel and property; Category II-IT/ADP-II positions; duties involving education and orientation of DOD personnel; duties involving the design, operation, or

HTC711-13-R-D008 Page 20 of 87 maintenance of intrusion detection systems deployed to safeguard DOD personnel and property; any other position so designated by the head of the Component or designee. BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS: (IT-II/ADP-II/Non-Critical Sensitive) Background Investigation Requirement for SECRET: Positions designated by the Government at the Non-Critical Sensitive/ADP-II/IT-II rating require a National Agency Check with Local Credit (NACLC) (or acceptable periodic reinvestigation) favorably adjudicated (a favorable adjudication grants eligibility at the SECRET level as prescribed by DOD 5200.2-R). The IT-II/ADP-II requirement mandates the Contractor have a minimum Facility Clearance Level (FCL) at the SECRET (or higher) level due to investigation submissions as directed in DOD 5220.22-M, DOD 5200.1-R and Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). POSITION LEVEL: Information Technology (IT)-III Automated Data Processing (ADP)-III Non-Sensitive Positions (POSITION OF TRUST DETERMINATION) (NO CLASSIFIED ACCESS): All other positions involved in computer activities and Common Access Card (CAC). No clearance is granted for classified access and only a Position of Trust (PoT) is awarded and posted in the JPAS. BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS: (IT-III/ADP-III/Non-Sensitive) Background Investigation Requirements for POSITION OF TRUST Determinations (NO CLASSIFIED ACCESS): Positions designated by the Government at the Non-Sensitive/ADP-III/IT-III rating require a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) (or acceptable investigation/reinvestigation) favorably adjudicated (a favorable adjudication issues a Position of Trust determination as prescribed by DOD 5200.2-R and DOD DTM 08-003. Favorable NACI or equivalent investigation results must be posted in JPAS before a CAC or NIPRNET access will be granted. To obtain interim CAC/NIPRNET access, NACI investigations will be opened with fingerprint, name and criminal records checks returned favorably before the credentials (CAC and NIPRNET) are issued. NACI submissions will be completed on the Standard Form (SF) 85P and submitted with fingerprint cards (FP 258) to USTRANSCOM Security Service Center (SSC) for processing. No classified access will be granted based on the NACI investigation. NOTE: The above requirements for IT-III/ADP-III/Non-Sensitive Positions cover access to unclassified systems only. Contractors who require access to classified systems or areas must have interim or final adjudication of background investigations at the Non-Critical Sensitive and Critical Sensitive levels. USTRANSCOM only processes NACI/PoT investigations and does not complete any personnel security investigations for classified access. It is incumbent upon the Contractor to have the appropriate investigations completed upon start of the contract. Personnel who do not have the proper investigation will be denied access to USTRANSCOM facilities until investigations have been favorably adjudicated. 5.3 Facilities Clearance Level The Contractor must have a valid FCL at the SECRET level (or higher). Interim FCLs are acceptable provided they are not expired. FCL procedures and security guidelines for adjudicative requirements are outlined in DOD 5220.22-M and DOD 5200.2-R. FCLs and Interim FCLs must be awarded by the DSS.

3 Incident Report Submission. The contractor will submit unclassified network cyber incident reports to the USTRANSCOM TIAC and USTRANSCOM designated Government personnel via encrypted email or another mutually agreed upon secure communications method. Copies of malware require special handling and precoordination must be accomplished prior to submission. 4 Incident Response Coordination. In the event of a known or potential intrusion, the contractor agrees to allow follow-on actions by the Government to further characterize and evaluate the suspect activity. The contractor acknowledges that damage assessments may be necessary to ascertain intruder methodology and identify systems compromised as a result of the intrusion. The contractor acknowledges that in certain cases a complete forensic analysis may be necessary to ascertain intruder methodology and identify systems compromised as a result of the intrusion. Once an intrusion is identified, the contractor agrees to take all reasonable and appropriate steps to preserve any and all evidence, information, data, logs, electronic files and similar type information reference NIST Special Publication 800-61: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide, (current version) related to the intrusion for subsequent forensic analysis so that an accurate and complete damage assessment can be accomplished by the Government. The contractor is not required to maintain an organic forensic capability, but must ensure data is preserved until forensic analysis can be performed by the Government (e.g., removing an affected system, while still powered on, from the network meets the intent of this requirement). Any follow-on actions shall be coordinated with the contractor via the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). 6.3 Law Enforcement/Counterintelligence. In the event of a known or potential intrusion, the contractor shall consent to responding counterintelligence or law enforcement investigative agency requests to apply forensic analysis tools to contractor information systems affected by the intrusion, including monitoring tools, imaging tools, and other techniques that the agency seeks to apply to effectively analyze the intrusion.

The Government will take reasonable steps, by controlled access and need-to-know procedures, to protect against public release of attribution information of the contractor. The Government may use and disclose reported information that includes attribution information only on a need-toknow basis to authorized persons for cyber security and related purposes (e.g., in support of forensic analysis, incident response, compromise or damage assessments, law enforcement, counter intelligence, threat reporting, and trend analysis). The Government may disclose attribution information to support contractors that are supporting the Government's cyber security and related activities if these support contractors are subject to legal confidentiality requirements that prevent any further use or disclosure of the attribution information. The Government agrees to consider available exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act to protect against disclosure of attribution information of the contractor to unauthorized persons. Within a reasonable period necessary to perform an analysis after completion of the assessment, all contractor proprietary information or third party proprietary information in the possession of the Government as a result of the assessment will be destroyed unless other disposition is agreed upon in writing by the Parties or is required by law, Executive Order or regulation. 6.6 Malicious Code Warranty. The Contractor represents and warrants that the software shall be free from all computer viruses, worms, time-outs, time bombs, back doors, disabling devices and other harmful or malicious code intended to or which may damage, disrupt, inconvenience or permit access to the software user's or another's software, hardware, networks, data or information.

HTC711-13-R-D008 Page 29 of 87 APPENDIX C NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT AND AGREEMENT TO DISCLOSE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FOR CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES ON USTRANSCOM CONTRACTS NOTE: This Agreement is a standard agreement designed for use by contractor (including sub-contractor) employees assigned to work on USTRANSCOM contracts. Its use is designed to protect non-public Government information from disclosure, identify potential conflicts of interest, and prevent violations of federal statutes/regulations. The restrictions contained in this agreement also serve contractors by promoting compliant behavior that keeps contractors eligible to compete for Government contracts. In addition to the potential impact on future business opportunities, failure to abide by this agreement could result in administrative, civil, or criminal penalties specified by statute or regulation. 1. I, , currently an employee of terms and conditions set forth below. , hereby agree to the

2. I understand that I may have access to confidential business information, contractor bid or proposal information (as defined by FAR 3.104-1), and/or source selection information (as defined by FAR 2.101) either for contract performance, as a result of working in a USTRANSCOM facility, or of working near USTRANSCOM personnel, contractors, visitors, etc. I fully understand that such information is sensitive and must be protected in accordance with 41 US Code Section 423 and FAR SubPart 3.1. 3. In the course of performing under contract/order # contract for USTRANSCOM, I agree to: or some other contract or sub-

a) Use only for Government purpose any and all confidential business information, contractor bid or proposal information, and/or source selection sensitive information to which I am given access. I agree not to disclose "non-public information" by any means (in whole or in part, alone or in combination with other information, directly, indirectly, or derivatively) to any person except to a US Government official with a need to know or to a non-Government person (including, but not limited to, a person in my company, affiliated companies, sub-contractors, etc.) who has a need to know related to the immediate contract/order, has executed a valid form of this non-disclosure agreement, and receives prior clearance by the Contracting Officer. All distribution of the documents will be controlled with the concurrence of the Contracting Officer. b) "Non-public information," as used herein includes trade secrets; confidential or proprietary business information (as defined for Government employees in 18 United States Code (USC) 1905); advance procurement information (future requirements, acquisition strategies, statements of work, budget/program/planning data, etc.); source selection information (proposal rankings, source selection plans, contractor bid or proposal information); information protected by the Privacy Act (social security numbers, home addresses, etc.); sensitive information protected from release under the Freedom of Information Act (predecisional deliberations, litigation materials, privileged material, etc.); and information that has not been released to the general public and has not been authorized for such release (as defined for Government employees in5 CFR 2635.703). c) Not use such information for any non-Governmental purposes, including, but not limited to, the preparation of bids or proposals, or the development or execution of other business or commercial ventures. d) Store the information in such a manner as to prevent inadvertent disclosure or releases to individuals who have not been authorized access to it. 4. I understand that I must never make an unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential business information, contractor bid or proposal information, and/or source selection sensitive information unless:

HTC711-13-R-D008 Page 30 of 87

a) The information has otherwise been made available without restriction to the Government, to a competing contractor or to the public. b) The Contracting Officer determines that such information is not subject to protection from release. 5. I agree that I shall not seek access to "non-public information" beyond what is required for the performance of the services I am contracted to perform. I agree that when I seek access to such information, attend meetings, or communicate with other parties about such information, I will identify myself as a contractor. Should I become aware of any improper or unintentional release or disclosure of "non-public information," I will immediately report it to the Contracting Officer in writing. I agree that I will return all forms (including copies or reproduction of original documents) of any "non-public information" provided to me by the Government for use in performing my duties to the control of the Government when my duties no longer require this information. 6.

HTC711-13-R-D008 Page 32 of 87

APPENDIX E PROJECTED NEW CAPABILITY Projected new capability may include, but are not limited to, the following. The new capability listed below is projected and may or may not be awarded. In addition, new capability listed below for particular option years may be awarded at the Government's discretion before or after the option year specified. Projected New Capability (Base Year) 1.3.11.1 Optimization. AMP business rules have traditionally been based on heuristic search algorithms that often perform exhaustive searches to try to schedule each requirement to flow to its destination while minimizing its lateness. While these search strategies yield acceptable solutions, they rely on a one-by-one mode determination and scheduling approach that does not account for all factors simultaneously to provide an optimal solution. The AMP user community has identified the requirement to develop and integrate more robust optimization network design and scheduling capabilities within AMP. These more robust optimization capabilities shall include the ability to develop solutions that are optimized on a variety of user-defined objectives, to include not only a minimization of late deliveries, but also optimized on alternative or competing objectives to include cost, resource requirements, and solution validity in the face of uncertainty. The provision of optimization capabilities should include applicability to and integration with both strategic and theater networks. 1.3.11.1.2 End-to-End Deployment and Distribution Modeling (ETEM) II. (RDT&E) The contractor shall research and begin development of software and documentation for an end-to-end modeling capability that will operate within AMP. The contractor shall develop airlift schedules that are more robust when executed in the real world. For example, an optimized airlift schedule could have features such that many missions end up being blocked from access to a key offload or en route location due to breakdowns of aircraft there and cascading backups through the system leading to gridlock of the system, whereas a robust schedule may not be the most optimized solution but would be less influenced by variations in the decision variables. The contractor shall introduce stochastic methods into AMP's simulation heuristics in order to produce solutions that account for variability. The contractor shall incorporate a Business Rule Management System to adjust optimization/simulation model parameters automatically. The contractor shall develop the ability to create optimization or simulation sub-models of the DTS as viewed by AMP for deeper analysis. Deliverable: Prototype selection report and briefing Projected New Capability (Option Year I): 1.3.11.1.3 Ammunition Distribution Modeling. (T-CAP) The contractor shall design, develop, and integrate the capability to optimize deployment and sustainment ammunition movements within the supply chain.

If the Contracting Officer determines that the mitigation plan is inadequate, remedial actions will be considered, including elimination from the solicitation process, termination of related contract efforts already awarded, or negotiation of the mitigation plan. The above restrictions shall be included in all subcontracts, teaming arrangements, and other agreements calling for performance of work which is subject to the organizational conflict of interest restrictions identified in these provisions.

(2) Performs work on a contract, which requires the use of a CAC for installation entry control or physical access to facilities and buildings. (b) Contractors and their employees shall use the following procedures to obtain CACs: (1) Contractors shall provide a listing of their employees that will require a CAC to the contracting officer. The listing will contain the following information in order for a CAC application to be created in the Contractor Verification System (CVS): last, middle, and first names; Social Security Number (SSN) or foreign identification number (FIN), as applicable; Date of Birth; email address; the contract number; and the contract end date. The contracting officer will provide a copy of the list to the government representative in the local organization designated to authorize issuance of contractor CACs (i.e., Trusted Agent (TA)). The TA will then create a CAC application in the Contractor Verification System (CVS.) The CVS TA on this contract is _________________________________________________________________. (Name, e-mail and phone number). (2) Once the TA has created the CAC application, a temporary login/password will be generated in CVS. The TA will notify each contractor employee when his/her application is created and will securely distribute the login/password to that contractor employee. Each contractor employee will then enter the CVS web site using the temporary login/password and complete the CAC application and submit it back to the TA. This will require the contractor to obtain a Defense Knowledge On-line or similar .mil domain e-mail account working with the sponsoring TA indicated above. (3) If contractor employees will not require access to classified information, the contractor will submit a compiled list of names with biographical data to include SSN or FIN on each employee requiring a CAC. Upon verification by security office ( name, e-mail and phone number) __________________________, those names who do not meet the background investigation criteria for a CAC will be required to complete the Questionnaire for NonSensitive Positions (SF85), located at www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/SF85.pdf, and submit fingerprint cards (FD258) to (security office contact information above or as appropriate if different) _______________________________________ who will verify each employee and then forward the documents to the servicing Security Office _____________________________________.

Upon the favorable review by the security office of the name, fingerprint, and criminal records check, the interim CAC application may be approved. (5) If contractor employees will require access to classified information, the contractor's company Facility Security Officer processes the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF86) and the fingerprint cards (FD-258) and submits them directly to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). In this instance, before the TA approves the CAC application in CVS, the TA must verify that the background investigation, name, fingerprint and criminal records check has been favorably adjudicated before the application for CVS can be processed. (6) Once the TA has approved the CAC application, the TA will inform the contractor employee to proceed to the nearest CAC issuance workstation (usually located within the DEERS/RAPIDS website (insert website) with two

HTC711-13-R-D008 Page 62 of 87 forms of picture identification as indicated on the webiste. CAC issuance workstation personnel will then issue the CAC. (c) While visiting or performing work on government installation(s)/location(s), contractor employees shall wear or prominently display the CAC as required by the governing local policy. (d) During the performance period of the contract, the contractor, or contractor employee as appropriate, shall: (1) Within 7 working days of any changes to the listing of the contract personnel authorized a CAC, provide an updated listing to the contracting officer who will provide the updated listing to the TA (who will create new CAC applications or revoke those for employees no longer performing on the contract as appropriate); (2) As part of security out-processing, or when no longer performing on the specific contract for which the CAC was approved, return their CAC to the TA or DEERS/RAPIDS site. (3) Report lost or stolen CAC's immediately to the TA, the USTRANSCOM Security Services Center, or to a designated USTRANSCOM representative. (e) Within 7 working days following completion/termination of the contract, return all CACs issued to contractor employees to the TA.

CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and (D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a

HTC711-13-R-D008 Page 66 of 87 final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (APR 2012)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority. Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.

The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.

(d) Demonstrate (Applies to Large Businesses Only) that the proposed SB Utilization Strategy is consistent with your proposed SB Subcontracting Plan. (e) If the offeror is a participant in the DoD Comprehensive Subcontracting Test Program specified in DFARS 219.7, the offeror shall describe how Small Business participation on this contract will contribute to its overall Comprehensive Subcontracting plan goals. 5. Price Proposal Offerors shall submit pricing for Task Order 0001 at the subtask level. Offerors shall also complete Attachment 8, the CLIN structure for Task Order 0001. Attachment 8 contains a CLIN for a proposed fixed fee. The proposed fixed fee for Task Order 0001 shall be the fixed fee applied on all future task orders. Because this contract will have a fixed fee, offerors shall not include profit, G&A, or overhead in their labor rates. The offeror's proposed fixed fee cannot be applied to Travel or ODCs. Actual costs will be paid for Travel and ODCs, which may include overhead and G&A. The fixed fee cannot exceed 10% of labor costs, in accordance with FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i)(C). Using Attachment 9, offerors shall provide labor rates for the base period and all option periods for all tasks at the ID/IQ level. These labor rates will be used when preparing proposals for future task orders.

Evaluation Of Options

JUL 1990

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD This is a competitive best value source selection. The following factors/subfactors will be evaluated: (1) TECHNICAL Subfactor 1: Technical Approach for ID/IQ Subfactor 2: Technical Approach for Task Order 0001 Subfactor 3: Phase-In Plan (2) STAFFING (3) PAST PERFORMANCE (4) SMALL BUSINESS PROPOSAL (5) PRICE

Non-price factors are listed in descending order of importance. When combined, all non-price factors are considered approximately equal to price. The Government intends to award a single-award ID/IQ contract as well as Task Order 0001, both with a POP start date of 1 November 2013. Award will be made to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements (to include all terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by the solicitation), and is judged, based on the evaluation factors, to represent the best value to the Government. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors. However, the Government will not pay a price premium that it considers to be disproportionate to the benefits associated with the proposed margin of service superiority. Therefore, the Government will award a contract to the offeror considered to be the best value, all factors considered, given their relative order of importance. The Government reserves the right to award no contract at all depending on the quality of the proposals submitted and subject to availability of funds. The Contracting Officer may limit the competitive range for purposes of efficiency. 1. Technical The three subfactors are of equal importance. Strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiencies may be assigned to the offerors' Technical proposal. The technical ratings evaluate the quality of the offeror's technical solution for meeting the Government's requirement. Offerors will be given color ratings for each of the three subfactors as documented in Table 1. Table 1 ­ DoD Color Ratings COLOR RATING DESCRIPTION

HTC711-13-R-D008 Page 84 of 87 Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies. Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains at least one strength and no deficiencies. Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal has no strengths or deficiencies. Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies and is unawardable.

"Strength" is an aspect of an offeror's proposal that has merit or exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract performance. "Weakness" means a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. A "significant weakness" in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. A "deficiency" is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. Technical Risk: Assessment of technical risk, which is manifested by the identification of weakness(es), considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs, degradation of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. The risk rating considers the risk associated with the technical approach in meeting the requirement. Offerors will be given a risk rating for each of the three subfactors as documented in Table 2. Table 2 ­ DoD Risk Ratings RATING DESCRIPTION Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties. Can potentially cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties. Is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Is unlikely to overcome any difficulties, even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.

Moderate

High

2. Staffing Strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, and deficiencies may be assigned to the offerors' Staffing proposal. The staffing rating evaluates the quality of the offeror's staffing solution for meeting the Government's requirement. Offerors will be given a color rating as documented in Table 1. Staffing Risk: Assessment of staffing risk, which is manifested by the identification of weakness(es), considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased costs, degradation of performance, the need for

HTC711-13-R-D008 Page 85 of 87 increased Government oversight, or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance. The risk rating considers the risk associated with the staffing approach in meeting the requirement. Offerors will be given a risk rating as documented in Table 2. 3. Past Performance The Government will first determine if the effort is considered recent, which means the effort was performed within the last three years (of the proposal due date). Then, by using past performance questionnaires submitted by the offerors' Point of Contacts (POCs) and other information independently obtained from Government or commercial sources, the Government will determine the relevancy of each effort submitted. The following ratings will be used in evaluating the relevancy of the offerors' past performance:     Very Relevant. Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Relevant. Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Somewhat Relevant. Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Not Relevant. Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

Past Performance will be evaluated as a measure of the Government's confidence in the offeror's and principal subcontractor's ability to successfully perform based on previous and current contracts. The relevancy of each reference will be considered in the overall confidence assessment rating for the offeror. One of the following confidence assessment ratings will be assigned to each offeror:  Substantial Confidence. Based on the offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Satisfactory Confidence. Based on the offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Limited Confidence. Based on the offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No Confidence. Based on the offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Unknown Confidence (Neutral). No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offerors performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.





 

Offerors with no recent relevant past or present performance history shall receive an Unknown Confidence meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP.

HTC711-13-R-D008 Page 86 of 87

Past performance regarding predecessor companies or principal subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of this requirement will be weighted the same (equally as important) as the past performance information for the offeror. In addition to past performance information submitted by the offeror, past performance information may be obtained through the (1) Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), (2) Questionnaires tailored to the circumstances for this acquisition, and (3) other sources known to the Government. 4. Small Business Proposal Each offeror's SB Proposal will be evaluated as Acceptable or Unacceptable at the subfactor level. Offerors must receive a rating of Acceptable for both SB Proposal subfactors in order to be considered for award: (a) Subfactor 1 - Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Applies to Large Businesses Only). To be rated acceptable, the offeror's proposed SB Subcontracting Plan must meet all of the requirements in FAR 19.7 and provide sufficient detail to demonstrate how the offeror intends to meet the proposed contract minimum SB subcontracting goals. The information contained in the proposed SB Subcontracting Plan must appear to be realistic based on the types of services to be subcontracted. (b) Subfactor 2 - Small Business Utilization Plan. (Applies to Large and Small Businesses). To be rated acceptable, the offeror's proposed SB Utilization Plan: (1) Provides a detailed description of the services to be performed by each Small Business Concern subcategory proposed. The detailed description appears to be realistic based on the services to be performed under the contract and the offeror's approach to subcontracting. The offeror has also provided the CAGE code, or proposed subcontractor self-certification as a SB concern, for each proposed subcontractor. (2) Provides goals, expressed as dollars and percentages of total contract values and dollars and percentages of total domestic subcontracting values for each category of SB category concern included in Para (1) above. The goals must appear to be realistic based on the services to be performed under the contract and the offeror's approach to subcontracting. (3) Includes a description of the offeror's proposed efforts to ensure the resulting contract meets or exceeds the minimum identified SB subcontracting goals. The description of proposed efforts must appear to be realistic based on the services to be performed under the contract and the offeror's approach to subcontracting. (4) For Large Businesses, demonstrates that the proposed Small Business Utilization Strategy is consistent with their proposed SB Subcontracting Plan. (5) For offerors who are participants in the DoD Comprehensive Subcontracting Test Program, describes how small business participation under this contract will contribute to its overall Comprehensive Subcontracting plan goals. The description must appear to be realistic based on the services to be performed under the contract and the offeror's approach to subcontracting. 5. Price (a) The Government will conduct a price analysis to determine whether the proposed prices for all labor rates and for Task Order 0001 are fair and reasonable. (b) The Government will also conduct a cost realism analysis on Task Order 0001 to determine whether the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform the services being ordered reflects a clear

HTC711-13-R-D008 Page 87 of 87 understanding of the requirements and are consistent with the unique methods of performance described in the offeror's technical proposal. Using the cost realism analysis, the Government will determine the probable cost of performance for each offeror. The probable cost will be determined by adjusting each offeror's proposed cost to reflect any additions or reductions in cost elements to realistic levels based on the results of the cost realism analysis. The probable cost may differ from the offeror's proposed cost and will reflect the Government's best estimate of the cost of any contract that will result from the offeror's proposal. The probable cost will be used for purposes of evaluation to determine best value. (c) For award purposes, the Government will evaluate the offeror's total evaluated price (TEP) for Task Order 0001. FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, is included in this RFP. Pricing for the six-month Extension of Services period will be based on the proposed labor rates in effect on the last day of the final option period. However, the Extension of Services period will not be identified in the resulting contract as an option. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

Basis of Award: Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal conforms to the requirements specified in the Request for Proposal (RFP) and which provides the best value to the government, cost and non-price factors considered. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced Offeror where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors. However, the Government will not pay a price premium that it considers to be disproportionate to the benefits associated with the proposed margin of service superiority.
