I.    OVERVIEW

A.    Agency Information- The U. S. Railroad Retirement Board (“RRB”) is an independent Federal agency that administers a retirement and
      survivor benefits program for railroad employees and their families. The RRB was established by the Railroad Retirement Acts of 1937 and
      1974. Its benefits program was the forerunner of the more familiar Social Security System. The Railroad Retirement System is unique
      inasmuch as it is the only federally administered benefits program covering a single private industry. The RRB also administers the
      Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, which provides unemployment and sickness benefits to railroad employees. The RRB’s headquarters is
      located in Chicago, Illinois.


B.    Performance-based Service Contracting Solicitation/Contract- This solicitation has been developed in response to the Office of Federal
      Procurement Policy (OFPP) policy to increase the use of performance-based contracting methods in the acquisition of services.  Performance-
      based contracting aims to improve the value of contracting services by emphasizing objective, measurable mission-related outputs rather
      than how the work is performed or broad and imprecise statement of work.  It requires objective, measurable performance requirements and
      quality standards in developing statements of work, selecting contractors, determining contract type and incentives, and performing
      contract administration.


C.    Project Information

      currently is no funding available for these services. The RRB is currently funded for Fiscal Year 2011 through March 18th. The RRB may
      award an order or contract for these services once funds become available through the extension of the Federal Government’s Continuing
      Resolution or through the passage of the Federal Government’s appropriation for FY 2011.

      8.    Printer Compatibility and Multi-Functionality Capability


           a.    Data Center initiated printing must function on any of the five (5) printers previously described.  All printers must respond
                 identically to the Data Center output so as to not require any major or minor changes to any output other than redirection to
                 the desired printer.


           b.    Data Center initiated printing will be either established forms coming through PARIS (see section III.E.9) or another forms
                 development/storage management system or as mainframe direct IBM COBOL-generated output (for example COBOL compiler listings,
                 reports, records, files, etc.).


      9.    Data Conversion and Forms Development/Storage/Management System


           123 print jobs and 292 print environments currently exist in the format of the Paris system.  All RRB forms have been converted to
           the Paris system but some legacy forms rely on DJDE language in JCL to set up and initiate the use of the legacy forms.  The Paris
           server hardware and software are owned by the incumbent cost-per-copy printer provider, IKON Office Solutions.


           The new cost-per-copy provider must have full responsibility for the following:


           a.    Provide the RRB with a complete Paris server system, (adequate hardware, latest version of the properly licensed software,
                 etc.), and successfully transfer all existing forms from the current system to their system as required.


           b.    Provide the RRB with a detailed plan to ensure that any downtime on the Paris server is minimized to avoid unnecessary
                 disruption to required print jobs.


           c.    As an alternative to a Paris system, provide a comparable forms development/storage/management system to the RRB and assume
                 full responsibility for converting all existing forms to this system.  This would also require providing training to RRB
                 personnel as addressed in section III.H.  All forms shall be successfully print-tested and accepted by the RRB at the conclusion
                 of the conversion process.  Conversion and training must be completed within three (3) months of contract award.  Conversion and
                 training pricing must be a separate line item distinct from the cost-per-copy costs.


     F.     Consumable Supplies


      1.    All consumable supplies (e.g. toner, developer, fuser agent, wire staple rolls, staple, booklet maker staple cassette, etc.) with the
           exception of paper must be provided by the vendor and delivered to a centralized storage area at the RRB headquarters for the
           resulting contract.


      2.    The vendor must replenish the on-hand consumable supplies within the first five (5) business days of each month to ensure a continual
           stock of supplies for a minimum of 45 days.  The Government must not be responsible for the inventorying of the vendor-furnished
           supplies.  In the event supplies are exhausted prior to the beginning of the next stock replenishment cycle, the vendor shall, when
           requested by the RRB, furnish emergency supplies.  The emergency supplies must be delivered within 24 hours after receipt of the
           RRB’s request and must consist of sufficient quantity to sustain performance of the affected station(s) unit the next replenishment
           of supply stock.



      3.    The vendor must keep an adequate supply of machine parts on-site including such pieces as fuser rollers, loops, toner station(s),
           etc. in order to minimize printer downtime.


   G. Maintenance
      1.    The contractor shall provide maintenance services in accordance with the accepted commercial practice with respect to all machines
           furnished under this contract.  Such service shall include all labor, parts, and consumable supplies, except paper, required to keep
           the equipment working in accordance with the original equipment manufacturers  (OEM) specifications.


                 2.    The contractor shall notify the RRB of all on-site field modifications
           (engineering changes) made available by the OEM within 30 days of
           notice by the OEM.  The contractor shall explain the nature of the
      modification and shall indicate whether the change is optional or mandatory.  Implementation of the change shall be effected when mutually
           agreed upon or within 60 day of availability, whichever is earlier.


                 3.    Maintenance service shall not include electrical work external to the
      equipment; repair of damage resulting from RRB precipitated accident, neglect, or misuse; repair of damage resulting from failure of
           electrical  power, air conditioning or humidity control.


                 4.    Within 20 days after contract award, the contractor shall submit a written
      preventive maintenance (PM) plan to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) specifying both the frequency and duration of
           maintenance required. The schedule shall be subject to the Board’s approval. If a mutually agreed schedule cannot be established, the
           RRB reserves the right to specify a PM schedule.

      5.    The contractor shall provide remedial maintenance service, including the
           provision of labor, parts and consumable supplies (except paper), during
           the principal period of maintenance service upon notification by the RRB
           that equipment needs service.

                 promptly receive the RRB’s request for remedial service by providing a local toll-free telephone number, voice mail, or pager
                 service during the principal period of maintenance service.

           c.    The contractor shall respond to a service call placed by the Board within 2 business hours after initial notification to affect
                 the repair of any malfunctioning or otherwise inoperable machine. The vendor should attempt to have a service technician on site
                 within four (4) hours of the initial maintenance service call.

           d.    If a copier cannot be repaired or made operable within two (2) working days (16 business hours) after the initial notification
                 by the RRB, the contractor shall provide the RRB with a quick copy service capable of a minimum twenty-four hour turnaround
                 while the malfunctioning copier is being repaired at no additional cost to the government.  The quick copy service shall remain
                 in place until the malfunctioning unit has been repaired or for five (5) workdays, whichever is earlier.  If at the end of the
                 backup period, the malfunctioning copier has not been repaired; the contractor shall provide and install, upon written request
                 from the Board, a replacement copier of equal or greater capability at no additional cost to the government.  The contractor
                 shall be responsible for roundtrip pick-up and delivery of all copies produced under the quick copy service.

           e.    The contractor shall provide a sufficient number of personnel who have the technical resources and ability to diagnose and
                 correct complicated and/or intermittent problems involving all components under this contract.  The contractor shall ensure that
                 all contractor personnel conduct themselves in a courteous, professional manner.  All preventive and remedial services shall be
                 performed by fully trained and experienced repair technicians.  The technicians must be trained on the specified components
                 supplied by the contractor.  The contractor shall ensure that all repair technicians receive formal and hands-on training on a
                 continuing basis to ensure that they have current knowledge of all installed components.  The contractor shall provide OEM
                 certification for all personnel employed under this contract.

           f.    The Government shall provide, after award, a list in writing of persons authorized to place service calls and order emergency
                 replenishment supplies for copiers furnished under this contract resulting from the RFP.  The Government will notify the
                 contractor, in writing, of any change(s) made to this list during the term of the contract.

      H.    Training
      The contractor shall provide comprehensive copier training for up to ten (10) RRB employees designated as key operators.  Classroom
      training, if available or on-the-job training shall be provided for each copier installed.  The training should be sufficient to ensure

      installed under this contract.  Any proposed new and/or improved model(s) must be of equal or greater capability as the model to be
      replaced.  The contracting officer will accept or reject new and/or improved models by issuing a modification to the contract.



   J. Contractor Responsibilities
      1.    Responsibility of Government Property - The Contractor
           assumes full responsibility for and shall indemnify the Government for any and all loss of or damage of whatsoever kind and nature to
           any and all Government property, including equipment, supplies, accessories, or parts furnished, while in his custody and care for
           storage, repair or services to be performed under the terms of this contract, or any employee, agent, or representative of the
           Contractor or subcontractor.


      2.    Hold Harmless and Indemnification Agreement  - The Contractor shall hold harmless and indemnify the Government against any and all
           liability claims and costs of whatsoever kind and nature for any injury to or death of any persons or persons and for loss of or
           damage to any property occurring in connection with or in any way incident to or arising out of the occupancy, use, service,
           operations, or performance of work under the terms of this contract, resulting in whole or in part from the negligent acts or
           omissions of the contractor, any subcontractor, or any employee, agent or representative of the contractor of any subcontractor.
           Notwithstanding the foregoing, the contractor will not be liable for consequential damages as defined in the Warranty Exclusion and
           Limitation of Damages provisions, if any contained herein.

      3.    Damage to Government Property from causes other than the Contractor’s Negligence - Nothing in the above paragraph shall be considered
           to preclude the Government from receiving the benefits of any insurance the Contractor may carry which provides for indemnification
           for any loss or destruction of, damage to property in the custody and care of the Contractor where such loss, destruction, or damage
           is to Government Property.  The contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government’s right to recover against third parties for
           any loss, destruction of, or damage to Government property, and upon the request of the Contracting Officer shall, at the
           Government’s expense, furnish to the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including assistance in the prosecution of
           suit and the execution of instruments of assignment in favor to the Government in obtaining recovery.


      4.    Laws and Ordinances - The Offeror shall comply with all laws, ordinances, and regulations (Federal, State, County, City or otherwise)
           covering work of this character and shall include all costs, if any, of such compliance in the prices quoted in this offer.



   K. Damage to Equipment
      All copying equipment provided under this contract remains the property of the contractor.  Therefore, the contractor assumes all
      responsibility for loss or damage to equipment except for loss or damage caused by negligence or willful act of the Government.  For such
      loss or damage, the contractor may submit a claim for reimbursement of equipment repair and/or replacement costs.



   L. Phase-In
      The contractor will provide all resources required to ensure a smooth transition.  The Government requires the maintenance of customer
      support with minimal interruptions/disruptions to daily operations.


      1.    The contractor shall submit, with their proposal, a plan to the COTR specifying the method in which meter reading shall be submitted
           by the Government.


      2.    Government personnel will be responsible for physically taking meter readings on the last business day of each month. These readings
           shall be provided to the contractor on or before the first business day of the next month. The readings will contain the following
           data:  Machine serial number, meter reading, and “unusable copies” count, the number of copies used during service calls, and an
           authorized machine operator signature.


      3.    During the installation, the contractor must demonstrate that all CPC systems are properly working. The contractor shall provide to
           the government a test and acceptance plan within (10) ten days after contract award to the COTR. The demonstration must be
           accomplished pursuant to the operating instructions furnished with each copier and in the presence of the COTR or his/her designated
           representative. Upon satisfactory completion of this demonstration, the appropriate RRB personnel authorized to accept equipment
           under this contract will sign any acceptance document(s). The contractor shall complete testing (5) five business days before
           contract start date.



   M. Phase-Out
      The contractor shall provide all resources required to ensure a smooth transition period in accordance with contract requirements.  The
      Government intends to sustain a maximum level of customer support during this period. The contractor agrees to the performance requirements
      of the contract until all of the new copiers have been installed. The contractor will be reimbursed at the contract rate for all time
      exceeding the contract period in which equipment must remain. The government will require the incumbent contractor to cooperate fully with
      the new contractor to ensure a smooth transition period. This cooperation includes, but is not limited to, tasks associated with the prompt
      removal of copier equipment and consumable supplies as requested by the COTR or his/her designated representative.



   N. Uptime Efficiency Level
      1.    The contractor guarantees that each copier furnished under this contract shall achieve a minimum efficiency level of 95%.  The
           efficiency level will be calculated on an individual machine basis by dividing the number of hours that a particular machine was
           operable in any month by the total number of operational hours in that month.  For purpose of this contract only, the Board’s printer
           operations schedule (workday) shall encompass the following:


            Printer Type                Hours of Operation      Days of Operation


            Remote Printers             12 hours          Monday thru Friday
            Color Printer                     10 hours          Monday thru Friday
            Hi-Speed Printers (PS)      10 hours          Monday thru Friday
            Data Center Printer               24 hours          Monday thru Saturday


      Uptime efficiency will be documented on a monthly basis for all printers under this contract and will be reported during monthly service
           meeting with the vendor.


            2.   If a machine maintained under this contract fails to achieve the minimum required efficiency level for two (2) consecutive
           months, the contractor shall, upon written request by the Board, replace the under-performing machine.  The replacement printer shall
           be delivered, installed and ready for use within ten (10) working days of contractor’s receipt of the written notice.  Replacement
           printers shall be new or remanufactured equipment in current production at the time of replacement and shall meet or exceed both the
           capability and contract specifications applicable to the machine being replaced.  The replacement machine shall be billed at the same
           rate as the machine being replaced.


     O.     Credit for Excessive Downtime
      Each printer furnished under the resulting contract shall perform at a monthly effectiveness level of 95%. The effectiveness level for the
      machine is computed by: the total number of hour’s downtime, divided by the total production time in a month. Total productive time shall
      be computed by multiplying the hours of operations for each printer by the days of operations for each printer (weekends and Federal
      holidays excluded). If the monthly effectiveness level is 95% or higher, there is no credit due under this provision. Failure of any
      particular printer to achieve a monthly effectiveness of 95% shall entitle the Government to unilaterally take credit against the monthly
      billing for each day the equipment is inoperative. The credit shall be a percentage amount of the cost-per-copy monthly charge per machine,
      which shall be determined by subtracting the actual percentage of effectiveness level attained during the month from 100.

   P. Relocation of Printers/Copiers
      The Government reserves the right to relocate copiers furnished under the resultant contract under the following conditions:


      1.    The Contracting Officer (or his/her authorized representative) will make
           every effort to ensure that the contractor is provided with an accurate list of copier installations. However, during the course of
           the contract, copier relocations may be necessary. Therefore, any copier may be relocated (after initial installation) one (1) time
           per contract year at no charge to the Government. Thereafter, if that same copier is relocated, there will be no charge to the
           Government if RRB activity personnel do the moving, while supervised by the contractor’s technical representative. If the
           contractor’s personnel perform the relocation, it will be at the rate proposed and accepted at Section II.B, CLIN 008.  Relocation of
           copiers will be made only by the contractor, except in cases where the contractor determines (prior to the move) that the relocation
           does not require trained moving technical personnel and can be performed by the RRB. This move will be limited to the RRB’s
           headquarters facility.

      2.    The contractor shall be notified by the Contracting Officer (or his/her

       Q.Minimum Copy Guarantee
      The Government’s minimum copy guarantee shall be 10 million “dry “copies and 160,000 full color copies during the initial term of this
      contract. Of the 10 million “dry” copies, approximately 9.5 million will be produced on the hi-speed, hi-volume photocopiers and 500,000
      will be produced on the two (2) remote printers.


      R.    Annual Reconciliation Procedures
      Within two business weeks of the completion of each contract performance year and receipt of the last monthly invoice for that period, the
      Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) Contract Administrator (CA) and Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) will complete a
      reconciliation of Contractor copies provided against Government payments to the Contractor for those cost per copy services. The
      reconciliation will ensure that the Government has paid the contractor for (1) the annual minimum copies guaranteed at that cost-per-copy
      rate in the contract and, (2) copies provided in excess of the minimum guarantee at that specified rate. The RRB CA will then apply a
      credit, if any, against the final invoice for that performance year, equal to the amount of RRB payments exceeding those due to the
      contractor for that performance period. The RRB CA will also notify the Contractor in writing, when applying that credit for the sum of
      annual overpayments.


   S. Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
      1.    Introduction

           The procedures established in this plan will ensure that the RRB receives the quality of service specified in the contract.  Close
           coordination and active cooperation on a daily basis between the vendor and the COTR are necessary to obtain a quality cost-per-copy
           service program.




           Under the Printer/Copier Quality Assurance Plan, the vendor must be evaluated on a monthly basis.  The vendor must be evaluated in
           two (2) :  areas Quality of Service and Customer Complaints.




      2.    Evaluation Factors




           a.    Quality of Service Provided

                 The COTR must keep a monthly performance log for each printer/copier provided under the contract.  During each quarter, the COTR
                 must notate on the Printing System Performance Log (See Attachment A) any end user and/or prime user production problems such as
                 the following:




    • Printer/Copier excessive downtime;

    • Excessive problems with attached peripheral equipment (e.g. booklet maker, make ready workstation, finisher, etc.);

    • Consistently substandard output;

    • Non-response to maintenance issues;

    • Inadequate printer/copier supplies; and

    • Network accessibility (at the printer/copier end)




                    Any performance problems observed during each quarter of service must be documented.  Performance problems must be
                    accumulated and totaled.  Copies of the Printing System Performance Log must be provided to the vendor within three (3)
                    workdays after the end of the rating quarter in which they occur.



    • Poor – There are more than 10 performance issues documented in the Printing System Performance Log.




    • Fair – There are no more than 10 performance issues documented in the Printing System Performance Log.




    • Good – There are no more than 3 performance issues documented in the Printing System Performance Log.




    • Excellent – There are no performance issues documented in the Printing System Performance Log.




           b.    Customer Complaints

                 Customer complaints is a means by which deficiencies can be reported and serve as the basis for unsatisfactory or nonperformance
                 of work.  The COTR must record and attempt to validate each customer complaint received.  Many complaints will be difficult or
                 impossible to validate, but should still be recorded and reviewed to determine if there is a trend or pattern of complaints in
                 the delivery of cost-per-copy services.  Only complaints validated by the COTR that are not the result of operator error must be
                 counted for performance purposes.




    • Poor – There are more than 10 validated complaints per month documented on the Printing System Complaint Log (See Attachment B).




    • Fair – There are no more than 10 documented complaints per month on the Printing System Complaint Log.




    • Good – There are no more than 3 documented complaints per month on the Printing System Complaint Log.




    • Excellent – There are no documented complaints per month on the Printing System Complaint Log.




                 A quality cost-per-copy service is the primary goal of this contract.  During the life of the contract, administrative
                 procedures such as inspection, documentation, and retention of records which reflect vendor performance are to be prepared and
                 retained by the COTR.




                 Deductions must be taken only for illegible copies (as a result of mechanical error) and for excessive downtime (See Section
                 III.O)




                 Poor performance is undesirable, therefore, if the vendor’s performance remains less than fair and fails to adhere to the
                 contract specifications, the contract may be canceled or terminated.  The Government may also contract for the services and
                 charge the vendor for all cost incurred by the Government.




                 Monthly meetings must be held between the vendor and/or his representative and the COTR.  The purpose of the meeting must be to
                 discuss the vendor’s performance, areas of deficiencies, areas of satisfaction, and customer complaints/concerns.




                 If the vendor is non-responsive, meetings and inspections will need to be conducted more frequently.  Once a more reliable
                 service record is established, the inspections and meetings with the vendor can be reduced to normal levels.




   T. Pre-award Survey
      In order to determine responsibility of the Contractor, the Government reserves the right to conduct a pre-award survey of the Contractor’s
      capability by requiring evidence of technical, production, managerial and financial capability to perform prior to the award of a contract.

     X.     Performance Standards
      The vendor must perform the work in compliance with the Performance Standards, as agreed to and contracted for by the RRB.  The performance


      standards must serve as an outline of the business and document management services the vendor must provide the RRB.  The outline must
      include:


      1.    Outline of job-turn-around times

      after the RRB’s notification.


      Y.    RRB Quality Assurance Plan – Evaluation Factors


      1.    Quality of Service
           The COTR must randomly inspect each week a minimum of five (5) print service requests.  During the evaluation, the COTR must notate
           any production errors based on the print requirements and whether or not the print request was completed within the negotiated
           deadline.  Results must be accumulated and totaled for each month.  The vendor must be provided copies of the COTR’s findings.


    • Poor  = More than eight (8) printing job errors per month.


    • Fair  = 4 –7 printing job errors per month.



    • Good = 1 – 3 printing job errors per month.



    • Excellent  = None


      2.    Customer Complaints
           The work performed by the hi-speed, hi-volume operator must be evaluated by customer complaints.


           Customer complaints are a means by which deficiencies can be reported and serve as the basis for unsatisfactory or nonperformance of
           work.  The COTR must record and attempt to validate each customer complaint received.  Many complaints will be difficult or
           impossible to validate, but should still be recorded and reviewed to determine if there is a trend or pattern of complaints in the
           delivery of Print Shop management services.  Only complaints validated by the COTR will be counted for performance purposes. It is
           the goal of the RRB Print Shop to have a customer satisfaction rating of 95 percent or higher.


    • Poor = 3 or more customer complaints per month.


    • Fair = 2 customer complaints per month.



    • Good = 1 customer complaint per month.



    • Excellent = None


      3.    Accurate, timely, and efficient Print Shop support services are the primary goal of this contract.  During the life of the contract,
           administrative procedures such as inspection, documentation, and retention of records which reflect contractor performance, are to be
           prepared and retained.

           Unsatisfactory work is undesirable; therefore, if the contractor’s performance remains less than satisfactory and fails to adhere to
           the contract specifications, the contract may be canceled or terminated.  The Government may also contract for services and charge
           the contractor for all costs incurred by the Government.


           Quarterly meetings will be held between the contractor and /or his on-site representative and the COTR.  The purpose of the meeting
           will be to discuss the contractor’s performance areas of deficiencies, areas of satisfaction and tenant concerns.


           If the Contractor is non-responsive, meetings and inspections will need to be conducted more frequently.  Once a more reliable
           service record is established, then inspections and meetings with the contractor can be reduced to normal levels.

      (15) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular

        (d) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
        (e) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
        (f) Other paragraphs of this clause.
        (g) The Standard Form 1449.
        (h) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
        (i) The specification.
      (20) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
        (a) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
        contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s
        reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is
        required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR
        database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this
        contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
        (b)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
        contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding
        notation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum
        of one business day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements
        of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.
        The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
         (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (20)(b)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement
         at paragraph (20)(b)(i)(c) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed notation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR
         information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect
         information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.


      (c) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect
      an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in
      the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate
      recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment”
      paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
      (d) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
      http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(h)  Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies
    only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge
    and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals—
    (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
    agency;
    (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
    commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
    government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
    embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal
    criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
    these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
    exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
        determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the
        liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
        payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
        of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court
        review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
        under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further
        appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to
        contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent
        tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the
        taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
        full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full
        payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
        11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
      (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
      paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
      Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

|___________________                   |___________________                         |
|___________________                   |___________________                         |

            necessary personnel records and allow the successor to conduct onsite
            interviews with these employees.  If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor shall release them at a mutually

      19.  CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)                 FAR 52.209-5

         (A)(1) THE OFFEROR CERTIFIES, TO THE BEST OF ITS KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF, THAT—
                 (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals—
                   (A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts
                   by any Federal agency;
                   (B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
                   against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing
                   a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the
                   submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making
                   false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”,
                   the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);
                   (C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with,
                   commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
                   (D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
                   amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
                   (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
                       (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is
                       not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to
                       the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
                       (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax
                       liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action
                       is precluded.
                     (2) Examples.
                       (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek
                       Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.
                       Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all
                       judicial appeal rights.
                       (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been
                       issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting
                       the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of
                       the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior
                       opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the
                       taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial
                       appeal rights.
                       (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely
                       payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not
                       currently required to make full payment.
                       (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action
                       is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
                       (ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated
                       for default by any Federal agency.
           (2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary
           management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or
           business segment; and similar positions).

           This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,
           or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.

         (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror
         learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
        (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an
        award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s
        responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting
        Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
        (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good
        faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to
        exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
        (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making
        award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available
        to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

        business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).
        (b) The offeror [ ] has [ ] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000.
        (c) If the offeror checked “has” in paragraph (b) of this provision, the offeror represents, by submission of this offer, that the
        information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and
        complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the following information:
           (1) Whether the offeror, and/or any of its principals, has or has not, within the last five years, in connection with the award to or
           performance by the offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that
           resulted in any of the following dispositions:
                 (i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction.
                 (ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty,
                 reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more.

                   (B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000.
                 (iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an
                 acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs
                 (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision.
           (2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the
           offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence.
        (d) The offeror shall post the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through
        maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7).

              21. UPDATES OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JAN 2011) FAR 52.209-9

        (A) THE CONTRACTOR SHALL UPDATE THE INFORMATION IN THE FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) ON A SEMI-
        ANNUAL BASIS, THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT, BY POSTING THE REQUIRED INFORMATION IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION DATABASE AT
        HTTP://WWW.CCR.GOV.
        (b)(1) The Contractor will receive notification when the Government posts new information to the Contractor’s record.
         (2) The Contractor will have an opportunity to post comments regarding information that has been posted by the Government. The comments
         will be retained as long as the associated information is retained, i.e., for a total period of 6 years. Contractor comments will

         (3)(i) Public requests for system information posted prior to April 15, 2011, will be handled under Freedom of Information Act

           performance reviews, will be publicly available.

        following paragraph (a)(2):
           (2) At the first semi-annual update on or after April 15, 2011, the Contractor shall post again any required information that the

      22.  Billing
         Contractor shall submit detailed invoices with quantities for work completed and pricing as designated in Section II.B and indicating
         actions, dates and deliverables completed.

           23. Conflicts of interest
             The offeror agrees not to have any direct or indirect financial or familiar
             interest, or engage in any activity, which conflicts substantially, or appears
             to conflict substantially, with the offeror’s duties under this contract.  The
             offeror further agrees that the RRB shall have the exclusive right to
             determine whether such a conflict of interest exists, and whether it is
             substantial.  Failure of the offeror to adhere to this provision will, at the
             discretion of the RRB, result in the immediate termination of the contract
             without any further liability of the RRB.

      24.  Post-award meeting
             In order to codify the implementation and procedural issues attendant
             upon contract performance, a post-award meeting will be held at the
                  RRB headquarters facility in Chicago, IL or via a conference call no later
                  than ten calendar days after contract award.  The Contractor must attend
                  this conference and be prepared to discuss the requirements of the contract.
                  The Contractor will be responsible for all costs related to attending this
                  meeting.

      25. EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION (JAN 2009) FAR 52.222-54
            (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

                 (i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at 2.101);


                 (ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and


                 (iii) Offered to the Government, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and

             ship without mark or count, in a loose unpackaged form, having homogenous characteristics. Bulk cargo loaded into intermodal
             equipment, except LASH or Seabee barges, is subject to mark and count and, therefore, ceases to be bulk cargo.


            "Employee assigned to the contract" means an employee who was hired after November 6, 1986, who is directly performing work, in the
           United States, under a contract that is required to include the clause prescribed at 22.1803. An employee is not considered to be
           directly performing work under a contract if the employee--


                (1) Normally performs support work, such as indirect or overhead     functions; and


                (2) Does not perform any substantial duties applicable to the contract.


                  "Subcontract" means any contract, as defined in 2.101, entered into by a
           subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of a prime contractor a subcontract. It includes but is not limited to
           purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders.


           "Subcontractor" means any supplier, distributor, vendor, or firm that furnishes supplies or services to or for a prime Contractor or
           another subcontractor.


                  "United States," as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a) (38), means the 50 States,          the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico,
Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.


           (b) Enrollment and verification requirements. (1) If the Contractor is not enrolled as a Federal Contractor in E-Verify at time of
           contract award, the Contractor shall--


                 (i) Enroll. Enroll as a Federal Contractor in the E-Verify program within 30 calendar days of contract award;


                 (ii) Verify all new employees. Within 90 calendar days of enrollment in the E-Verify program, begin to use E-Verify to initiate
                 verification  of employment eligibility of all new hires of the Contractor, who are working in the United States, whether or not
                 assigned to the contract, within 3 business days after the date of hire (but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section); and


                 (iii) Verify employees assigned to the contract. For each employee assigned to the contract, initiate verification  within 90
                 calendar days after date of enrollment or within 30 calendar days of the employee's assignment to the contract, whichever date
                 is later (but see paragraph (b)(4) of this section).


             (2) If the Contractor is enrolled as a Federal Contractor in E-Verify at time of contract award, the Contractor shall use E-Verify
             to initiate verification of employment eligibility of--


                 (i) All new employees. (A) Enrolled 90 calendar days or more. The Contractor shall initiate verification  of all new hires of
                 the Contractor, who are working in the United States, whether or not assigned to the contract, within 3 business days after the
                 date of hire (but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section); or


                       (B) Enrolled less than 90 calendar days. Within 90 calendar days after enrollment as a Federal Contractor in E-Verify, the
                       Contractor shall initiate verification  of all new hires of the Contractor, who are working in the United States, whether

                 within 90 calendar days after date of contract award or within 30 days after assignment to the contract, whichever date is later
                 (but see paragraph (b)(4) of this section).


              (3) If the Contractor is an institution of higher education (as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a)); a State or local government or the
              government of a Federally recognized Indian tribe; or a surety performing under a takeover agreement entered into with a Federal
              agency pursuant to a performance bond, the Contractor may choose to verify only employees assigned to the contract, whether
              existing employees or new hires. The Contractor shall follow the applicable verification requirements at (b)(1) or (b)(2),
              respectively, except that any requirement for verification  of new employees applies only to new employees assigned to the
              contract.


             (4) Option to verify employment eligibility of all employees. The Contractor may elect to verify all existing employees hired after
             November 6, 1986, rather than just those employees assigned to the contract. The Contractor shall initiate verification for each
             existing employee working in the United States who was hired after November 6, 1986, within 180 calendar days of--


                 (i) Enrollment in the E-Verify program; or


                 (ii) Notification to E-Verify Operations of the Contractor's decision to exercise this option, using the contact information

                 and deny access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the terms of the MOU. In such case, the Contractor will be referred to
                 a suspension or debarment official.


                 (ii) During the period between termination of the MOU and a decision by the suspension or debarment official whether to suspend

                 official determines not to suspend or debar the Contractor, then the Contractor must reenroll in E-Verify.

           for identification of the parties), in each subcontract that--


                (1) Is for--

       the Act may involve the imposition of criminal penalties.

           3. PRIVACY ACT (APR 1984) FAR 52.224-2
          (a) The Contractor agrees to -

           development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically

                 (i) The systems of records; and

           which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular
           assigned to the individual.

      F.    SERVICE CONTRACT ACT CLAUSES

            1.   WAGE DETERMINATION
           Offerors are advised that the various classes of service employees who will be employed in the performance of the contract awarded
           under this Request for Quote must be paid the minimum monetary wage and shall be furnished fringe benefits shown on the attached Wage
           Determination No. 2005-2167(R10) (See Attachment 9). This determination was issued under the provisions of the McNamara-O’Hara
           Service Contract Act (79 Stat. 1034), and in accordance with Part 4.3 of 29 CFR Part 4.

      2.    STATEMENT OF EQUIVALENT RATES OF FEDERAL HIRES (MAY 1989)
           In compliance with the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, and the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4), this
           clause identifies the classes of service employees expected to be employed under the contract and states the wages and fringe
           benefits payable to each if they were employed by the contracting agency subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5341 or 5332.

           THIS STATEMENT IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY: IT IS NOT A WAGE DETERMINATION

            Employee                          Monetary   Fringe
            Class      Occupational Title          Wage        Benefit

            GS-9       Desktop Publisher           $24.91      $6.23




       3.        Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Act - Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option Contracts) (Sept 2009) FAR
           52.222-43
           (a) This clause applies to both contracts subject to area prevailing wage determinations and contracts subject to collective
           bargaining agreements.


           (b) The Contractor warrants that the prices in this contract do not include any allowance for any contingency to cover increased
           costs for which adjustment is provided under this clause.


           (c) The wage determination, issued under the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.), by the
           Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, current on the anniversary date
           of a multiple year contract or the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract. If no such determination
           has been made applicable to this contract, then the Federal minimum wage as established by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor
           Standards Act of 1938, as amended, (29 U.S.C. 206) current on the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or the beginning of
           each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract.


           (d) The contract price, contract unit price labor rates, or fixed hourly labor rates will be adjusted to reflect the Contractor's
           actual increase or decrease in applicable wages and fringe benefits to the extent that the increase is made to comply with or  the
           decrease is voluntarily made by the Contractor as a result of:


                 (1) The Department of Labor wage determination applicable on the anniversary date of the multiple year contract, or at the
                 beginning of the renewal option period. For example, the prior year wage determination required a minimum wage rate of $4.00 per
                 hour. The Contractor chose to pay $4.10. The new wage determination increases the minimum rate to $4.50 per hour. Even if the
                 Contractor voluntarily increases the rate to $4.75 per hour, the allowable price adjustment is $.40 per hour;


                 (2) An increased or decreased wage determination otherwise applied to the contract by operation of law; or


                 (3) An amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that is enacted after award of this contract, affects the minimum wage,
                 and becomes applicable to this contract under law.


         (e) Any adjustment will be limited to increases or decreases in wages and fringe benefits as described in paragraph (4) of this clause,
         and the accompanying increases or decreases in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but shall
         not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.


         (f) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any increase claimed under this clause within 30 days after receiving a new
         wage determination unless this notification period is extended in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall promptly
         notify the Contracting Officer of any decrease under this clause, but nothing in the clause shall preclude the Government from
         asserting a claim within the period permitted by law. The notice shall contain a statement of the amount claimed and the change in
         fixed hourly rates (if this is a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract), and any relevant supporting data, including payroll
         records, that the Contracting Officer may reasonably require. Upon agreement of the parties, the contract price, contract unit price
         labor rates, or fixed hourly rates shall be modified in writing.  The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on or
         determination of any such adjustment and its effective date.


         (g) The Contracting Officer or an authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books,
         documents, papers and records of the Contractor until the expiration of 3 years after final payment under the contract.

V.    INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUNE 2008) FAR
      52.212-1
      (a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size
      standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a
      concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500
      employees.


      (b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified
      in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a
      minimum, offers must show -


           (1) The solicitation number;


           (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;


           (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;

           (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or
           similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant
           information); and

           (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions,
           and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms
           and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.


      (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified
      for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.


      (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of
      offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at
      the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.


      (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for
      satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.


      (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.  (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any
      modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the
      solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government
      office on the date that offers or revisions are due.


           (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation
           after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made,
           the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and -


                       (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the
                       initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date
                       specified for receipt of offers; or


                       (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt
                       of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or


                       (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.


                 (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will
                 be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.


           (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that
           installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or
           statements of Government personnel.


           (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government
           office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude
           amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be
           deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government
           processes resume.


           (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in
           response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via
           facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the
           solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by  an offeror or its authorized representative if,
           before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs
           a receipt for the offer.


      (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without
      discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical
      standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be
      necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and
      waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.


      (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
      limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The
      Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered,
      unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.


      (i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation. (1)(i) The GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and
      Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR Part 101-29, and copies of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this

      5.    Other information the contractor determines appropriate and relevant to the evaluation team.

       C.   Technical Proposal
      The offeror shall provide their technical proposal with sections separated as described below.  The technical proposal shall include a
      description of the services being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the mandatory requirements and the evaluated
      technical factors of the solicitation.


      The offeror shall fully and clearly address each mandatory and evaluated technical factor so that the RRB’s technical evaluation panel can
      identify and comprehend the capability and resources the offeror intends to bring to this procurement.

      The technical proposal shall provide complete and detailed information to substantiate the offeror’s ability to satisfy the mandatory
      requirements in Section III.  All mandatory requirements shall be met for an offeror to be considered responsive.

      Complete and detailed technical information shall also be provided to facilitate scoring of the following evaluated technical factors:

      1.    Equipment Offered
           Consideration will be given to the equipment offered.  All offered equipment must meet the RRB’s minimum requirements to receive full
           scoring.


      2.    Maintenance Plan
           Consideration will be given to offers that exceed the solicitation’s minimum requirements in the following regards:


               • Less than 2 hour response time for remedial maintenance service;
               • Sufficient replacement parts such as loops, developer, fuser oil, etc. kept on-site;
               • Provide telephone numbers for service and technicians.


      3.    Equipment Implementation Plan
           Consideration will be given to the offeror’s implementation plan which demonstrates the following:


               • A clear and concise plan which minimizes disruption of cost-per-copy services to the agency;
               • Provision of start-up and ongoing supplies; and
               • Training of designated key operators.


      4.    Past Performance
           Past performance on similar contracts which demonstrate the offeror’s capability to meet the agency requirements including;


              a. Quality of service, which includes the contractor’s compliance with contract requirements;
              b. Timeliness of performance, which includes the contractor’s reliability as well as the ability to meet contractually established
                 deadlines;
              c. Customer satisfaction, which includes satisfaction of end users with the  contractor’s service;
              d. Business relations, which includes the contractor’s ability to cooperate with the client in addition to the ability to respond
                 to inquiries in an effective manner;
              e. Assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be one means of evaluating the credibility of the offeror’s proposal and
                 relative capability to meet performance requirements.
                     • Information utilized will be obtained from the reference listed in the proposal, other customers know to the Government,
                       consumer protection organizations, and others who may have useful and relevant information.  Information will also be
                       considered regarding any significant subcontractors, and key personnel records.
                     • Evaluation of past performance will often be quite subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and
                       circumstances.  It will include determination of the offerors commitment to customer satisfaction and will include
                       conclusions of informed judgment.  However, the basis for conclusions of judgment will be documented.
                     • Award may be made from the initial offers, without discussions.  However, if discussions are held, offerors will be given
                       an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to
                       review the rating.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  Prompt
                       corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.
                     • If an offeror does not have a past performance history relating to the solicitation, the offeror will not be evaluated
                       favorably or unfavorably on this factor.


      5.    Uptime Efficiency
           Consideration will be given to an offered efficiency level that exceeds the minimum solicitation requirement of 95%.


      6.    Staff Coverage
           Consideration will be given an offeror who describes their plans for staff coverage addressing sick absence, call/show, vacations,
           and leave of absences.

VI.   EVALUATION AND AWARD
      The RRB will evaluate proposals in accordance with the following FAR Clause and as specified below:

      A. EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) FAR 52.212-2

          (1) THE GOVERNMENT WILL AWARD A CONTRACT RESULTING FROM THIS SOLICITATION TO THE
           responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most
           advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The
           following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:


            a. Business Proposal

                 1.   The total evaluated price for each offeror shall be the total firm-
                    fixed price offered for all services (CLINS 001-010) listed in Section II.B.

                 2.     Calculation of the “price score” (100 possible points) shall be
                     computed by multiplying the maximum point score available by a fraction representing the ratio of the lowest total evaluated
                     price of all technically acceptable offers received by the Board to the total evaluated price of the offer being evaluated.


           b. Technical Proposal


                 1.    Calculation of the “technical score” will be accomplished by adding all points earned through objective evaluation of each
                       proposal.


                 2.    The technical factors are listed below in descending order of importance:


                         a. Equipment Offered (see section V.C.1)
                         b. Maintenance Plan (see section V.C.2)
                         c. Equipment Implementation Plan (see Section V.C.3)
                         d. Past Performance (See section V.C.4)
                         e. Uptime Efficiency (See section V.C.5)
                         f. Staff Coverage (See section V.C.6)

            c.  Evaluation Formula
              The following formula will be used as a guide by the RRB in determining which offer is most advantageous to the RRB.

              Total Proposal Score = (Technical Score) + (Price Score)

              For purposes of this evaluation, the relative weighting of technical factors to price factors shall be 2:1.

            (2) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for
           the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.
           Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).


           (3) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for
           acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s
           specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its
           receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.


      B.  Evaluation of Options (July 1990)-Far 52.217-5
        Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government’s best interest, the Government will evaluate
        offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Evaluation of options
        will not obligate the Government to  exercise the option(s).

      C.  General
        1.       To be considered responsive to this requirement, the offeror must comply with the format and content specified.  Offerors whose
           proposals are deemed deficient in this regard may be permitted, at the RRB’s discretion, to remedy the deficiency by submitting
           additional clarifying or supplemental information.


        3.       Proposals will be first reviewed for content conformance to proposal preparation instructions.  Proposals which are so
           deficient in these areas as to not warrant further consideration will be rejected and the offeror will be so notified.

        4. Responsive proposals will be evaluated to determine the relative technical merit of each response.  Accordingly, the objective of
           this technical evaluation is to measure the extent to which proposals meet the requirements as stated in the Statement of Work.


        5.       The Government will evaluate the proposals received and award a
           contract, subject to the availability of funds, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the Best
           Value to the Government, price and other factors (including project plan, timeline and documentation) considered.

                                           NOTIFICATION OF PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS


Background

Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors,
established a policy for all Federal agencies to create and use a government-wide secure and reliable form of identification for their Federal
employees and contractors. This policy is intended to ensure a more complete, reliable, and trusted identification of individuals and for
controlling the access of Federal employees and contractors to Federal physical facilities and information systems.

This notification is issued to applicants for employee and certain contractor positions with the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) to describe the
personal identity verification policies of this agency.


Applicant Identification Responsibilities

As an applicant for a position as an employee or contractor with the RRB, you are required to do the following in order to complete your
application process:
    • Appear in person before the appropriate RRB official and present two forms of identity source documents to prove your claimed identity.
      The identity source documents must be in original form and come from the list of acceptable documents shown below. At least one document
      shall be a valid State or Federal government issued picture identification (ID).
    • Complete and bring with you the enclosed Standard Form (SF) 85, OPM Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, or an equivalent form to
      provide the required background information; so that a background check can be completed, unless one was previously done, remains on file,
      and can be referenced. (For additional copies of this form go to http://www.opm.gov/forms.)
    • Submit to having your picture and fingerprints taken.

Once a background check has been completed, and no derogatory information is developed, you will be required to:
    • Appear in person to the authorized RRB official to collect your PIV (Personal Identity Verification) Card. At that time, you will again be
      required to present a state or Federal government picture identity source document to verify that you are the same individual as the one
      who applied for the employee or contractor position and submitted the identity information required under this policy.
    • Accept the PIV Card by signing for the card and acknowledging the related responsibilities.


Responsibilities of Holding a PIV Card

When you are issued a PIV Card, you have the following responsibilities regarding its care and protection. You will be asked to sign a statement
acknowledging your responsibilities. Some of the important responsibilities are:


    • You are required to protect your PIV Card from loss or theft. However, in the event that your card is lost or stolen, you must report the
      loss within 24 hours of noting its disappearance.
    • You agree that you will not attempt to clone, modify, or obtain data from any PIV Card.
    • You agree that you will not assist others in gaining unauthorized access to Federal facilities or information.


Protection of Applicant Information

The following information provided by you will be used as part of the process of identity proofing, registration/enrollment, conducting a
background investigation, and issuance of a PIV Card:
    • Applicant’s full name;
    • Date and place of birth;
    • Identity source documents; and
    • Other relevant information useful for proving the claimed identity of the applicant.

This information will be stored in secure electronic media or in locked files. Access to the records is limited to those individuals who have a
need to know the information in order to perform official functions under the PIV issuance process.


Notification of Results of Identity Proofing

If, as a result of the identity proofing process, you are deemed ineligible to be appointed to the position for which you applied and to be
issued an official RRB identity document, you will be notified in writing of the identity proofing results. You will also be notified at that
time of any additional rights you have under the RRB’s identity proofing processes.


Rights If PIV Card Is Not Approved for You

If you are denied a PIV Card, you have the right to appeal that decision Your appeal should start with a request to the Director of Human
Resources to review your case. [Note: If the position/contract you seek is in the Office of Inspector General (OIG), you should appeal to the
Assistant Inspector General for Investigations in the OIG.] Your request must be made within five workdays of receiving notification of the
denial, and should specify the basis for your belief that the decision to deny you a PIV Card was incorrect. If you are not satisfied with the

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.50 per hour or $140.00 per week or $606.67 per month VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &. SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work) .

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

UNIFORM ALLOWANCE

**

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to

this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
 agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
 affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
 and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in
 those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
 materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
 not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
 laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
 of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
 there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.
 The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
 "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
 unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
 links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
 gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at

 REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
 1444 (SF 1444)}
 Conformance Process:
 The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
 not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
 be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
 determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
 relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
 classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such
 conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
 fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by
 the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
 of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
 be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C) (vi)}
 When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
 conformed.
 The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:
 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
 occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).
 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
 proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
 proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
 rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
 authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
 representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the
 contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
 performs any contract work.
 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
 of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
 information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
 and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
 for review. (See section 4.6(b) (2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).
 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
 disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
 notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process

the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
