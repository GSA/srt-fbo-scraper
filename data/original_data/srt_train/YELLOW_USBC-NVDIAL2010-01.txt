Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the contracting officer through the ordinary mails. However, the judiciary will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (1) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. Due Date

No legal liability on the part of the judiciary for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. I.8 JP3 CLAUSE 7-130, INTEREST (PROMPT PAYMENT) (JAN 2003)

The provisions of the Prompt Payment Act of 1982 and OMB Budget Circular A-125 concerning interest on overdue payments are not applicable to the judiciary. Therefore, interest is not payable under this contract for overdue payments. I.9 YEARLY APPROPRIATIONS

The funding for judiciary expenditures is dependent upon yearly appropriations from Congress. In the unlikely event the Court is unable to process Contractor's invoices due to a lapse in funding, the Contractor shall not interrupt, disrupt, terminate, and/or interfere with services provided and/or to be provided to the Court in any shape, form, or manner nor will the Contractor impose penalties of any sort.

The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. Nothing contained in the foregoing will be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision.

The following are special instructions for completing the Pricing Forms. (1) The quantities identified in this contract are estimates only. Actual quantities may be less than, equal to, or greater than the estimated quantities at the time of contract award and/or after contract award. Any changes to these quantities will result in modification to the delivery order(s). Where quantities for facilities, services, and items change, the total prices will be adjusted based on the changed quantities using the quoted unit prices. The Offeror shall identify the "basis" for the proposed pricing (e.g., commercial list price, GSA Schedule, and so forth). The Base Quote Forms for each Court location, contain the total installation price, the total monthly recurring price, and the total cost for each period of the contract as noted. These prices must be consistent with the corresponding prices shown on the corresponding Forms for Installation Prices and Monthly Recurring Prices. The Forms with Intra-Lata Usage Prices contain the per-call usage charges for intraLATA calls for each Court location. These schedules shall list the per-minute usage charges for all calls outside the flat-rate calling area during normal business hours (from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday).

The Offeror shall insert rows and CLINs in the forms as necessary to list all facilities, services, and charges required to meet the requirements and specifications herein. Generic names for each required facility, service, and charge are listed in the second column of the Forms. Because these items are referred to with different marketing names by the different providers, the Provider Designation (third column) on these forms shall be completed by the Offeror. This designation will be the marketing name the Contractor uses to refer to the facility, service, or charge listed. For example, providers may refer to the DS1 facility as DSS (Digital Switched Services), T1, HiCAP, or another designation. The unit prices for facilities, services, and other items shall not include federal, state, or local taxes and duties in effect on the contract date that the taxing authority is imposing and collecting of the transactions or property covered by this contract. A separate, itemized list of these taxes that would be included in the monthly invoices, including the name of the tax, jurisdiction by name, and applicable tax rate shall be provided. Excepted taxes, as defined in JP3 Clause 6-40, shall be included in the contract clause but not itemized on the monthly invoices. See Paragraph H.7 for further information regarding taxes.

SUBMISSION OF INITIAL PROPOSALS

The Government reserves the right to make award on the basis of the initial proposal submission; therefore, Offerors should submit initial proposals which respond most favorably to the Government's requirements. M.3 EVALUATION PROCESS - GENERAL

This procurement is being conducted using formal source selection procedures, and contract award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, and is determined to be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the requirements stated below. The evaluation will be conducted using the evaluation criteria as set forth in this Section. The Government reserves the right to determine the specific order and duration of individual activities as the evaluation proceeds, or call for discussions, proposal clarifications, or revisions at any time as may be determined to be in the Government's best interests. Each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. Proposal clarification/revision requests may be issued which encompass any and all written documentation submitted in response to the RFP as may be deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, to fully explore and evaluate the merits of proposals submitted. Offerors are hereby notified that the Court will utilize a private consultant to assist in the evaluation of proposals. The consultant will have access to any and all information contained in an Offeror's proposal and will be subject to the appropriate conflict of interest, standards of conduct, and confidentiality restrictions. M.3.1 Evaluation Approach Each proposal shall be initially evaluated for: (1) responsiveness to the solicitation, agreed upon terms and conditions, and (2) the ability to satisfy the requirements of the solicitation. The Court reserves the right to consider as acceptable only those proposals that are submitted in accordance with all requirements set forth or referenced in this solicitation. Offerors shall demonstrate an understanding of all requirements and a capability to provide the required facilities, services, and items. The Court reserves the right to reject
U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEVADA M-1

RFP NUMBER: USBC-NV-DIAL-2010.01

proposals that do not address the totality of the solicitation requirements, including the contract terms and conditions. Only those proposals considered to be in compliance with all requirements herein shall be evaluated further for technical acceptability, technical and management excellence, and price reasonableness. M.3.2 Technical Acceptability The Government will evaluate each Offeror's proposal for compliance with the requirements of the following paragraphs and associated subparagraphs: C.2, C.3, C.4, C.5, C.6, C.7, E.3, and F.5. To be considered technically acceptable, a proposal must respond to and clearly indicate compliance with all the requirements of these Paragraphs (including associated subparagraphs), in accordance with the instructions contained in Section L, Subparagraph L.11.1, a. The Government will also evaluate each Offeror's proposal for compliance with the requirements of Sections D, E, F, G, H, I, and all associated paragraphs and subparagraphs. To be considered technically acceptable, a proposal must clearly indicate compliance with all requirements of these Sections (including associated paragraphs and subparagraphs), in accordance with the instructions contained in Section L, Subparagraph L.11.1, b. Any Offeror failing to comply with all of the requirements and specifications of these Sections, Paragraphs (including associated subparagraphs) will be deemed technically unacceptable, and will be dropped from further consideration for contract award. M.3.3 Technical and Management Excellence The Technical and Management Excellence Factors will be evaluated to determine which proposal offers the best management value to the government. Although price/cost is considered secondary to technical capabilities, it will be a significant criterion for award as part of an integrated assessment with the Technical and Management Excellence Section. The following factors are of equal importance. For each factor, the evaluation will consist of an assessment of the degree to which the facilities, services, and items offered in the proposal provide added value, added capability, and/or reduced risk. Answers to the questions contained in Attachment A: Information Form will be evaluated as part of this assessment. It shall be noted that some factors may consists of sub-factors which are of equal importance. See subparagraphs (including associated subparagraphs) referenced below for a list of associated sub-factors. Technical and Management Excellence Factors a. Technical Excellence (Subparagraph L.11.1, c) b. Management and Business Risk - Corporate Experience and Past Performance (Subparagraph L.11.2) The evaluation assessment of items a and b, will be depicted by narrative and an overall score for each proposal based on the following: a. b. c. d. EXCELLENT: Enhanced performance and/or service level that is of benefit to the judiciary, and/or the proposed approach is of low risk. GOOD: Satisfactory performance and/or service level and the proposed approach is of moderate risk. MARGINAL: Reduced performance and/or service level, and/or the proposed approach is of high risk. POOR: Unacceptable performance and/or service level and/or the proposed approach is of unacceptably high risk.

Technical Excellence, Corporate Experience, and Past Performance will be evaluated to determine both the Offeror's capability to perform the requirements of this RFP and to determine recent customer satisfaction
U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEVADA M-2

RFP NUMBER: USBC-NV-DIAL-2010.01

with the Offeror and the facilities, services, and items provided under their contract. As part of this assessment, the Government will consider the Offeror's abilities for successful performance of the contract, abilities to meet contractual schedules within proposed costs, abilities to fulfill and deliver customer requirements, the actual performance of facilities, services, and other items provided, and the level of customer satisfaction. The Government will also consider the number of references provided by each Offeror. Offeror's with less past performance (fewer references) will not be penalized in the scoring. The score for the experience provided will be averaged based on the number of references provided. Similarly, Offerors with no past performance will receive a "neutral" rating. However, the amount of past performance will be considered as a risk factor in the source selection, decision-making process, with less past performance considered a higher risk to the Government. M.3.4 Evaluation of Information From Other Sources The Government reserves the right to utilize all information available at the time of evaluations. The Government may rely on information made available through reference checks, information available through commercial sources (such as Dunn and Bradstreet reports), and information publicly available (such as articles contained in periodicals). If information obtained through sources outside of the Offeror, substantially disagrees with the Offeror's proposal, the Offeror will be given an opportunity to address the inconsistencies during discussions and negotiations. Current users of the service also may be contacted to determine satisfaction with the Offeror/Provider's facilities, services, and related items. M.3.5 Price Evaluation Offerors' proposed prices will be evaluated for reasonableness and offers containing unrealistic prices will not be considered for award. The total price for the base period and all option periods will be added together resulting in the total evaluated price. See Paragraph M.3.6 for additional information regarding unrealistic proposals. M.3.6 Unrealistic Proposals Offerors are placed on notice that any proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unreasonably high or low in cost or price may be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements and may be grounds for the rejection of the proposal. M.3.7 Evaluation of Options Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options. Offers containing any charges for failure to exercise any option will be rejected. M.4 CONTRACT AWARD

The Government intends to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation. Contract award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer represents the best overall value to the Government, given the outcome of the Government's evaluation of each Offeror's technical proposal and price. In selecting the best overall value, the Government will consider the quality offered for the evaluated price. The relative quality of offers will be based upon the Government's assessment of the tradeoffs between the technical excellence offered in the proposal and whether it provides added value, added capability, and/or reduced risk.
