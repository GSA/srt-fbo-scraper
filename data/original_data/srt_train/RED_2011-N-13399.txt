Title of Project:  National Immunization Survey

C.1  Background and Need
The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Immunization Services Division (ISD) and the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS), Division of Health Interview Statistics (DHIS), both centers of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the
United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), require the planning and conduct of the National Immunization Survey (NIS) and
State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS) and related tasks.

Vaccination for childhood diseases has proven to be one of the most effective public health measures available.  This has been shown through the
reduction in the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases throughout the United States.  The adoption of laws for vaccinations as a requirement
for school entry has been credited with high vaccination levels in this population.  The 1989-1990 measles outbreak in the United States brought
into focus the public health problem of under-vaccination among preschool children.  Healthy People 2020 objectives for immunization and
infectious diseases include reaching high proportions of children receiving recommended vaccinations by their second birthday and adolescents
receiving additional recommended vaccinations by 13-15 years of age.

In 1992, the 50 States and 28 local areas were awarded grants to improve the vaccination levels of children by their second birthday, and
improve related service delivery, information and education, and assessment activities.  Each grantee area developed an Immunization Action Plan
(IAP) for the use of these funds and proposed approaches to improve the immunization delivery system in their areas (referred to as IAP areas).
Determination of vaccination levels and changes over time was necessary for monitoring the success of the grants to these IAP areas.

The NIS was established in response to the immediate and continuing need for quality and timely data pertaining to the vaccination coverage of
pre-school children across the United States.  Beginning in 1994, in addition to national vaccination coverage data collected via the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the NCHS and the National Immunization Program (NIP), which is now NCIRD, began collecting vaccination
information for children 19-35 months in these 78, non-overlapping geographic IAP areas across the United States via the NIS, based on a random-
digit-dial (RDD) sample of households with immunization provider record check verification.  This information has been used to monitor the need
for vaccinations among 19-35 month old children in each IAP area and nationally in the civilian noninstitutionalized population.

During 2005 and 2006, some of the non-grantee IAP areas were rotated off the survey (no longer oversampled) to allow new selected sub-State
areas to be oversampled.  Starting with 2007 data collection, the 22 IAP areas that did not receive direct Section 317 immunization grant
funding from CDC were no longer automatically oversampled.  Starting in 2007, state immunization programs were offered the opportunity to direct
grant funds to oversample sub-State areas of their choice.  This change resulted in core NIS data collection in 56 non-overlapping,
geographically defined Local Sampling Areas (LSAs), including the 50 states and six urban areas that receive Section 317 immunization grant
funding directly from CDC (District of Columbia; City of Chicago, IL; City of New York, NY; Philadelphia County, PA; Bexar County, TX; and City
of Houston, TX).  Additional sub-state areas and U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions may be added and may vary from year to year.

By 2006, three new vaccines had been licensed and recommended for routine use in adolescents:  meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4), tetanus,
diphtheria, acelluar pertussis (Tdap), and (for girls) quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4).  In the 4th quarters of 2006 and 2007,
the NIS-Teen was conducted using the NIS sampling frame and methods to estimate vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years.  In
2008, the NIS-Teen sample was expanded to provide estimates for the 56 core NIS LSA’s, and starting in 2009 additional sub-state areas were
added at the request of some states.  It is possible that CDC may need to change the age range of children included in the NIS in the future.

The NIS has periodically added topical modules to the household interview to collect additional vaccine-related information as needed by CDC.  A
health insurance module to determine status of eligibility for the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) was added in 2003 and became part of the
core NIS survey in 2006.  Recent modules have included expanded questions related to socioeconomic status and parental hesitancy to vaccinate
their children.  Surveys of adult vaccination were conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2007.  During October 2009-June 2010, questions were asked of
children of all ages identified during NIS screening to monitor seasonal and monovalent 2009 (H1N1) influenza vaccinations.  These data were
combined with a stand-alone dual frame landline and cell phone RDD influenza vaccination survey to comprise the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey
(NHFS).

The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) collects data and compiles statistical information to guide actions and policies to improve the
health of the US population, to reduce health disparities, and to improve access to medical care and services.  A variety of approaches are used
to efficiently obtain information from the sources most able to provide information.  The Division of Health Interview Statistics (DHIS)
collects data directly from general and specific populations on a broad range of health topics via person-based surveys and linkage to
administrative data.  One of these programs is the State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS), a mechanism for conducting ad hoc
surveys that uses the same sampling frame as the National Immunization Survey.
SLAITS is supported by sponsors who provide all of the funds required to conduct periodic or one-time surveys.  Sponsors, most typically federal
agencies, can fund an entire survey module or add questions to an existing module if space permits.  SLAITS modules follow the NIS and are
procedurally noninvasive to and financially separate from all components of the NIS.  SLAITS uses the same sampling frame as the NIS, and
immediately follows the NIS in selected households, using its sample for efficiency and economy.  It supplements current national data
collection strategies by providing in-depth State and local area data to meet various program and policy needs in an ever-changing health care
system.
Since its inception, SLAITS has conducted a number of large and small surveys including the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) and the
National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) three times each, and the National Survey of Early Child Health (NSECH)
one time.  It is also possible to conduct follow-up or callback surveys of special populations identified during the initial SLAITS interview as
demonstrated by the National Survey of Adoptive Parents (NSAP), the National Asthma Survey (NAS), the Survey of Adult Transition and Health
(SATH), and the Survey of Pathways to Diagnosis and Services (Pathways) which is currently in the field.  Examples of add-ons to existing
surveys include detailed questions about experiences with Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program for uninsured children
living in low income households and the use of prescription medication and services for children with attention deficit hyperactive disorder.
Further information about SLAITS is available at: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/slaits.htm.  Offerors are expected to be familiar with the contents of
this website and with the documentation published by NCHS for the two largest SLAITS modules, the NSCH and NS-CSHCN, as it is likely that each
will be conducted during the course of this contract’s phases.   It is also likely that one or more follow-back surveys of household identified
during SLAITS interviews, similar to the National Survey of Adoptive Parents or the National Asthma Survey.  Recontact information is now being
collected at the end of all SLAITS interviews to facilitate follow-up surveys.

Operational methods research to improve the validity of survey estimates and effectiveness and efficiency of survey operations has been integral
to the NIS and SLAITS since their inception.  In recent years, declining willingness of the public to participate in surveys and changes in
household telephone use has resulted in declining response rates in the NIS and other surveys.  Of particular concern is the increasing
prevalence of households that have substituted their landline telephone for wireless service only.  Over 40% of households with children aged 19-
35 months may not be reachable by a landline survey.  Ongoing operational methods research is needed to evaluate the extent of this
undercoverage, its effect on the validity of NIS estimates, and viable approaches for including non-landline households in the NIS sample.

Other operational methods research has investigated the potential role of Immunization Information Systems (IIS) in the conduct of the NIS.  IIS
are confidential, population-based, computerized databases that record all immunization doses administered by participating providers to persons
residing within a given geopolitical area.  At the point of clinical care, an IIS can provide consolidated immunization histories for use by a
vaccination provider in determining appropriate client vaccinations.  At the population level, an IIS provides aggregate data on vaccinations
for use in surveillance and program operations and in guiding public health action with the goals of improving vaccination rates and reducing
vaccine-preventable disease.  IIS exist in most states, but vary in their level of child and provider participation and completeness of
vaccination histories.  With continued development of IIS and increased use of electronic medical record systems and their integration into IIS,
they may eventually replace the role of NIS in providing timely, valid and comparable estimates of vaccination coverage across state and local
areas.  In the shorter term, NIS and NIS-Teen samples have been matched to selected IIS to compare vaccination histories reported by both, and
the potential use of IIS as a dual sampling frame has also been evaluated.  The potential role of IIS to improve the efficiency of the NIS
provider record check is also being evaluated.

C.2  Project Objective
The NIS contract will obtain a contractor to conduct the NIS, SLAITS, and other related operational methods research tasks through issuance of
individual task orders.  The objective of the NIS is to produce annual and semiannual estimates of the proportion of noninstitutionalized
children 19 to 35 months (semiannual) and 13 to 17 years (annual) receiving vaccinations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP), in each of the nonoverlapping LSAs.  It is also intended to describe sociodemograpic disparities in vaccination coverage,
factors that influence the vaccination status of children, the uptake of newly recommended vaccines, and how information about immunization is
understood by the public.  The objective of SLAITS is to conduct health-related surveys using the NIS sampling frame and infrastructure as
needed.  The objective for other related research is to:  assess influenza vaccination utilization and related information during annual
influenza seasons; assess additional vaccination-related information from children or adults of any age in response to emerging program needs;
and improve efficiency, quality and validity of NIS and SLAITS.

C.3  Scope of Work
Project objectives will be achieved through issuance of firm fixed price or cost plus fixed fee task orders to conduct of survey activities that
are organized into the following subject areas:

 a. NIS Core.  Collection of vaccination data for children aged 19-35 months in each of at least 56 state and local areas of the United States.

 b. NIS-Teen.  Collection of vaccination data for adolescents aged 13-17 years using the same sample as the NIS, in each of at least 56 state and
    local areas of the United States.


 c. SLAITS.  Collection of health-related information for children of all ages, or adults, using the same sample as the NIS, possibly
    supplemented by additional sample as needed.  Followback surveys of SLAITS respondents are conducted to augment initial survey data, usually
    of special populations or persons with specific characteristics.


   d. Influenza Vaccination Surveys.  Collection of data related to influenza vaccination among persons of all ages.



   e. Optional Vaccination-related Modules.  Collection of additional vaccination-related data for children eligible for the NIS or NIS-Teen, or
      from other age groups of children or adults, using the same sample as the NIS, or using separate, stand-alone sampling frames.


 f. Operational Methods Research.  Evaluation, research and experiments to improve efficiency, quality and validity of NIS and SLAITS surveys.

C.4  Period of Performance
The period of performance for issuance of task orders against the IDIQ contract is a base period of one year and four one-year option periods.
Individual periods of performance will be specified per each task order.







C.5  Technical Requirements
 Task orders will be issued by either NCIRD or NCHS under the following general categories:

   a.  NIS Core.  Collection of vaccination data for children aged 19-35 months in each of at least 56 state and local areas of the United
      States.


      The NIS Core Task Orders will involve: 1) the design and conduct of quarterly/annual surveys to be fielded in each of the LSAs collecting
      data from the families of age-eligible children in RDD interviews for specified data years; 2) collecting data from the medical providers
      reported for those children (with oral consent from the parent or guardian); 3) combining the information from the responding providers and
      families to produce improved vaccination estimates comparable over time; 4) other data collections; 5) performing descriptive analyses of
      the data collected; 6) preparing computer files from edited survey data and reports documenting the files and the survey data collection
      methods and process results, and 7) performance monitoring and quality improvement efforts to assess and improve data quality and survey
      efficiency.


      A NIS data year refers to one calendar year, January 1 – December 31, during which quarterly samples of telephone numbers are dialed to
      identify households with age-eligible children and conduct NIS interviews.  Associated with each data year are approximately three prior
      months for planning (October – December),  12 months for household data collection, and approximately nine subsequent months to complete
      household interviews, complete follow-up of medical providers, prepare and deliver restricted access and public use data files, and final
      reports.  For example, NIS data year 2012 includes activities that would span from approximately October 2011 through September 2013.  NIS
      data year 2013 would span from approximately October 2012 through September 2014.  Thus, activities associated with separate Task Orders
      for consecutive NIS data years would overlap in their period of performance.


 b. NIS-Teen.  Collection of vaccination data for adolescents aged 13-17 years using the same sample as the NIS, in each of at least 56 state and
    local areas of the United States.  Survey procedures are generally similar to those required to conduct the core NIS.


 c. SLAITS.  Collection of health-related information for children of all ages, or adults, using the same sample as the NIS, possibly
    supplemented by additional sample as needed.  SLAITS surveys typically are conducted after screening and conducting interviews for NIS, NIS-
    Teen and other vaccination-related data collections.  Task orders in this category may include the National Survey of Children with Special
    Health Care Needs, the National Survey of Children’s Health, other large scale surveys similar to the aforementioned and smaller scale
    surveys or surveys that followback previous SLAITS households.  The scope and content of these surveys will be similar to their predecessors
    which can be viewed at  http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/slaits.htm

   d. Influenza Vaccination Surveys.  Collection of data related to influenza vaccination among persons of all ages.



      Task orders in this category may include influenza modules asked of children of any age identified during NIS screening, and general
      population surveys using an independent sample conducted continuously or periodically during the vaccination period, typically during
      October through June. CDC may use this contract for annual monitoring of influenza vaccination, with expanded approaches implemented as
      needed in emergent situations (e.g., pandemic influenza, shortage of influenza vaccine).




   e. Optional Vaccination-related Modules.  Collection of additional vaccination-related data for children eligible for the NIS or NIS-Teen, or
      from other age groups of children or adults, using the same sample as the NIS, or using separate, stand-alone sampling frames.


      Short (e.g., 5-10 minute) survey modules may be added to the end of the NIS or NIS-Teen survey to collect additional vaccination related
      information (e.g., parental attitudes toward childhood vaccination).  Task orders in this category may also include vaccination-related
      surveys using the NIS sampling frame, or separate, standalone sampling frames, to obtain parental information regarding vaccination of
      children of any age, or to obtain information from persons ≥18 years about their own vaccination-related behavior.


 f. Operational Methods Research Tasks.  Evaluation, research and experiments to improve efficiency, quality and validity of NIS and SLAITS
    surveys.
      Task orders in this category may include experiments to test modifications of survey instruments or procedures, conducting provider record
      check for respondents from the National Health Interview Survey, designing more efficient and valid dual frame telephone samples,
      experimentation with address-based sample frames, and matching of NIS and NIS-Teen samples with Immunization Information Systems (IIS).

               In general, the contractor’s responsibilities include such activities as:
      Questionnaire design and testing;
      Survey instrument modification if necessary and approved by CDC;
      Sampling plan, design, and selection;
      Preparation of the survey questionnaire(s) and other necessary data collection materials;
      Recruitment, training and performance monitoring of interviewers;
      Administration of telephone,  mail surveys, and web surveys for providers;
      Development of weighting procedures and implementation of estimators;
      Design and implementation of quality control procedures;
      Conversion of data on paper forms into electronic form;
      Preparation of field and methodological reports;
      Preparation of verified, edited, and documented data files and data user’s guide (in an electronic format acceptable to the  Contracting
        Officer’s Technical Representative {COTR});
      Methodological Studies; and
      Other activities essential for the successful completion of the project.

C.6  Place of Performance – Services will be performed at vendor specified site in the United States.  All aspects of work related to this
contract must be performed in the U. S., this includes work performed by the Contractor and any sub-contractors.   For individual task orders,
some work may be conducted in the U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions (e.g., United States Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico) at the specific request
of the COTR.

C.7  Reporting Schedule – Contractor reporting requirements will be defined in each individual task order.  Reports may include weekly, monthly,
or quarterly reports, along with a final report.

C.8  Travel – Any required travel will be identified on individual task orders as necessary.  The Contractor shall coordinate all travel
requirements with the CDC Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) and obtain written approval from the Contracting Officer prior
to beginning such travel.


Government will reimburse the Contractor for travel related costs.  The Contractor shall submit receipts for airfare, lodging, car rentals, and
other incidental travel-related expenses.  Travel costs shall not exceed the maximum per diem rates set forth in the Federal Travel Regulation
(FTR).  The FTR per diem rates and regulations can be found at the following website:
http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/channelView.do?pageTypeId=17113&channelPage=%2Fep%2Fchannel%2FgsaOverview.jsp&channelId=-24564


C.9  Training - The Contractor, at its own expense, shall perform training for their professional staff associated with required competencies
for each task.  The Government will fund the Contractor to provide orientation and training on specific department, unit, site, programs or
education requirements, policies, and procedures peculiar to the work to be performed by the Contractor and unique to CDC operations if required
for specific tasks and approved in advance by the Contracting Officer and the COTR.  The Government will not authorize training for Contractor
employees to attend seminars, symposiums, or user group conferences unless determined that attendance is mandatory for the performance of task
requirements and such training is approved in advance by the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor shall assume full responsibility for keeping
Contractor professional employees abreast of advances in state-of-the-art technologies.


C.10  Special Considerations – These shall be specified as applicable on an individual task order basis:

      a.) For any work to be performed in the U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions (mainly Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands), the Contractor
      shall be in compliance with laws that govern employment in any of these  U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions if the need arises to utilize
      contract staff in any capacity within a given jurisdictions.


      The Contractor  is responsible for obtaining all necessary information on laws that pertain to employment  in each of the U.S.-affiliated
      jurisdictions in the event contract personnel is sent to the local area from the U.S., or if local individuals are contracted to assist
      with any field work.


          b.) In the event contract personnel are sent to U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions and vaccines are needed,
               acquisition of licensed vaccines will be the responsibility of    the contract vendor.

      c.) The Contractor shall employ management practices that ensure all requirements are fulfilled in a technically compliant and timely
      manner, and employee time is tracked.

      d.) The Contractor shall implement management systems and controls for recording and monitoring workloads for all tasks.  This system shall
      include a means for acquiring signed time cards to be submitted with invoices for T&M/Labor Hour task orders. The systems shall be capable
      of providing historical and in-process workload data segregated by task order.

      e.) The Contractor and Contractor employees shall conduct only business covered by this contract during periods paid for by this contract
      and shall not conduct any other business for any other project(s) while paid for by this contract.  This includes other Government projects
      and non- Government projects not paid for by this contract.

      f.) If the Contractor personnel must speak and read in a language other than English, or have other required skills, the Government will
      state those requirements in the task order request and subsequent task order.

           g.) Transition and Succession:
      The Contractor shall have a transition and succession plan that demonstrates the capability to ensure a
      smooth transition with current contracts and/or successor contracts with a minimum of disruption to
      customer services. Specific task order    transition issues will be addressed in individual task orders.


      The Contractor may also be expected to work with the follow-on Contractors to ensure a smooth transition. Within 10 calendar  days  of  the
      award of any successor task order or contract, the Contractor will be required to meet with CDC COTR and the new Contractor to discuss  and
      identify any outstanding transition issues.  CDC will be responsible for the costs of this transition period.

          h.)  Section 508:
               Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment
               Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and
               Information (EIT) Accessibility provisions (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies,
               all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or
               agency permit:


      (1) Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of
      information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and


      (2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information
      and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with
      disabilities.


     i. Any or all data and programs developed to administer surveys, edit data, weight data, and any other documentation that might be needed
        to replicate procedures produced from this project with Federal fund becomes the property of the Government.  The Government maintains
        the rights and all decisions about the use of the non-public use data for presentations at meetings, conferences and any publications
        (this would include academic, technical or professional journals).




          j.)   Any plans by the contractor to use any or all data and programs developed to administer surveys, edit                 data,
  weight data, and any other documentation that might be needed to replicate procedures produced

                  by this project must obtain permission from the COTR in writing. In addition, Assessment Branch

                  clearance is required for presentations and publications after permission is granted. The request must

                  clearly describe the plans for using the data.

      k.)   The Contractor and Contractor employees shall collect and process data utilizing nondisclosure and
              confidentiality practices and guidance as outlined by the NCHS.


      l.)   Additional special considerations may be specified on an individual task order basis.

G.2  Evaluation of Contractor Performance (Service) (Jan 2000)

(a)  Purpose

In accordance with FAR 42.1502, the Contractor's performance will be periodically evaluated by the Government, in order to provide current
information for source selection purposes.  These evaluations will therefore be marked “Source Selection Information.”

(b)  Performance Evaluation Period

The Contractor's performance will be evaluated at least annually.

(c)  Evaluators

The performance evaluation will be completed jointly by the Contracting Officer Technical Representative and the Contracting officer.

(d)  Performance Evaluation Factors

The contractor's performance will be evaluated in accordance with the attachment listed in Section J, Attachment J.6, titled Contractor
Performance Report.

submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information to the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days after receipt of the
evaluation.





(f)  Resolving Disagreements Between the Government and the Contractor

Disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation will be reviewed at a level above the Contracting Officer.  The ultimate conclusion
on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency.  Copies of the evaluation, contractor's response, and review comments, if
any, will be retained as part of the evaluation.

(g)  Release of Contractor Performance Evaluation Information

The completed evaluation will not be released to other than Government personnel and the contractor whose performance is being evaluated.
Disclosure of such information could cause harm both to the commercial interest of the Government and to the competitive position of the
contractor being evaluated as well as impede the efficiency of Government operations.

award decisions.  The information may be provided through interview and/or by sending the evaluation and comment document to the requesting
source selection official.

(i)  Retention Period

The agency will retain past performance information for a maximum period of three years after completion of contract performance for the purpose
of providing source selection information for future contract awards.

G.3  Payment (Performance-Based Services) (Jul 1999)

(a)   General

It is the objective of the Government to obtain complete and satisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of the specifications and
requirements of this contract.  The procedures set forth in the clause entitled Criteria for Deductions will be used by the Government in
determining monetary deductions for nonperformance of work under this contract, or for deficiencies in the performance of work, and supplements
the Inspection of Services clause contained in Section E of this contract.

(b)  Adjusting Payments

(1) Under the Inspection of Services clause of this contract, payments may be adjusted if any service does not conform with contract
requirements.  The Contracting Officer or a designated representative will inform the Contractor, in writing, of the type and dollar amount of
proposed deductions by the l0th workday of the month following the performance period for which the deductions are to be made.

(2)  The Contractor may, within 10 working days of receipt of the notification of the proposed deduction, present to the Contracting officer
specific reasons why any or all of the proposed deductions are not justified.  Reasons must be solidly based and must provide specific facts
that justify reconsideration and/or adjustment of the amount to be deducted.  Failure to respond within the 10 day period will be interpreted to
mean that the Contractor accepts the deductions proposed.

(3)  All or a portion of the final payment may be delayed or withheld until the Contracting Officer makes a final decision on the proposed
deduction.  If the Contracting Officer determines that any or all of the proposed deductions are warranted, the Contracting officer shall so
notify the Contractor, and adjust payments under the contract accordingly.

                                                                 (End of Clause)

G.4  Reimbursement of Cost (Apr 2000)

Clauses. Examples of allowable costs include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) All direct materials and supplies which are used in the performing of the work provided for under the contract, including those purchased
for subcontracts and purchase orders.

(2) All direct labor, including supervisory , that is properly chargeable directly to the contract, plus fringe benefits.

(3) All other items of cost budgeted for and accepted in the negotiation of this basic contract or modifications thereto.

(4) Special expenditures which, upon request from the Contractor, the Contracting Officer approves as being an allowable cost under this
contract, such as purchase or lease of office furniture or equipment, etc..

(5) All travel costs plus per diem or actual subsistence for personnel while in an actual travel status in direct performance of the work and
services required under this contract. These costs will be in accordance with the Contractor’s policy and subject to the following:

(i) Air travel shall be by the most direct route using “air coach” or “air tourist” (less than first class) unless it is clearly unreasonable or
impractical (e.g., not available for reasons other than avoidable delay in making reservations, would require circuitous routing or entail
additional expense offsetting the savings on fare, or would not make necessary connections).

(ii) Rail travel shall be by the most direct route, first class with lower berth or nearest equivalent.

(iii) Costs incurred for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses shall be considered reasonable and allowable to the extent that they do not
exceed on a daily basis the per diem rates set forth in the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR).

(iv) Travel via privately owned automobile shall be reimbursed at not more than the current General Services Administration (GSA) FTR
established mileage rate.

(b) Except as stated herein, the Contractor shall not incur costs unless the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer has been
obtained.  When costs are incurred without such prior authorization, with the intent of claiming reimbursement as direct costs, it shall be at
the contractor’s risk.

                                                                 (End of Clause)

G.9  CDC0-G008 Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) Technical Guidance (Sep 2009)

Performance of the work hereunder shall be subject to the technical directions of the designated COTR for this contract.

As used herein, technical directions are directions to the Contractor which fill in details, suggests possible lines of inquiry, or otherwise
completes the general scope of work set forth herein. These technical directions must be within the general scope of work, and may not alter the
scope of work or cause changes of such a nature as to justify an adjustment in the stated contract price/cost, or any stated limitation thereof.
In the event that the Contractor feels that full implementation of any of these directions may exceed the scope of the contract, he or she shall
notify the originator of the technical direction and the Contracting Officer in a letter separate of any required report(s) within two (2) weeks
of the date of receipt of the technical direction and no action shall be taken pursuant to the direction.  If the Contractor fails to provide
the required notification within the said two (2) week period that any technical direction exceeds the scope of the contract, then it shall be
deemed for purposes of this contract that the technical direction was within the scope. No technical direction, nor its fulfillment, shall alter
or abrogate the rights and obligations fixed in this contract.

              Billing Instructions for Negotiated Cost-Type Contracts
                                                    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Introduction
Reimbursement procedures related to negotiated cost-type contracts require that Contractors submit to the Government adequately prepared  claims.
The instructions that follow are  provided  for  Contractors’  use  in  the  preparation  and  submission  of  invoices  or  vouchers  requesting
reimbursement for work performed. The preparation of invoices or vouchers as outlined below will aid in the review and  approval  of  claims  and
enable prompt payment to the Contractor.

1. Forms to Be Used

In requesting reimbursement, Contractors may use the regular Government voucher form, Standard Form  1034,  “Public  Voucher  for  Purchases  and
Services Other Than Personal,” and Standard Form 1035, “Continuation Sheet,” or the Contractor’s own invoice form. If the Contractor  desires  to
use the Government’s standard forms, a request for the forms should be submitted to the Contracting Officer.  If  the  Contractor  uses  his  own
invoice, the billing must conform with the instructions set forth herein.


Submission of Invoices or Vouchers

Invoices or vouchers shall be submitted per Section G of the contract.  All original invoices or vouchers must  be  submitted  to  the  Financial
Management Office at the address show below:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Financial Management Office (FMO)
P.O. Box 15580
Atlanta, GA  30333

Or – The Contractor may submit the original invoice/voucher or progress payment via facsimile or email:

Fax:  404-638-5324

Email:  FMOAPINV@CDC.GOV

NOTE:  Submit to only one (1) of the above locations.


In addition, the contractor shall submit 2 copies of the invoice/voucher or progress payment to the cognizant contracting office previously
identified in this contract.  These invoices/voucher copies shall be addressed to the attention of the Contracting Officer.


REMINDER: The original and each copy should be easily identifiable. Vouchers should be collated. Failure to submit vouchers in the proper  format
will delay your payment.


3.   Preparation of Invoices or Vouchers

a.  EXHIBIT I – Summary of All Costs

As shown on the attached Standard Form 1034, identified as EXHIBIT I (SAMPLE), a summary of  all  current  costs  must  be  shown.  This  summary
consists of a list identifying the general categories and the amounts incurred during the period  covered  by  the  billing,  together  with  the
portion of fixed fee (if any) payable for that period. The reimbursable costs incurred and the dates of the period  for  which  the  charges  are
claimed must fall within the period specified in the contract.

b.  EXHIBIT II – Details of Costs Claimed

As shown on the attached Standard Form 1035, identified as EXHIBIT II (SAMPLE), a  detailed  breakdown  must  be  provided  to  substantiate  the
categories shown on the summary of costs (see EXHIBIT I). The following describes some of the categories that might appear on your billings:

 (1)   Direct Labor

Direct Labor costs consist of salaries and wages paid for scientific, technical, and other work performed directly for the contract and  pursuant
to the contract terms. Labor costs, excluding fringe benefits and overtime premium pay, will be billed as follows:

List the titles and amounts for employees whose salaries or wages, or portions thereof, were charged to the contract; show the  rate  (or  hours)
worked, and amount for each individual. The cost of direct labor, which is charged directly to the contract, must be supported  by  time  records
maintained in the contractor’s office.

(2) Fringe Benefits

If it is the Contractor’s established practice to treat fringe benefits as a direct cost, such costs should be  billed  separately  as  a  single
item.

NOTE: Fringe benefits, bonuses, etc., are usually treated as indirect costs for inclusion in the overhead pool; however, they may be  treated  as
direct labor costs or as an “Other Direct Charge” if such treatment is in accordance with the Contractor’s established accounting procedures.

(3) Premium Pay

Premium pay is the difference between the rates and amounts paid for overtime or shift work and amount normally paid on a  straight  time  basis.
Generally such pay is not included in the direct labor base and should not be included in the billing for “direct labor”  unless  the  Contractor
has consistently followed this practice in the past as a matter of policy. Premium pay of any kind unless provided for in the  contract  must  be
authorized by the Contracting Officer in advance. Billings for  unauthorized  premium  pays  have  caused  frequent  delays  in  payment  due  to
suspensions and exchange of correspondence. Citations of authorization for premium pay will avoid delays in payment. Authorized premium  pay  may
be shown as a single item on the summary of costs. However, it must be separately itemized for  each  position,  or  job  category,  showing  the
amount, and a citation of the Contracting Officer’s letter of authorization on the continuation sheet of the invoice or voucher.

(4) Materials and Supplies

Only those items, which the Contractor normally treats as “direct costs”,  should  be  claimed  under  this  heading.  Major  classifications  of
material only should be billed separately under appropriate classification. Items  costing  less  than  $25.00  may  be  listed  by  category  of
materials or supplies. Show the description and dollar amount  of  individual  classifications.  All  such  charges  must  be  supported  by  the
Contractor’s office records.

 (5)   Travel

When authorized in the contract as a direct cost, travel costs that are directly related to specific contract performance  may  be  billed  as  a
direct cost. Travel cost detail should show:

    (a)    Name of traveler and official title,

    (b)    Purpose of trip,

   (c) Dates of departure and return to starting point (station or airport),

   (d) Transportation costs, identified as to rail, air, private automobile (including mileage and rate) and taxi.

   (e) If claim for subsistence is on per diem basis, show number of days, rate and amount, as authorized in contract.[1] If claim  is  based  on
   actual cost of subsistence, show, on a daily basis, the amounts claimed for lodging and meals separately.

     f) Reference to Contracting Officer’s letter of authorization if required by contract.

    (6)    Consultant Fees
Identify the consultant by name, number of days utilized, and amount of fee.
(7) Equipment
Nonexpendable personal property must be specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer or authorized by the terms of  the  contract.
Billing data should include a description of item, make model, quantity, unit cost, total cost, and date approved by the Contracting Officer,  if
applicable. A copy of the vendor’s bill may be submitted in lieu of the identifying information.
(8) Burden
Pending establishment of final contract indirect cost rates for each of the Contractor’s fiscal years, the Contractor will  be  reimbursed  based
on his submittal of provisional rates as set forth in the contract. The contract may provide for more than one type indirect cost rate,  such  as
overhead rate, and general and administrative expense rate, in which case the direct cost bases (e.g., direct labor, total direct cost, etc.)
(9) Fixed Fee
Ordinarily the fixed fee is stated in the contract as a lump sum and may be billed in the ratio of incurred costs to total estimated cost as  set
forth in the contract, with the final 15 percent to be billed on the final invoice or voucher. Contract terms govern the method of payments.
c.  EXHIBIT III – Cumulative Amount Claimed
As shown on the attached Standard Form 1035, identified as EXHIBIT III (SAMPLE), the Contractor must  show  the  cumulative  amounts  claimed  by
categories from the contract award date through the date of the current invoice or voucher, as  well  as  the  estimated  cost  to  complete  per
category.

QUICK CHECKLIST FOR INVOICE SUBMISSION:
    • Standard Forms 1034 and 1035 recommended. If submitting own forms, statement must conform to billing instructions
    • Quarterly billing as a minimum
    • Invoice or Voucher contain the minimum requirements per Invoice Submission clause per Section G of the contract

    • Detail of Cost Claimed






   G.14    Task Orders



      Task orders are officially awarded by the Contracting Officer that commission work for a specific CDC organization for a defined function
      or purpose.  Task orders can have one or more deliverable products or recurring services required.  Task orders specify and authorize work
      to be accomplished by the Contractor to satisfy the Government’s requirements.  They specify the scope of work, schedule for completion,
      technical requirements, deliverable product(s) and/or services, performance standards, acceptance criteria for deliverable products and/or
      services, and the total price/cost of the work/service to be performed.  Task orders can be issued for severable and non-severable services
      which will be specified in the RFTOPs.   Subsequent work orders can be issued under the task order to further specify the nature of the
      work, instructions to follow, deliverables to produce, etc.


      Contracting Officers Technical Representatives are officials of the organization requiring the work who are responsible at the task order
      level for technical oversight of the work.  Contracting Officer’s Technical Representatives may designate Technical Contacts within their
      organizations to provide the Contractor with additional technical contact points for day-to-day technical guidance, problem solving and
      liaison.  Neither Contracting Officer’s Technical Representatives nor Technical Contacts are authorized to make any changes to task orders
      or waive any contract requirements.


                                                                 (End of Clause)



G.15   Ordering

      It is CDC’s goal to clearly and unambiguously state the nature and extent of the work to be done in the Task Order through a Statement of
      Work (SOW) specified in the Request For Task Order Proposals (RFTOP).  When the work is inherently unclear or uncertain initially, the work
      may need to be divided into sequential task orders each aimed at achieving clear and unambiguous outcomes for the subsequent work.


      CDC will cover the following essential elements in each Task Order SOW:

        (1) Desired data and information outputs;
        (2) Access control or security requirements;
        (3) Additional Government standards that are applicable beyond those specified in this contract; and
        (4) Anticipated travel.

                                                                 (End of Clause)

Officer Technical Representative.

                                                                 (End of Clause)


H.2  Release of Information (Jul 1999)

The Contractor shall not, unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer, release or provide any information or interpretations
concerning any plans or specifications prepared under this contract to prospective construction contractors, manufacturers, or suppliers for
their use in bidding or submitting quotations on the subject project.

Any cost estimates prepared by the Contractor under this contract for use either by the Government or the Contractor shall be consider
privileged information and will not be divulged to any third party.

                                                                 (End of Clause)


H.3  CDC0-H021  Lobbying Prohibition Using Federal Funds (Sep 2009)

Per FAR 31.205-22, the contractor is hereby notified of the restrictions on the use of Department of Health and Human Service's funding for
lobbying of Federal, State and Local legislative bodies.

Section 1352 of Title 10, United Stated Code (Public Law 101-121, effective 12/23/89), among other things, prohibits a recipient (and their
subcontractors) of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement from using appropriated funds (other than profits from a federal
contract) to pay any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or
employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with any of the following covered Federal actions; the awarding of
any Federal contract; the making of any Federal grant; the making of any Federal loan; the entering into of any cooperative agreement; or the
modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.  For additional information of prohibitions against lobbying
activities, see FAR Subpart 3.8 and FAR Clause 52.203-12.

In addition, the current Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act provides that no part of any appropriation contained in this
Act shall be used, other than for normal and recognized executive-legislative relationships, for publicity or propaganda purposes, for the
preparation, distribution, or use of any kit, pamphlet, booklet, publication, radio, television, or video presentation designed to support, or
defeat legislation pending before the Congress, or any State or Local legislature except in presentation to the Congress, or any State or Local
legislative body itself.

The current Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act also provides that no part of any appropriation contained in this Act
shall be used to pay the salary or expenses of any contract or grant recipient, or agent acting for such recipient, related to any activity
designed to influence legislation or appropriations pending before the Congress, or any State or Local legislature.

                                                                 (End of Clause)




H.4  CDC0-H022  Smoke Free Working Environment (May 2009)

In compliance with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations, all contractor personnel performing work within CDC/ATSDR
facilities shall observe the CDC/ATSDR smoke-free working environment policy at all times. This policy prohibits smoking in all CDC/ATSDR
buildings and in front of buildings which are open to the public. This policy is also applicable to contractor personnel who do not work full-
time within CDC/ATSDR facilities, but are attending meetings within CDC/ATSDR facilities.

                                                                 (End of Clause)


H.5   CDC0-H055:  Smoke Free Environment Certification (February 2009)

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes that secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure poses serious health risks to nonsmokers.
SHS exposure in the workplace has been linked to an increased risk for heart disease and lung cancer among adult nonsmokers. SHS has been
designated as a known carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) by the National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and by
the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has concluded that SHS is an
occupational carcinogen. There is no risk-free level of SHS exposure. Separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating
buildings cannot eliminate this exposure.  SHS is an important preventable cause of death from cancer and other illnesses, and many Americans,
both adults and children, remain at significant risk from SHS exposure.

It is the CDC’s intent to protect the health of all CDC employees and reduce cancer and other serious health hazards caused by SHS exposure.
Therefore, all meetings and conferences organized and/or sponsored or co-sponsored by the CDC shall be held in a conference venue that provides
a smoke-free environment. A smoke-free conference venue is defined as a venue that makes ALL public places in the hotel and in all meeting
facilities smoke-free.  This includes, but is not limited to, meeting rooms, common areas such as lobbies and hallways, all indoor public
spaces, all indoor employee work areas, restaurants (including restaurant bar areas), and lounges.

Conferences include symposia, seminars, workshops, and any other organized and formal meeting lasting one or more days, where CDC personnel
assemble to exchange information and views or explore or clarify a defined subject, problem, or area of knowledge.

CERTIFICATION: Offeror’s acceptance of any resulting contract certifies that the meeting/conference venue provided is “smoke-free” and that all
CDC personnel attending said meeting/conference will be doing so in a smoke-free environment.

                                                                 (End of Clause)


H.6  CDC0-H045  Privacy Act (Sep 2009)

(a)  Notification is hereby given that the Contractor and its employees are subject to criminal penalties for violation of the Privacy Act to
the same extent as employees of the Government. The Contractor shall assure that each of its employees knows the prescribed rules of conduct and
that each is aware that he or she can be subjected to criminal penalty for violation of the Act. A copy of 45 CFR Part 5b, Privacy Act
Regulations, may be obtained at http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&tpl=%2Findex.tpl.

(b)  The Contracting Officer Technical Representative is hereby designated as the official who is responsible for monitoring contractor
compliance with the Privacy Act.

(c)  The Contractor shall follow the Privacy Act guidance as contained in the Privacy Act system notice provided in individual task orders, as
applicable.

                                                                 (End of Clause)
H.7  System of Records (SOR) Notice

Contractors shall abide by all requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974.  Pursuant to those requirements, the contractor shall work with the
OPDIV system owner or designee and the OPDIV Privacy Act Officer to publish a System of Record (SOR) notice in the Federal Register when a new
System of Records is to be created and will publish an updated SOR notice following a “major change” as defined by Office of Management and
Budget Memorandum 03-22 or subsequent replacement guidance.
                                                                (End of Provision)

H.8  Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)

Contractors shall conduct and maintain an initial Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) as defined by Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002.
Periodic reviews shall be conducted by the system owner, with assistance from the contractor, to determine if a major change to the system has
occurred, and if a PIA update is needed.
                                                                (End of provision)

H.9  Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractor and Contractor Employees (May 2009)
The Contractor shall prepare and submit a Designated Agent Agreement to the Contracting Officer and COTR prior to accessing confidential
information.  Instructions are provided in Attachment “Affidavit of Non-Disclosure” (see Section J – J.12).

I. Procurement-Sensitive Information
 
Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner
or to any extent, to any individual, other than an authorized Government employee, any procurement-sensitive information gained while in
connection with fulfilling the employee’s responsibilities at the CDC. For purposes of this agreement, procurement-sensitive information
includes, but is not limited to, all information in Statements of Work (SOW), Requests for Contract (RFC), and Requests for Proposal (RFP);
Responses to RFPs, including questions from potential offerors; non-public information regarding procurements; all documents, conversations,
discussions, data, correspondence, electronic mail (e-mail), presentations, or any other written or verbal communications relating to,
concerning, or affecting proposed or pending solicitations or awards; procurement data; contract information plans; strategies; source selection
information and documentation; offerors’ identities; technical and cost data; the identity of government personal involved in the solicitation;
the schedule of key technical and procurement events in the award determination process; and any other information that may provide an unfair
competitive advantage to a contractor or potential contractor if improperly disclosed to them, or any of their employees.
 
Contractor understands and agrees that employee access to any procurement-sensitive information may create a conflict of interest which will
preclude contractor from becoming a competitor for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information. Therefore, if an employee participates in
any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assists in developing any procurement-sensitive information, or otherwise obtains
any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing duties at the CDC, contractor understands and agrees that contractor are
be excluded from competing for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information.


II.    Identification of Non-Government Employees
 
Contractor understands that its employees are not agents of the Government. Therefore, unless otherwise directed in writing by the CDC,
contractor agrees to assist and monitor employee compliance with the following identification procedures:



 
        A.   At the beginning of interactions with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities,
               members of the public, or the media (when such communication or interaction relates to the contractor’s work with the CDC),
           contractors’ employees will identify themselves as an employee of a contractor.
        B.   Contractors’ employees will include the following disclosures in all written communications,
               including outgoing electronic mail (e-mail) messages, in connection with contractual duties to the CDC:
                 Employee’s name
                 Name of contractor
                 Center or office affiliation
                 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention


        C.     At the beginning of telephone conversations or conference calls, contractors’ employees will
                 identify themselves as an employee of a contractor.
        D.     Contractors should not wear any CDC logo on clothing, except for a CDC issued security badge
                 while carrying out work for CDC or on CDC premises. The only other exception is when a CDC
                 management official has granted permission to use the CDC logo.
        E.     Contractors’ employees will program CDC voice mail message to identify themselves as an
                 employee of a contractor.
            
I understand that federal laws including, 18 U.S.C. 641 and 18 U.S.C. 2071, provide criminal penalties for, among other things, unlawfully
removing, destroying or converting to personal use, or use of another, any public records. Contractor acknowledges that contractor has read and

I. Procurement-Sensitive Information

or to any extent, to any individual other than an authorized Government employee, any procurement-sensitive information gained in connection
with the performance of my responsibilities to the CDC. I specifically agree not to disclose any non-public, procurement-sensitive information

strategies; source selection information and documentation; offerors’ identities; technical and cost data; the identity of government personal
involved in the acquisition; the schedule of key technical and procurement events in the award determination process; and any other information
that may provide an unfair competitive advantage to a contractor or potential contractor if improperly disclosed to them, or any of their
employees.

 
Contractor understand and agrees that my access to any procurement-sensitive information may create a conflict of interest which will preclude
me, my current employer, or a future employer from becoming a competitor for any resulting government acquisition derived from this information.
Therefore, if I participate in any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assist in developing any procurement-sensitive
information, or otherwise obtain any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing my duties at the CDC, I understand and
agree that I, my current employer, and any future employer(s) are excluded from competing for any resulting acquisitions.

II. Special Non-Disclosure Clause for Contractors with Access to CDC Grants Management and Procurement-Related Information Technology Systems
 
In addition to complying with the non-disclosure requirements and safeguards stated above, I understand that my authorization to use CDC’s
grants management and procurement systems is strictly limited to the access and functions necessary for the performance of my responsibilities
to the CDC and which have been approved in advance by the CDC. I understand that I am not authorized to enter procurement requests for any
requirements pertaining to contracts or subcontracts held by me or my employer.
 
III.    Identification as a Non-Government Employee
 
I understand that as an employee of a government contractor, I represent an independent organization and I am not an agent of the Government.
Therefore, I agree that unless I have prior written authorization from the CDC, I will, at the beginning of interactions with CDC employees,
employees of other governmental entities, members of the public, or the media (when such communication or interaction relates to the
contractor’s work with the CDC), identify myself as an employee of a contractor. I further agree to use the following identification procedures
in connection with my work at the CDC:
  
A. I will include the following disclosures in all written communications, including outgoing electronic mail (e-mail) messages:
                 Employee’s name
                 Name of contractor
                 Center or office Affiliation
                 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                  
B. I will identify myself as an employee of a contractor at the beginning of telephone conversations or conference calls;

C. I will not wear any CDC logo on clothing, except for a CDC issued security badge while carrying out work for CDC or on CDC premises; the only
other exception is when a CDC management official has granted permission to use the CDC logo.

D. I will program my CDC voice mail message to identify myself as a contractors’ employee.
 
I understand that federal laws including, 18 U.S.C. 641 and 18 U.S.C. 2071, provide criminal penalties for, among other things, unlawfully
removing, destroying or converting to personal use, or use of another, any public records. I acknowledge that I have read and fully understand
this agreement.

I.2  FAR 52.216-18 Ordering (Oct 1995)

individuals or activities designated in the Schedule. Such orders may be issued from date of award  through the end of the contract period.

(b) All delivery orders or task orders are subject to the terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of conflict between a delivery
order or task order and this contract, the contract shall control.

(c) If mailed, a delivery order or task order is considered “issued” when the Government deposits the order in the mail. Orders may be issued
orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods only if authorized in the Schedule.

                                                                 (End of Clause)



I.3  FAR 52.216-19 Order Limitations (Oct 1995)

(a) Minimum order. When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than $00.00, the Government

(b) Maximum order - $190 million

(1) Any order for a single item in excess of $190 million;

(2) Any order for a combination of items in excess of $190 million; or

(3) A series of orders from the same ordering office within five (5) days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation in
subparagraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.

(c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order
limitations in paragraph (b) of this section.

(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in
paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within five (5) days after issuance, with written notice stating
the Contractor’s intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons. Upon receiving this notice, the Government may acquire the
supplies or services from another source.

                                                                 (End of Clause)

quantities of supplies and services specified in the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract.

(b) Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause. The Contractor shall
furnish to the Government, when and if ordered, the supplies or services specified in the Schedule up to and including the quantity designated
in the Schedule as the “maximum.” The Government shall order at least the quantity of supplies or services designated in the Schedule as the
“minimum.”

(c) Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order Limitations clause or in the Schedule, there is no limit on the number of orders that
may be issued. The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations.

(d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the Contractor
within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern the Contractor’s and Government’s rights and obligations with respect to that
order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract’s effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be
required to make any deliveries under this contract after twelve (12) months after the end date of the contract.

                                                                 (End of Clause)



I.5  FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)

The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may

52.252-3             Alterations in Solicitation (Apr 1984)


L.2  FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition (Jan 2004)

(a) Definitions. As used in this provision –

“Discussions” are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer’s discretion, result
in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.”

“In writing,” “writing,” or “written” means any worded or numbered expression which can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and
includes electronically transmitted and stored information.

“Proposal modification” is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation’s closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or
made to correct a mistake at any time before award.

“Proposal revision” is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer
as the result of negotiations.

“Time,” if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and
legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day.

(b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall
acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s).

(c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.

(1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals
shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages

(i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and

(ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using
commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and
(c)(1)(ii) of this provision.

(2) The first page of the proposal must show –

(i) The solicitation number;

(ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available);

(iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to
furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item;

(iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the
offeror’s behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and

(v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal. Proposals signed by an agent shall be accompanied by evidence of that
agent’s authority, unless that evidence has been previously furnished to the issuing office.

(3) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.

(i) Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modification, or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in
the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m.,
local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due.

(ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified
for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that
accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and –

(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to
the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or

(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under
the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

(3) It is the only proposal received.

(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered
at any time it is received and may be accepted.

(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on
the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.

(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated
for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on
the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be
withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before
award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror
or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the
proposal before award.

(4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items.

(5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S.
dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

(6) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications
in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.

(7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer.

(8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer.

(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover
sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror).

(e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for
any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall –

(1) Mark the title page with the following legend:

This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed – in whole or in
part – for for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of – or in
connection with – the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent
provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in this data if it is
obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other
identification of sheets]; and

(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:

Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.

(f) Contract award.

(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s)
represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.

(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.

(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in
FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.
The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting
Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient
competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that
will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices
offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.

(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the
Government’s best interest to do so.

(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline
items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is
significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the
Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.

(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or
schedule risk.

(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal
shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:

(i) The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer.
(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on
the debriefed offeror.
(iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the
solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

                                                                (End of Provision)






L.3  FAR 52.233-2 Service of Protest (Sep 2006)

(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any
protests that are filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by
obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Attn:  Nancy M. Norton
2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3000
Mailstop: K14
Atlanta, Ga  30341-5539

(b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO.

                                                                (End of provision)


L.4  Past Performance Information (Jan 2000)

1. Offerors shall submit the following information as part of their business proposal for both the Offeror and proposed major subcontractors:

2. The Offeror shall provide a list of the last three (3) contracts completed during the past three years and the last (3) contracts awarded
currently in progress that are similar in nature to the solicitation work scope. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal
Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts
should list contracts as required above for all key personnel:

a. Name of Contracting Organization
b. Contract Number
c. Total Contract Value
d. Description of Requirement
e. Contract Officer's name and telephone number
f. Program Manager's name and telephone number

3. Each Offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance
information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which the Offerors relative rankings will be
compared to assure the best value to the Government. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative
to the size and complexity of the acquisition under consideration. The government is not required to contact all references provided by the
Offeror, and references other than those identified by the Offeror may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will
be considered in the evaluation of the Offeror’s past performance.

4. An evaluation of Offeror's past performance information will be conducted subsequent to the technical evaluation.  However, this evaluation
will not be conducted on any Offeror whose proposal would not be selected for award based on the results of the evaluation of factors other than
past performance.

5. The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Offeror, other relevant past performance information
obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the Offeror concerning problems encountered on the
identified contracts and corrective action taken.

The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each Offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an Offeror's likelihood
of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that Offeror's record of past performance.

The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an Offeror's performance on a
list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information.

When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the Offeror as it relates to all acquisition
requirements, such as the Offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the Offeror's
record of controlling and forecasting costs; the Offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance;
the Offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror's business-
like concern for the interest of the customer.

The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends
in the Offeror's performance.

The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor
disadvantage of the Offeror.


L.5  Inquiries (May 1998)

    (a)    Inquiries concerning the solicitation document should be submitted in writing to the issuing office.  Any additions, deletions, or
changes to the solicitation will be made by an amendment.  OFFERORS ARE INSTRUCTED SPECIFICALLY TO CONTACT ONLY THE SOLICITATION CONTRACTING

DOCUMENT SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE.  Inquiries should be received at the Contracting Office no later than September 6, 2011,
via e-mail to afx2@cdc.gov.

    (b)    Email is the preferred method for submitting inquiries.  To ensure timely and accurate processing of inquiries, offerors are
instructed to put “Questions for RFP 2011-N-13399” in the subject line of the e-mail.  Submission of questions via email containing anything
other than what is listed exactly as stated above for the subject line could result in your questions not being answered due to misrouting.

                                                                (End of Provision)


L.6  Incurring Costs (May 1998)

This solicitation does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, the Contracting
Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with the proposed
acquisition.

                                                                (End of Provision)


L.7  General Instructions (Negotiated) (Jan 2000)

(a) Offerors are invited to submit a proposal in response to this solicitation.  Offerors are also required to e-mail a complete copy of their
technical and business proposal to afx2@cdc.gov.  All proposals received will become part of the official file.

    (b) The following instructions establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and content of proposals.

    (c) Your proposal must be prepared in separate parts (technical and business) as instructed herein.  Each part shall be separate and
complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of evaluation of the other(s). The technical proposal must not
contain reference to cost; however, resource information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, material, subcontracts, etc., must
be contained in the technical proposal so that your understanding of the Statement of Work can be evaluated. The technical proposal must
disclose your technical approach in sufficient detail to provide a clear and concise presentation that addresses, but is not limited to, the
requirements of the technical proposal instructions.

(d) The proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind your organization. Offerors are required to e-mail a complete copy of their
technical and business proposal to afx2@cdc.gov.  All proposals received will become part of the official file.  Offerors are also required to
submit (mail) an original and three (3) copies of your proposal to:

    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
         Procurement and Grants Office (PGO)
    Acquisition and Assistance, Branch II, Team I
    Attn:  Jeff Miller
    2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3000, Mailstop K14
    Atlanta, GA  30341-5539
    Solicitation No. 2011-N-13398

L.8  Technical Proposal Instructions (Jan 2000)

      (a)  General Instructions


       (1)  The technical proposal must disclose the offeror’s technical approach in sufficient detail to provide a clear and concise proposal
that addresses, but is not limited to, the requirements of the technical proposal instructions.  Selection of an Offeror for contract award will
be based on an evaluation of proposals against three (3) factors.  The factors in order of importance are:  technical, cost, past performance.
Offerors are advised that in the evaluation process, all evaluations other than cost or price, when combined, are more important than cost or
price.  Services required/delivered must connect directly to costs in the business proposal.  The trade off process described in FAR 15.101-1
may be employed.  This process permits tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to consider award(s) to other
than the lowest priced or highest technically rated Offeror. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make an award(s) to that Offeror
whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.

                 (2)  The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of
the project as set forth in this solicitation.  The merits of each technical proposal will be carefully and individually evaluated.  Each
technical proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of this solicitation.  Offerors must submit
information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below.

                 (3)  These instructions establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and content of proposals.  Each page of
the offeror’s proposal will adhere to the following requirements: 8 ½  inch by 11 inch sheet of paper with one inch margins on all four sides.
Text shall be in Times New Roman, 12-point font, and single spaced between lines. Text pages should use portrait orientation. Page formatting
can alter for illustrations and tables but must be easily readable. Offerors may use no less than 8-point font on graphs and 10-point font on
tables (Arial font acceptable for graphics and tables). Header/footer information (which does not include any information to be evaluated) may
be included in the 1" margin space.  Fold-outs are discouraged, however if included they will be counted toward the appropriate number of pages
based upon an 8 -1/2 inch by 11 inch sheet of paper.  Offerors shall number each page in order to eliminate any confusion.

The technical proposal should be in as much detail as considered necessary to reflect a clear understanding of the nature of the work being
undertaken; and shall clearly show that they meet all of the Statement of Work requirements and be organized in the following order and format:

Provide a cover / contact page – the cover / contact page shall include the following information:
    • Company name
    • Name and title of the point of contact (POC) authorized to negotiate on behalf of the Offeror’s organization
    • Telephone number, email address, and mailing address of POC
    • Names, titles, email addresses, and telephone numbers of other POCs that CDC may contact if clarification of proposals is needed.
    • Solicitation name and number.
    • Provide a Table of Contents


      (b)  Evaluation Factors/Criteria – Technical Proposal

EACH OFFEROR MUST SUBMIT A TECHNICAL PROPOSAL THAT ADDRESSES BOTH THE SPECIFIC TECHNICAL APPROACH TO EACH TASK ORDER AND THE GENERAL TECHNICAL
APPROACH TO THE CONTRACT (SEE BELOW EVALUATION FACTORS/CRITERIA).  THE TECHNICAL PROPOSAL SHALL, AT A MINIMUM, BE IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS
CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO REFLECT A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORK UNDERTAKEN, AND ADDRESS SEPARATELY EACH OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS WHICH WILL BE
EVALUATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SECTION M AS THEY RELATE TO THE STATEMENT OF WORK AND DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS:

1.   Task Order Methodology and Technical Approach

Sample Task Orders.  All offerors are required to respond to each of the Sample Task Orders (see Section J).  Individual responses shall be
submitted for each sample task order identified below.







   a) Sample Task Order – National Immunization Survey – Core  (see Attachment J.6.)
   b) Sample Task Order – National Immunization Survey – Teen (see Attachment J.7)
   c) Sample Task Order – NIS/Influenza Vaccination Surveys (see Attachment J.8)
   d) Sample Task Order – SLAITS Major National Survey (SMNS) (see Attachment J.9)





Evaluation of Sample Task Order Proposals

The Government will utilize the Sample Request for Task Order Proposals (RFTOP) as a means of evaluating the business capabilities factor as it
reveals the offeror’s understanding of the requirement, innovativeness in approach to accomplishing the task, identification of risks and
management philosophy.  Offerors shall respond with individual proposals for each of  the Sample Task Order(s) located in Section J in
accordance with the instructions provided below.  The offeror shall respond to each separate Request for Task Order Proposal of interest by
providing a technical proposal and profile of the personnel to be assigned to each task order.  Each offer will be evaluated on both technical
and price merits.  Evaluation criteria are identified below.

M.2  Technical Strength More Important than Cost/Price (Jan 2000)

Offerors are advised that in proposal evaluation paramount consideration shall be given to technical proposals rather than to cost or price
unless, as a result of technical evaluations, proposals are judged to be essentially equal, in which case cost or price shall become the
determining factor. Furthermore, cost/price will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism which is defined as the offeror's ability to project
costs which are reasonable and indicate that the offeror understands the nature and extent of the work to be performed.  Note: the total
evaluated price for this evaluation will be the sum or total price of all task orders.

A technical rating of Acceptable must be achieved to be considered for award.  Price will only be evaluated for Technically Acceptable
proposals.  Discussions, if held, will be conducted only with those offerors determined to be within the competitive range.  Past Performance
will only be evaluated for those offerors in the competitive range.

Award shall be made to that responsible offeror submitting the proposal (Technical and Business) determined to be the most advantageous and the
best value to the Government as evaluated under the criteria described in this Section.

                                                                 (End of Clause)


M.3 Price Analysis

Price analysis will be performed based upon the pricing proposals submitted for the Sample Task Orders.  The pricing information provided in the
sample task proposals will be the only information utilized for purposes of evaluation of price in the determination of contract awards.

                                                                (End of Provision)






M.4 Source Selection

In evaluating proposals for award, the Government will perform a “best value” analysis, making award to the  offeror  whose  integrated  proposal
(technical, past performance, and business) offers the highest technical merit at the best overall value to the Government.  While  cost  is  not
expected to be the controlling factor in the selection of the successful offeror, the degree of importance of  cost  as  a  factor  could  become
greater depending upon the degree of equality of the technical proposal and other factors evaluated.  Where  competing  technical  proposals  are
determined to be substantially equal, cost/price and other cost/price related factors would become controlling factors.

                                                                (End of Provision)


M.5  Past Performance Evaluation (Adjectival Rating System) (Jan 2000)

Past performance information will be evaluated in the following manner:

    (a)  Each offeror shall be evaluated on its past performance under current and prior contracts.  By past performance, the Government means
the offeror's record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the contractor's record of forecasting and
controlling costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules and terms, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's
reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern
for the interest of the customer and the degree of quality of deliverables and performance.

    (b)  Past performance will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall quality of the offeror's past performance will be
highly influential in determining the relative merits of the offeror's proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered the
most advantageous/best value to the Government.

    (c)  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance for similar services relative to the size and
complexity of the procurement under consideration.

    (d)  The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror's past performance based on collaborated past performance evaluations included
in the offerors proposal and/or other information obtained from references provided by the offeror, as well as other relevant past performance
information obtained from other sources known to the Government.  The Government may or may not survey all contracts listed by the offeror, and
reserves the right to perform customer surveys only for those contracts which are deemed by the Government to be most relevant to this
procurement.  The Customer/Client Survey Letter and the Past Performance Survey Document included as attachments under Section J will be used by
the Government to gather any required past performance evaluations.

    (e)  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It
will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.

    (f)  The assessment of the offerors past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and the
other competitors. Thus, an offeror with an exceptional record of  relevant past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than
another whose record is acceptable and/or less relevant, even though both may have acceptable technical and business proposals.

    (g)  An offeror without a record of past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated
favorably or unfavorably.

    (h)  Information provided by Offerors, as requested under Section L herein, relating to problems encountered on the identified contracts and
the Offeror’s corrective actions will be considered when unfavorable reports of past performance are received.  If award will be made without
conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity clarify certain aspects of past performance information (e.g. relevance of an
offeror’s past performance information and averse past performance which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond).
Communications may be held with Offerors to obtain additional information regarding adverse past performance when required for making a
competitive range determination.   If discussions are held, offerors will be given an
         opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures
have been implemented.

    (i)  Past performance will be evaluated for only those offerors remaining in the competitive range.

    (j)  Evaluation of past performance information will be reflected in terms of the following degrees of performance assessment:

    Excellent:  A significant majority of the sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror’s performance was superior
    and that they would unhesitatingly do business with the offeror again.  Complaints are negligible or unfounded.  The offeror has no record of
    criminal conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old and the offeror has demonstrated by more recent performance that
    corrective action has made the likelihood of such conduct in the future highly improbably.  No doubt exists that the offeror will
    successfully perform the Government’s requirements as stated in the RFP.


    Good:  Most sources of information state that the offeror’s performance was good, better than average, etc., and that they would willingly do
    business with the offeror again.  Complaints, though perhaps well-founded, are few and relatively minor.  The offeror has no record of
    criminal conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old and the offeror has demonstrated by more recent performance that
    corrective action has made the likelihood of such conduct in the future highly improbable.  Little doubt exists that the offeror will
    successfully perform the Government’s requirements as stated in the RFP.


    Neutral:  Either no past performance history exists for the corporation, predecessor companies, key personnel, or major/critical
    subcontractors, or the offeror’s record of past performance was neither predominantly favorable nor unfavorable.  In the latter case, sources
    of information are roughly divided over the quality of the offeror’s performance.  While some state that they would do business with the
    offeror again, others are doubtful or would not.  Complaints are balanced by reports of good work.  The offeror has no record of criminal
    conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old.


    Marginal:  Many sources of information made unfavorable reports about the offeror’s performance and either express serious doubts about doing
    business with the offeror again or state that they would refuse to do so.  However, there are some favorable reports, and some sources of
    information indicate that they would do business wit the offeror again.  There are many significant, serious, and well-founded complaints,
    but there are some reports of very good performance.  The offeror may have been indicted, pled guilty, or may have been found guilty in
    matters of criminal conduct, but the issues are either unresolved, relatively minor, or do not reflect a company-wide or managerial pattern
    of wrongdoing.  The offeror may have lost civil suits for fraud or negligence, but there is no company-wide or managerial pattern of
    fraudulent, negligent, or criminal conduct.  Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government’s requirements as
    stated in the RFP.


    Poor:  A significant majority of sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror’s performance was entirely
    unsatisfactory and that they would not do business wit the offeror again under any circumstances.  Customer complaints are substantial or
    numerous and are well-founded.  Or, although not debarred or suspended, the offeror is under indictment or has been convicted of criminal
    conduct, or has been found civilly liable for fraud or negligence.  The offeror either has presented no persuasive evidence of having taken
    appropriate corrective action that will guard against such conduct in the foreseeable future, or it appears unlikely that the corrective
    action will be effective.  Serious doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government requirements as stated in the RFP.

                                                                (End of Provision)
                                                             -----------------------
   [1]  For purposes of computing per diem charges in lieu of actual subsistence charges, unless otherwise provided in the contract, a day is
   divided into four quarters that begin at 12 midnight, 6:00 AM, 12 noon, and 6:00 PM. For example, at an authorized per diem rate of $35.00 per
   day, a traveler who departed at 9:15 AM on July 15 and returned at 6:45 PM on July 18 would be entitled to $131.25.

Information Systems Management



Federal Information Systems Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 (P.L. 107-347) requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to safeguard information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor (including subcontractor), or other source.  FISMA requires agencies to provide information security protections commensurate with the security risks to federal information collected or maintained for the agency and information systems used or operated on behalf of an agency by a contractor.  

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued publications that provide guidance in the establishment of minimum security controls for management, operational and technical safeguards needed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a Federal Information system and its information.  

Pursuant to Federal and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Information Security Program policies, the contractor and any subcontractor performing under this contract shall comply with the following requirements:  



The contractor shall ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive federal information and/or federal information systems, including development of an IT Security Plan….. (see FAR 7.103(u), 7.105(b)(17), and 39.101). 



The contractor shall develop and maintain the software product in compliance with information system security regulatory requirements, while ensuring the application functions and performs in accordance with the business needs, objectives, and operational specifications agreed upon in this contract.  



The contractor will take appropriate action to mitigate security risks and vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with HHS and CDC policies as defined in FISMA and NIST security guidance.   



The contractor shall ensure information and system security requirements are considered and implemented, and complied with in all phases or stages of product during the period of performance of the contract.   



If new or unanticipated threats or vulnerabilities are discovered by either the Government or the Contractor, or if existing safeguards have ceased to function, the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other party for appropriate resolution and action. 



The contractor shall not publish or disclose in any manner, without the Contracting Officer’s written consent, the details of any safeguards either designed or developed by the Contractor under this contract or otherwise provided by the Government. 



The contractor shall afford the Government access to the Contractor’s facilities, installations, technical capabilities, operations, documentation, records, and databases to the extent required to carry out a program of inspection to safeguard against threats and hazards to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of Government data. 



The certification and accreditation (C&A) process remains the primary standard by which system security is evaluated.  Consistent with Departmental requirements, security documentation to include the constituent parts of the C&A package must be maintained and reviewed for each system reported under FISMA, including contractor systems.  A contractor system is defined as any general support system, major application, or minor application hosted or maintained by contractor staff including information system used or operated by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of CDC.  This includes all systems physically or logically located within the boundaries of the contractor facilities and systems which reside within CDC boundaries but the primary support for which is delivered by contractor staff.  NIST and Departmental guidance provide minimum documentation standards for C&A packages.  C&A packages typically consist of the following:



Risk Assessment

System Security Plan

Baseline Security Requirements

Contingency Plan and Contingency Plan Test Plan and Results

ST&E Plan and Security Assessment Report

Plan of Action and Milestones

Self Assessment



While CDC personnel are responsible for the review, approval, implementation, and annual evaluation of the C&A package and the SSP, the initial responsibility for the development of the required documentation may be assigned to the contractor.

Nondisclosure Agreement





The NIS and SLAITS and their adjunct surveys and activities involving data collection, processing, storage, and handling of nonpublic use data are conducted under the authority granted by the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 242k) and under Title V of PL 107-347 (the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, or CIPSEA).  Prior to allowing access to such confidential information, NCHS requires all applicable contractor staff to be trained in data security and confidentiality and the contractor to establish physical and electronic systems to ensure and demonstrate data security according to established standards and that these activities be documented.  These requirements are delineated in a Designated Agent Agreement (DAA).  A DAA template is provided below.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN NCHS AND [CONTRACTOR] 

 REGARDING DESIGNATION OF [CONTRACTOR Staff and its Contractors] AS NCHS AGENTS TO PERFORM STATISTICAL ACTIVITIES USING NCHS DATA



INTRODUCTION



The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducts statistical and epidemiological activities under authority granted by the Public Health Service Act (42 USC 242k). The National Immunization Survey (NIS) and its related surveys including but not limited to NIS Child, NIS Teen, and the National Household Flu Survey and the State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS), a data collection platform for multiple surveys including but not limited to the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN), the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), the National Survey of Adoptive Parents (NSAP), and the Survey of Pathways to Diagnosis and Services (SPDS), are conducted under this authority.  



Pursuant to the authority granted under Title V of PL 107-347 (the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, or CIPSEA) allowing NCHS to provide access to confidential information to designated agents, the NCHS designates staff from [CONTRACTOR] who have signed this agreement as NCHS agents to perform statistical activities related to NIS and SLAITS.  These surveys include names, addresses, telephone numbers, and other types of direct personal identifiers (e.g., dates of birth) that permit identification of individuals.



PURPOSE



The purpose of this agreement is to enable [CONTRACTOR] to complete the work specified in the scope of work in this Contract INSERT NUMBER through INSERT DATE.  These contracts specify that [CONTRACTOR] shall perform all activities necessary to conduct, complete, and document the results of telephone interviews and web and mailed questionnaires. These activities include developing materials and specifications; programming and testing of computer-assisted telephone interviewing and case management systems; hiring, supervising, and training interviewers; pretesting procedures; preparing and mailing advance letters and other survey field materials; conducting all interviews; administering incentives; data processing, editing, and weighting; data file preparation; data file documentation; and preparation of reports.













DATA SECURITY AND SAFEGUARDS



Access, storage and disposition of the data 



SLAITS has been certified at a moderate level of required protection for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. (Note: NIS must undergo certification prior to accessing confidential information.) [CONTRACTOR] agrees to provide adequate security arrangements for access to, storage, and disposition of all files, extracts, printed listings; or outputs to prevent unauthorized use of these data.  Security plans will comply with the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines.  Documentation from [CONTRACTOR] has been submitted to the NCHS Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) and the NIS and SLAITS Security Stewards for review and evaluation.  These security plans are part of the NIS and SLAITS C&A, (Note: Upon completion, a copy of the Authority to Operate will be attached.) 



To preclude observation of confidential information by persons other than designated agents, [CONTRACTOR] and its contractors shall maintain all SLAITS confidential records that identify individuals or from which individuals could be identified under lock and key.  Specifically, at each site where these items are processed or maintained, all confidential and restricted-use data that may permit identification of individuals or establishments are to be kept in locked containers when not in use. 



If records are maintained in electronic form, the medium on which files are stored (disks, CD-ROMS, DVDs,  external hard drives, laptops) must be encrypted and kept  under lock and key, or, if maintained on a computer, access secured by all available means (including keyboard locks, passwords, encryption, etc.). 



When confidential records are in use, whether by themselves or viewed on computer monitors, they must be kept out of the sight of persons not authorized to work with the records.



Except as needed for operational purposes, copies of confidential records are not to be made.  Any duplicate copies made of confidential records are to be destroyed as soon as operational requirements permit, using appropriate means of destruction such as shredding, burning, and macerating, or for electronic media intended for reuse, deleting files and then overwriting so that confidential information cannot be recovered.



No record containing direct personal identifiers (name, address, social security or other identifying number, unretouched video, or audio recording) of NCHS survey respondents may be electronically sent to or accessed from a contractor’s home or telecommuting work site or removed from contractor offices except as required in the conduct of data collection activities. Data stored on portable devices must be encrypted. Confidential data within [CONTRACTOR]’s network may be accessed only through encrypted tunnels such as Citrix.



It is understood that authorized staff of NCHS may, upon request, be granted access to premises where NIS or SLAITS data files are kept or used for the purpose of inspecting data security arrangements and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.



Data Transport



All transmissions between [CONTRACTOR] and NCHS of data collected by [CONTRACTOR] must utilize CDC’s SDN (Secure Data Network) or an alternative secure mechanism approved by the NCHS ISSO.  Under no circumstances should such data be transmitted through electronic mail or fax.





Disclosure and Confidentiality



It should be clearly understood that the number of persons with access to confidential information from NIS and SLAITS must be kept to a necessary minimum and a clear justification for their inclusion must be provided.



Being aware that they are subject to all of the requirements of both the Public Health Service Act and the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002, and with the understanding that violation of the terms of this agreement is subject to conviction of a class E felony, imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000, all persons on the attached list who will be granted access to data from NIS and SLAITS agree that:



 The NCHS data will be collected and accessed only for statistical purposes.  NIS and SLAITS information will not be used in any way to directly affect any survey participant (except as necessary to complete the survey interviews in accordance with the contract), or for administrative or judicial purposes.



 In accordance with the provisions of CIPSEA, the only persons to be granted access privileges to confidential SLAITS data will be those who: (a) are named in the list to be provided by the [CONTRACTOR] Data Custodian as authorized to have access to NIS and SLAITS data as NCHS Designated Agents; (b) have completed the NCHS Designated Agent forms; (c) have been certified as having seen the NCHS Confidentiality Videotape or read other NCHS training materials provided as an alternative to the videotape; (d) read the NCHS confidentiality statute section 308(d) (42 U.S.C. 242m(d) of the Public Health Services Act, excerpts of Title V of PL 107-347  (CIPSEA), Section 7 of the NCHS Confidentiality Manual and the SLAITS assurance of confidentiality; and (e) completed the Affidavit of Nondisclosure. The person identified as [CONTRACTOR]’s Data Custodian will certify these conditions have been met.



 Annually, and for every new person assigned to the project during the period of performance, [CONTRACTOR] is required to have each person accessing NIS and SLAITS confidential information review materials and complete forms as described in 3 B. above.  NCHS will be notified monthly of any new person assigned to the project during the period of performance and of any persons leaving the project.



 No NIS or SLAITS data covered under this Agreement will be accessed by anyone other than the NCHS Designated Agents identified by the [CONTRACTOR] Custodian.  All requests for identifiable NCHS data from any other party will be referred immediately to NCHS.  If [CONTRACTOR] suspects or experiences a breach, theft, or loss of NCHS Confidential information, the [CONTRACTOR] Custodian named in this agreement will notify the NCHS Chief Information Security Officer, John Macias 301-458-4370 or 301-738-4769 and the NCHS Confidentiality Officer, Eve Powell-Griner 301-458-4257 or 240-505-2488 within one hour of discovering the incident. 







[CONTRACTOR] CUSTODIAN OF NIS and SLAITS DATA



The [CONTRACTOR] Custodian of NIS and SLAITS data, [person’s name], is responsible for the observance of all conditions of access and use as well as the establishment and maintenance of security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access to NIS and SLAITS data.  It is the custodian’s responsibility to notify NCHS:

  	a) 	when access to the data is no longer needed,

	b) 	if a change in site access is contemplated, 

	c) 	of the intent to modify the project’s purpose and 	  

	d)	if these responsibilities are transferred. If responsibilities are to be transferred,  notification must be made promptly and before such official transfer is made.



The [CONTRACTOR] Custodian will follow the same procedures outlined in the prior section for NCHS Designated Agents, reviewing the same materials and completing the same forms (Attachments 1 and 2).



The [CONTRACTOR] Custodian will complete an additional form, Attachment 3 (Certification that Confidentiality Rules Have Been Reviewed by NCHS Designated Agents), attaching a list of all NCHS Designated Agents to this form, including justification for their inclusion.  The [CONTRACTOR] Custodian will ensure that all requirements specified in the prior section on NCHS Designated Agents are completed.   Completed forms should be sent to NCHS Program Representative.



The [CONTRACTOR] Custodian is responsible for certifying the destruction of all files, including backup files and derivative files containing NIS and SLAITS data at the end of the period of access specified in the contracts.  The Custodian will send the NCHS Program Representative notification of the destruction of files using the form found in Attachment 4 (Certification of Destruction of NCHS Data Files).



NCHS Program Representative



Duties of NCHS Program Representative:



1.  Ensures that the NCHS Designated Agent Agreement and Forms are properly completed and submitted. 



2.  Ensures (as applicable) that designated agent is aware of all pertinent provisions of the NCHS Staff Manual on Confidentiality – paying particular attention to Section 7.1 “Physical Protection of Confidential Records”.



3.  Ensures that all documents containing the names and other identifying information of designated agents are treated confidentially and securely maintained under lock and key.

‘‘No information, if an establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of activities undertaken or supported under section 242b, 242k,or 242l of this title may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless such establishment or person has consented (as determined under regulations of the Secretary) to its use for such other purpose; and in the case of information obtained in the course of health statistical or epidemiological activities under section 242b or 242k of this title, such information may not be published or released in other form if the particular establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable unless such establishment or person has consented (as determined under regulations of the Secretary) to its publication or release in other form.’’

Attachment 17:  Section 7 of the NCHS Staff Manual on Confidentiality

7. The Protection of Records and Data Systems 

Employees of NCHS are responsible for protecting all confidential records from prying eyes, unauthorized access, theft, and from accidental loss or misplacement due to carelessness. On this subject the Privacy Act, in Section 552a(e) prescribes that each agency shall: 

(9) Establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of any system of records, or in maintaining any record, and instruct each such person with respect to such rules and the requirements of this section, including any other rules and procedures adopted pursuant to this section and the penalties for noncompliance; 

(10) Establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.... 

In the case of NCHS, the Staff Manual on Confidentiality, taken as a whole, together with other administrative practices, fully addresses these requirements. Particular attention is directed to two major aspects: the protection of confidential records and the security of data systems. 

7.1 Physical Protection of Confidential Records 

Absolute protection of the records would be impossible; nevertheless, all reasonable precautions must be taken to protect them. It is the policy of NCHS that: 

	

A. Confidential records must be kept locked up at all times when they are not being used. That is, they must be kept in locked cabinets or in locked rooms after business hours and whenever the persons using them are not present. If records are maintained in electronic form, the medium on which the files are stored (floppy disks, CD-ROMS, and removable hard drives) must also be kept in locked containers or, if maintained on a computer, access secured by all available means (including keyboard locks, passwords, encryption, office locks, etc.). Personal computers containing confidential records should never be maintained in an open, unsecured space. Only a limited number of staff, as authorized by the Division or Branch Chief, may have keys or other means of access to such cabinets or rooms. 

B. When confidential records are in use, whether by themselves or viewed on computer monitors, they must be kept out of the sight of persons not authorized to work with the records.

 

C. Except as needed for operational purposes, copies of confidential records (paper documents, electronic files, video recordings, or records of other kinds) are not to be made. Any duplicate copies made of confidential records are to be destroyed as soon as operational requirements permit. Records not otherwise covered by record retention regulations (when in doubt, consult the NCHS Records Management Liaison) that are no longer needed should also be destroyed. Approved means of destruction include shredding, burning, and macerating. Should reuse of electronic media (hard drives, rewriteable compact disks) containing confidential records be contemplated, extreme care should be taken not to dispose of information in such a way that it can be recovered by unauthorized users of the electronic medium involved. For further guidance for the disposition of paper and other types of records, consult the NCHS Information Systems Security Officer. 







D. Paper or electronic records containing personally identifying information such as respondent name, address, or social security number should be held to the minimum number deemed essential to perform the Center’s functions, kept in a highly secure manner, and kept only so long as needed to carry out those functions.  A written justification for maintaining files with these items must be submitted to the Confidentiality Officer and, if approved, access restricted to the smallest number of staff consistent with that justification. The justification must include a statement specifying the time period after which these items will no longer be needed and provision for their subsequent deletion or destruction. 



E. No record containing direct personal identifiers (name, address, social security or other identifying number, unretouched video, or audio recording) of NCHS survey respondents may be electronically sent to or accessed from an employee’s or contractor’s alternate work site or removed from NCHS offices except as required in the conduct of data collection activities. Work outside the Center (whether at home or at an alternative work site) with ‘‘in-house’’ files (records stripped of direct identifiers but not approved for public use) must receive approval in advance. Such applications include all cases where confidential data would be accessed from outside NCHS offices and are not limited to flexiplace requests. The staff member will agree in writing not to download the contents of confidential files accessed from home or from an alternate work site. Confidential files are not approved to be used on laptop computers. Other security requirements as dictated by the NCHS Information Systems Security Officer must also be met. 



F. When records are transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration or its record centers for storage, their containers must be sealed. The storage center must be advised that no one may have access to those records except as authorized over the signature of an appropriate official of NCHS. Where destruction of records at a future date is cited in the NCHS Records Schedule, such destruction of records containing personally identifying information must be personally witnessed by the NCHS Records Management Liaison or his/her designee. 



G. When records containing names or other direct identifiers are transmitted between NCHS offices or between NCHS and its contractors, they must be packaged securely and sent by the most secure and trackable means available (e.g., Fed Ex, personal messenger, or directly by NCHS staff). 



H. Confidential records may not be released outside NCHS (to another agency, contractor, or other party) unless that release is consistent with the assurance of confidentiality under which they were gathered and positive evidence (appropriate contract language, a memorandum of understanding, or interagency agreement) that the receiving party will provide the same level of confidentiality protection as that required of NCHS. Agency staff and any contractors must be made liable to legal sanctions if the confidentiality pledge should be violated, and records must be maintained by the Program or Division under whose direction the information was collected listing all files released (to whom and under what agreement) containing confidential information. Such records should cover files made available to other divisions within NCHS as well as outside the Center. 

3‘‘Record’’ is defined in the Department’s regulations(45 CFR Part5)as including ‘‘books, brochures, punch cards, magnetic files, paper tapes, sound recordings, maps, pamphlets, photographs, slides, motion pictures, or other documentary materials. . .’’ In the case of NCHS, other examples of a ‘‘record’’ would be videos, x rays, and tissue or blood samples as well as electronic files in whatever form—CD-ROMS, diskettes, etc.

Quality Assurance Plan (QASP)

Purpose:  The purpose of this Quality Assurance Plan (QASP) is to describe the methodology for Government personnel to evaluate and assess contractor performance under the National Immunization Survey (NIS) contract with the Assessment Branch, Immunization Services Division of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.



Roles and Responsibilities:  The Contracting Officer is responsible for assessing the contractor’s performance, with input from the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR).  The contractor is responsible for managing performance and ensuring that quality controls meet the terms of the contract.  The COTR is responsible for completing annual performance evaluations and providing them to the Contracting Officer.  



Procedures:  Once the performance evaluation is completed, the Contracting Officer will review the data submitted.  The data collected at the task order level will also be rolled-up to the contract level

All negative responses (scores of “below average” and “poor”) received on a Performance Evaluation will be provided by the Contracting Officers for the Contractor’s response. 



Method of Assessment:  For all Task Orders, work performance will be assessed on an interim basis at six months, and on an annual basis through the Performance Evaluation which has the following areas of evaluation:  Technical, Management, Schedule, and Cost.  Under each of these areas, are detailed questions that have been developed to elicit specific customer feedback to be used by the Contracting Officers.  Also included in the Performance Evaluation is an area for comments that allows the COTR to provide additional input and feedback.  Attached to this plan is a copy of the Performance Evaluation Survey and Performance Standards Table for reference.



Successful Performance and Remedies:  Successful performance can be incentivized with favorable Past Performance Ratings, award of logical follow-on opportunities if applicable, and award of Award Term, where applicable.  Successful performance will be categorized on a task order basis by receiving satisfactory or above ratings for the majority of the questions on the average for one year or as determined by the Contracting Officer as appropriate for the task.   Remedies for non-performance of work would include poor Past Performance Ratings to be used as part of the evaluation criteria on all future task competitions, not awarding possible award term incentive, not awarding logical follow-on opportunities, notification to Contractor’s corporate headquarters of poor performance, and possibly non-payment for services not performed or milestones not met. In addition to the above, poor performance will be used by the Contracting Officer in making the determination whether or not to exercise the option for continuing the ordering period.  



Acceptance of Services:  Performance of services is accepted by an executed DD250 or AMSEL-AC 5124, as applicable. 



Customer Complaint Procedures and Training Instructions:  All customers have open access to the Contracting Officers, ACOs, and CORs/GTLs and provide both negative and positive feedback on contractor performance at all times.
