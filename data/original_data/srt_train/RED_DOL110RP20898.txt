F.4   Hours of Operation

DOL is normally accessible between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.; however, in no event will Contractor’s personnel be allowed to report
for work prior to the arrival of Government personnel.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday 8:00AM to 5:30PM, except for Federal
holidays, or when the Government facility is closed due to local or national emergencies, administrative closings or other Government directed
facility closings.  The work day consists of eight (8) hours per day covering the core hours of 9:30AM to 3:00PM. Work hours outside the normal

for work within the normal workday and administrative workweek unless prior approval has been granted for leave/vacation or other excused
absence (i.e., sick leave).


In the event the project takes more than the normal work hours to complete during any given work week, only approved overtime is allowed at the
discretion of the Contracting Officer (CO).  This approval must be in writing prior to the performance of any overtime worked by the service
provider unless during an emergency. During emergencies the request to work overtime can be done verbally, and the formal request must be
submitted within 48 hours after the emergency.

The contractor shall at all times maintain an adequate work force to provide for the uninterrupted performance of tasks defined within this
statement of work.  When hiring Contractor personnel, the Contractor shall keep in mind that the stability and continuity of the work force are
essential.  For all Contractor positions filled, anytime an employee misses more than five (5) consecutive days of work, the Contractor must
notify the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) and, if necessary, provide a backfill for that vacant position.

F.5   Holidays

The contractor must establish a standard holiday schedule that exactly coincides with the Government’s schedule.  Holidays and other non-work
days peculiar to or dynamically declared by the Government shall be considered as holidays for contractor personnel and are not billable unless
work is actually requested by the Government and performed on these days.  The following is a list of Government holidays:

present for work within the normal workday and administrative workweek unless prior approval has been granted for leave/vacation or other
excused absence (i.e., sick leave).  No work shall be performed by contractor personnel on Government holidays or non-work days (including
weekends) without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer.  Work performed on holidays shall be billable at regular rates as shown in
Section B.2.

F.6   Overtime

In the event it becomes necessary to utilize overtime, it shall be negotiated and approved in writing by the Contracting Officer prior to
incurring overtime costs.

   1) Work performed by an individual in excess of forty hours per week is considered to be overtime, provided that the individual performed the
      work under this contract and under a time and materials labor hour Task Order, performed the work in one of the labor categories in the
      final Schedule of the contract, and the individual is non-exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act.


   2) Overtime work shall fall within the domain of minimum-maximum hours for the appropriate labor category as set forth in the final Schedule
      of the contract.  In no event shall the total amount of overtime work authorized under this contract for a one year contract period exceed

   3) Overtime for non-exempt persons working in the labor categories of this contract will not be permitted without the prior written approval
      of the Contracting Officer.


   4) When a non-exempt individual is authorized by the Contracting Officer to work overtime in a labor category, the Government will pay the
      Contractor an overtime rate for the overtime services performed by that individual.  The overtime rate will be equal to the regular time
      rate plus fifty percent of the direct labor component in the regular time rate of that labor category.  The direct labor component is
      limited to the direct labor rate, FICA, State Unemployment Tax and Federal Unemployment Tax.


F.7   Travel and Per Diem


Travel may be required for contractor staff to attend information gathering meetings, management briefings, and other authorized meetings.  The
contractor shall be notified in writing by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative at least three days prior to travel.  The
following requirements apply:

   1. The Contractor shall be reimbursed for direct costs of transportation, lodging, meals and incidental expenses of personnel who are
      authorized to undertake out-of-town and/or overnight travel under this SOW.  Such costs shall be reimbursed in accordance with the
      established policy of the Contractor and to the extent that they are reasonable and allowable as provided in FAR 31.205-46, 31.3, 31.6, or
      31.7.


   2. Costs incurred for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses shall be reimbursed only to the extent that they do not exceed on a daily basis
      the maximum per diem rates in effect at the time of travel as set forth in the Federal Travel Regulations or Joint Travel Regulations.

   3. Air fare costs in excess of the lowest customary standard, coach, or equivalent air fare offered during normal business hours will not be

      submitted for reimbursement.


   4. The Contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of out-of-town and/or overnight travel performed by its personnel in their privately owned
      automobiles, at the current rate set forth in the Federal Travel Regulations, not to exceed the cost by the most direct economy air route

      such travel.


   5. No travel costs for contractor personnel traveling from place of residence to and from the normally assigned work site shall be reimbursed
      by the Government.


Travel policies as set forth in the Travel Regulations referred to below are required of the Contractor and consultants hereunder.  Where the
Contractor has a more restrictive travel policy than the Federal Travel Regulations, the more restrictive requirements shall apply.
Additionally, it is the responsibility of the Contractor to authorize only such per diem allowances as justified by the circumstances affecting
the travel.  Care should be exercised to prevent fixing per diem rates in excess of those required to meet the necessary authorized subsistence
expenses.  To this end, consideration should be given to factors which reduce the expenses of the employee such as: known arrangements at
temporary duty locations where lodging and meals may be obtained without cost or  at prices advantageous to the traveler; established cost
experience in the localities where lodging and meals are required; situations where special rates for accommodations have been made available
for a particular meeting or conference; the extent to which the traveler is familiar with establishments providing lodging and meals at a lower
cost in certain localities, particularly, where repeated travel is involved; and the use of methods of travel where sleeping accommodations are
provided as part of the transportation expenses.

All travel shall be at tourist, coach, or less than first class unless itinerary or unavailability dictates otherwise.  All temporary duty and
local area automobile travel shall be allowed as prescribed by the applicable Travel Regulations.

G.6.  Contractor Furnished Items and Services

Except for those items specifically stated to be government furnished in G.4 (above), the Contractor shall furnish everything required to

SECTION H – SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

H.1   Conflict of Interest

The policy of DOL is to avoid contracting with contractors who have unacceptable organizational conflicts of interest.  An organizational
conflict of interest means that because of existing or planned activities, an offeror or contractor is unable, or potentially unable, to render
impartial assistance to the agency, or has an unfair competitive advantage, or the offeror or Contractor’s objectivity is, or might be,
impaired.  If the offeror does not have any OCI issues, it must positively affirm so in writing.

The following provides potential vendors with examples of situations where mitigation plans may or may not be required by DOL.  These examples
are not intended to be inclusive.

Unequal Access to Information:  Access to “nonpublic information” as part of the performance of a DOL contract could provide the contractor a
competitive advantage in a later competition for any other DOL contract.  Such an advantage could easily be perceived as unfair by a competing
vendor who is not given similar access to the relevant information.  If the requirements of DOL procurement anticipate the successful contractor
may have access to nonpublic information, the successful contractor should be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.
Alternatively, the “nonpublic information” may be provided to all contractors.

Biased Ground Rules:  A contractor in the course of performance of a DOL contract, has in some fashion established important “ground rule” for
another DOL contract, where the same contractor may be a competitor.  For example, a contractor may have drafted the SOW, specifications, or
evaluation criteria of a future DOL procurement.  The primary concern of DOL in this case is that a contractor so situated could slant key
aspects of procurement in its own favor, to the unfair disadvantage of competing contractors.  If the requirements of DOL procurement anticipate
the contractor may have been in a position to establish important ground rules, including but not limited to those described herein, the
contractor should be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.

Impaired objectivity:  A contractor in the course of performance of a DOL contract is placed in a situation of providing assessment and
evaluation findings over itself, or another business division, or subsidiary of the same corporation, or other entity with which it has a
significant financial relationship.  The concern in this case is that the contractor’s ability to render impartial advice to DOL could appear to
be undermined by the contractor’s financial or other business relationship to the entity whose work product is being assessed or evaluated.  In
these situations, a “walling off” of lines of communication may well be insufficient to remove the perception that the objectivity of the
contractor has been tainted.  If the requirements of the DOL procurement indicate that the successful contractor may be in a position to provide
evaluations and assessments of itself or corporate siblings, or other entity with which it has a significant financial relationship, the
affected Contractor should provide a mitigation plan that includes recusal by the Contractor from the affected contract work.  Such recusal
might include divestiture of the work to a third party vendor.

Disclosure by offerors or contractors participating in a DOL acquisition.  Offerors or contractors should provide information which concisely
describes all relevant facts concerning any past, present or currently planned interest, (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise)
relating to the work to be performed and bearing on whether the offeror or contractor has a possible OCI.

If the offeror or Contractor does not disclose any relevant facts concerning an OCI, the offeror or Contractor, by submitting an offer or
signing the contract, warrants that to its best knowledge and belief, no such facts exist relevant to possible OCI.

It is not the intention of DOL to exclude a Contractor from a competitive acquisition due to a perceived OCI.  DOL Contracting Officers are
fully empowered to evaluate each potential OCI scenario based upon the applicable facts and circumstances.  The final determination of such
action may be negotiated between the impaired Contractor and the DOL Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer’s business judgment and sound
discretion in identifying, negotiating, and eliminating OCI scenarios should not adversely affect DOL’s policy for competition.  DOL is
committed to working with potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and perceived OCI situations, without detriment to the integrity of
the competitive process, the mission of DOL, or the legitimate business interests of the vendor community.

Mitigation plans:  The successful Contractor will be required to permit a Government audit of internal OCI mitigation procedures for
verification purposes.  DOL reserves the right to reject a mitigation plan, if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, such a plan is not in
the best interest of DOL.  After award, DOL will review and audit OCI mitigation plans as needed (in the event of any changes due to mergers,
consolidations, or any unanticipated circumstances that may create an unacceptable organizational conflict of interest).

Removal of Contractor Personnel: The Department of Labor retains the right to request removal of contractor personnel, or exclude them from
access to DOL sites, regardless of position, tenure, or other status, whose actions, while assigned to this contract conflict with the interests
of the DOL.

H.2   Compliance with Nondiscrimination and Equal Opportunity Laws

The assurance at 29 CFR 37.20(a)(1) is incorporated by reference into this contract.  The assurance provides that the contractor will comply
fully with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of the following statutes:

         • Section 188 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA), which prohibits discrimination against all individuals in the United States
           on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or political affiliation or belief, and against
           beneficiaries on the basis of either citizenship/status as a lawfully admitted immigrant authorized to work in the United States or
           participation in any WIA Title I-financially assisted program or activity;
         • Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, which prohibits discrimination on the bases of race, color and national origin;
         • Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1964, as amended, which prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with
           disabilities;
         • The Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age; and
         • Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs.

The contractor also assures that it will comply with 29 CFR part 37 and all other regulations implementing the statutes listed above.  This
assurance applies to the contractor’s operation of, or provision of services to, a Job Corps Center, program or activity, and to all
subcontracts entered into by the contractor to carry out the Job Corps program or activity, or its operation of the Center.  The contractor
understands that the United States has the right to seek judicial enforcement of this assurance.

H.14. Contractor Employee Suitability and Security Requirements


  (1) Background Investigations
 
   a. Background Investigation Requirements.  The investigation requirements for contractor employees are based on the risk or sensitivity level
designation of the position.  The Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, or other DOL Agency's designated official
informs the Contractor of the risk or sensitivity level for each contractor employee position.  The minimum level of investigation for each risk
or sensitivity level is indicated below.
 

Position Risk/Sensitivity Level:             Minimum Investigation Requirement:
 
Low Risk/Non-sensitive                       National Agency Check & Inquiries (NACI)
Moderate Risk                                Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
High Risk                                    Background Investigation (BI)
Noncritical-Sensitive                        Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)*
Critical-Sensitive                           Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI)*

  * Individuals occupying Critical-Sensitive positions (i.e., require Top Secret security clearances) are subject to reinvestigation every 5
years.  Individuals occupying Noncritical-Sensitive positions are subject to reinvestigation every 10 years for Secret security clearances and
every 15 years for confidential security clearances.
 
   b. Conducting Background Investigations.  All contract employees require a background investigation.  The Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) will conduct background investigations for DOL employees and contractor employees. Since OPM only accepts requests from Federal agencies
to conduct background investigations, the DOL Agency will make arrangements with the Contractor to send the contractor employee's completed
papers to the DOL Agency for submission to OPM.
 
   c. Payment for Background Investigation.  If the DOL Agency bears the cost for background investigations on contractor employees, the
designated DOL Agency official will forward the required documents to OPM.  If the Contractor bears the cost of the investigations,
 
 
(2)  The Investigation Process

The Contractor shall submit written procedures to the designated DOL Agency official describing the method
by which the following investigation requirements will be satisfied.

completed OMB Form-3206, Declaration for Federal Employment, on which the employee has completed items 1 through 7c, questions 9 through 13, and
item 16 as necessary, and  has signed item 17.  This form can be found at the following website: http://www.opm.gov/forms.  If the Contractor
has not received a completed OMB Form-3206 from the contractor employee within 5 days after requesting the form, the Contractor shall notify.
 
   If the person answers "Yes" to one or more of questions 9 through 13, the Contractor shall notify immediately.  The designated DOL Agency
official will inform the Contractor whether or not the contractor employee may work on the contract.  Before making this decision the designated
DOL Agency official may also require a pre-employment FBI fingerprint check on contract employees.  This procedure is described in Chapter 2,
Section 6.
 
   b. Submission of Investigation Documents.  The Contractor shall submit the required documents below to the designated DOL Agency official
within 14 calendar days of each contractor employee's placement on the contract in a High Risk, Moderate Risk, Low Risk, or Noncritical-
Sensitive position.  However, the Single Scope Background Investigation must be completed before the contractor employee is placed in a Critical-
Sensitive position, unless the Department approves the placement of the contractor employee's placement in the position before the investigation
is completed.  The specific form that he or she completes depends on the risk or sensitivity level of the work that he or she will perform. 
These forms can be found on the following website: http://www.opm.gov/forms
 
The SF-85, Questionnaire for Non-sensitive Positions, is used with positions or work that are designated at the Low Risk level.  The minimum
investigation required is a National Agency Check and Inquiries.
 
The SF-85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, is used with positions or work that is designated at the Moderate or High Risk level.  The
minimum investigation required for the Moderate Risk level is a Minimum Background Investigation.  The minimum investigation required for the
High Risk level is a Background Investigation.
The SF-86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, is used with positions or work that is designated at the Noncritical-Sensitive or
Critical-Sensitive level.  The minimum investigation for Noncritical-Sensitive work is a Minimum Background Investigation.  The minimum
investigation for Critical-Sensitive work is a Single Scope Background Investigation.
 
 The Contractor shall also ensure that each contractor employee is fingerprinted using Form FD-258.  The Contractor can get copies of this form
from:

http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/pdf/fpcardb.pdf#search=%22FD%20258%22
 
 The Contractor shall submit the following completed forms and documents for each contractor employee based on the risk or sensitivity level of
work that such employee is performing:
 
  Low Risk                   High/Moderate Risk               Critical/Noncritical Sensitive
 
  SF-85                           SF-85P                                             SF-86
  FD-258                          FD-258                                             FD-258
  OF-306                          OF-306                                             OF-306
  Application/Resume              Application/resume                      Application/resume
 
 c. Temporary Contractor Employees.  If the contractor employee is assigned to Low Risk work and is employed on a seasonal, daily, or
intermittent basis, or for no more than 180 days, the NACI is not required.  However, the Contractor shall submit the fingerprints of the
contractor employee on a Form FD-258.

 (3) Adjudication
 
   a. Referral of Suitability Issues.  When OPM has completed the contractor employee's background investigation, it shall send the report of
investigation to the Department's Office of Executive Resources and Personnel Security (OERPS).  If the report contains suitability issues, the
OERPS will forward the report to the designated DOL Agency official for review and adjudication.
 
   b. Suitability Standard and Criteria.  The suitability standard and criteria are described in Chapter 3, Section 3.
 
   c. Unfavorable Suitability Determination.  If the designated DOL Agency official determines that the contractor employee is unsuitable, the
Contracting Officer will inform the Contractor in writing that the contractor employee is denied access to DOL facilities and/or information and
information systems.  If revoking access to DOL facilities and/or information and information systems negatively impacts the contractor

efficiency levels. The microcomputer, as configured with all components, must be Energy Star compliant.

This low-power feature must already be activated when the computer equipment is delivered to the agency and be of equivalent functionality of
similar power managed models.  If the equipment will be used on a local area network, the vendor must provide equipment that is fully compatible
with the network environment.  In addition, the equipment will run commercial off-the-shelf software both before and after recovery from its
energy conservation mode.

H.25  Meetings/Conferences

Technical meetings and/or post-award/pre-performance conferences may be necessary to resolve problems and to facilitate understanding of the
technical requirements of the contract. Participants at these meetings/conferences shall be members of the contractor’s technical staff and
technical representatives of the Department of Labor. These meetings/conferences shall be scheduled with the agreement and arrangements made
between Contracting Officer, or his representative, and the contactor. Records of these meetings/conferences shall be made by the contractor and
approved by the Department of Labor. All costs associated with the attendance at these meetings/conferences shall be incidental to the contract
and not separately billed.

I.2.  52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)


   The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.  These rates

   (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.

   (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed sixty six (66) months.

     (2)  Except for novation agreements and advance payments, delegates to the Office of Assistant Secretary for Administration & Mgmt. the

     (3)  That payments to be made under the contract will be made directly to the subcontractor by the contracting activity.

     (4)  To notify the Office of Assistant Secretary for Administration & Mgmt. Contracting Officer immediately upon notification by the

Officer under the "Disputes" clause of the subcontract.

   (b)  The offeror/subcontractor agrees and acknowledges that it will, for and on behalf of the SBA, fulfill and perform all of the
requirements of the contract.
    (c) The offeror/subcontractor agrees that it will not subcontract the performance of any of the requirements of this subcontract to any
lower tier subcontractor without the prior written approval of the SBA and the cognizant Contracting Officer of the Office of Assistant
Secretary for Administration & Mgmt..


I.5.  52.219-18 NOTIFICATION OF COMPETITION LIMITED TO ELIGIBLE 8(a) CONCERNS  (JUNE 2003)

I.6   52.219-28 POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (APR 2009)


   (a) Definitions. As used in this clause-

   Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that
exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the
clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

   Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of
operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size
standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or
major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining
whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial
resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales
territory, and nature of business activity.

   (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall re-represent its
size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the
following:

     (1) Within 30 days after execution of a Novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if
the Novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

     (2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a Novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to
include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

     (3) For long-term contracts-

       (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

       (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.

   (c) The Contractor shall re-represent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this re-representation
that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard
corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.

   (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a
construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

   (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the re-representation required by paragraph (b) of this
clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the
Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the
contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and
provide the date of the validation or update.

   (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is
not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

   (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code
applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following re-representation and submit it to the contracting office,
along with the contract number and the date on which the re-representation was completed:

   The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 541512 assigned to contract number.

 [Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].

I.7  52.222-2  PAYMENT FOR OVERTIME PREMIUMS (JUL 1990)


(a) The use of overtime is authorized under this contract if the overtime premium does not exceed $0.00 or the overtime premium is paid for
work—

      (1) Necessary to cope with emergencies such as those resulting from accidents, natural disasters, breakdowns of production equipment, or
occasional production bottlenecks of a sporadic nature;

      (2) By indirect-labor employees such as those performing duties in connection with administration, protection, transportation, maintenance,
standby plant protection, operation of utilities, or accounting;

      (3) To perform tests, industrial processes, laboratory procedures, loading or unloading of transportation conveyances, and operations in
flight or afloat that are continuous in nature and cannot reasonably be interrupted or completed otherwise; or

      (4) That will result in lower overall costs to the Government.

(b) Any request for estimated overtime premiums that exceeds the amount specified above shall include all estimated overtime for contract
completion and shall—
      (1) Identify the work unit; e.g., department or section in which the requested overtime will be used, together with present workload,
staffing, and other data of the affected unit sufficient to permit the Contracting Officer to evaluate the necessity for the overtime;
      (2) Demonstrate the effect that denial of the request will have on the contract delivery or performance schedule;
      (3) Identify the extent to which approval of overtime would affect the performance or payments in connection with other Government
contracts, together with identification of each affected contract; and
      (4) Provide reasons why the required work cannot be performed by using multishift operations or by employing additional personnel.

* Insert either “zero” or the dollar amount agreed to during negotiations. The inserted figure does not apply to the exceptions in
paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(4) of the clause.




I.8   52.222-41 SERVICE CONTRACT ACT OF 1965 (NOV 2007)


   (a)  Definitions.  As used in this clause--

   "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.).

   "Contractor" when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime
Contractor."

   "Service employee," means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised.  It
includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such
persons.

   (b)  Applicability.  This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations
of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4).  This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary
of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4.

   (c)  Compensation.

     (1)  Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than
the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary
of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract.

     (2)(i)  If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not
listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in
the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages
and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c).

       (ii)  This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of
employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the
Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work.  The Contracting Officer shall review
the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or
disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all
pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor.  The Wage and Hour Division
will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will
notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary.

       (iii)  The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer
who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of
such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination.

       (iv)(A)  The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage
determination cannot be reduced to any single formula.  The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on
the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point
schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal
pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality.  Basic to
the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based
on the skill required and the duties performed.

         (B)  In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where
a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a
new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed
rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and
fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those
specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination.  Where conforming actions are accomplished in
accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the
Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed.

         (C)  No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage
specified under section (6)(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.

       (v)  The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees
performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the
unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to
the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract.

       (vi)  Upon discovery of failure to comply with subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final
determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of
employees commenced contract work.

     (3)  Adjustment of Compensation.  If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required
to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than
once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division.

   (d)  Obligation to Furnish Fringe Benefits.  The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits
specified in the attachment or determined under subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe
benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4.

   (e)  Minimum Wage.  In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this
contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum
wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any
subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee.

   (f)  Successor Contracts.  If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished
in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence
of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the
Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether
or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective
bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and
fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement.  No Contractor or subcontractor
under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor
or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided
for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines,
as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was
not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations.  Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10
and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining
agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective
bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length
negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits.  Such
determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law
Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a
contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial
variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision.

   (g)  Notification to Employees.  The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work
on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage
determination attached to this contract.  The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent
and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract.

   (h)  Safe and Sanitary Working Conditions.  The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this
contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the
Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees.  The Contractor or
subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925.

   (i)  Records.

     (1)  The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of
the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment
Standards Administration, a record of the following:

       (i)  For each employee subject to the Act -

         (A)  Name and address and social security number;

         (B)  Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates
of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation;

         (C)  Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and

         (D)  Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee.

       (ii)  For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe
benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this
clause.  A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement.
        (iii)  Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of
this clause.

     (2)  The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the
Wage and Hour Division.

     (3)  Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the
regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of
Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation
ceases.

     (4)  The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the
worksite during normal working hours.

   (j)  Pay Periods.  The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without
subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments
shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued.  A pay period
under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly.

   (k)  Withholding of Payments and Termination of Contract.  The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government
Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of
Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or
subcontractor.  In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act,
the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take
action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply
with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the
Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional
cost.

   (l)  Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act.

   (m)  Collective Bargaining Agreements Applicable to Service Employees.  If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service
employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining
agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report
such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits,
including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement.

agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof.

   (n)  Seniority List.  Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees
may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit
provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall
furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the
last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or
predecessor Contractors of each such service employee.  The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the
commencement of the succeeding contract.

   (o)  Rulings and Interpretations.  Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4.

   (p)  Contractor's Certification.

     (1)  By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or
firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the
sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act.

     (2)  No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of
the Act.

     (3)  The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001.

   (q)  Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions Involving Employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this
clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of
Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or
to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business.

     (1)  Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency or injury may be
employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe
benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed
for the employment of apprentices, student- learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of
the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).

     (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or
handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay
under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or
supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938 (29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525).

     (3)  The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR Parts 525 and
528.

   (r)  Apprentices.  Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed
and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S.
Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training,
Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor.  Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program
shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work
actually performed.  The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the
registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The
allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio
permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program.

   (s)  Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may
have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in
accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed
$1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision -

     (1)  The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized;

     (2)  The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer
elects to take a credit for tips received);

     (3)  The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage
through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and

     (4)  The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of
section 4(c) of the Act.

   (t)  Disputes Concerning Labor Standards.  The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR Parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving
disputes concerning labor standards requirements.  Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes
clause of this contract.  Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and
the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives.


I.9   52.222-42 STATEMENT OF EQUIVALENT RATES FOR FEDERAL HIRES (MAY 1989)

I.10  52.222-43 FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT AND SERVICE CONTRACT ACT - PRICE ADJUSTMENT (MULTIPLE YEAR AND OPTION CONTRACTS) (SEP 2009)


   (a)  This clause applies to both contracts subject to area prevailing wage determinations and contracts subject to collective bargaining
agreements.

   (b)  The Contractor warrants that the prices in this contract do not include any allowance for any contingency to cover increased costs for
which adjustment is provided under this clause.

   (c)  The wage determination, issued under the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.), by the Administrator, Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, current on the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or
the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract.  If no such determination has been made applicable to this contract,
then the Federal minimum wage as established by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, (29 U.S.C. 206) current on
the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract.

   (d) The contract price, contract unit price labor rates, or fixed hourly labor rates will be adjusted to reflect the Contractor's actual
increase or decrease in applicable wages and fringe benefits to the extent that the increase is made to comply with or the decrease is
voluntarily made by the Contractor as a result of:

     (1)  The Department of Labor wage determination applicable on the anniversary date of the multiple year contract, or at the beginning of
the renewal option period.  For example, the prior year wage determination required a minimum wage rate of $4.00 per hour. The Contractor chose
to pay $4.10.  The new wage determination increases the minimum rate to $4.50 per hour.  Even if the Contractor voluntarily increases the rate
to $4.75 per hour, the allowable price adjustment is $.40 per hour;

     (2)  An increased or decreased wage determination otherwise applied to the contract by operation of law; or

     (3)  An amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that is enacted after award of this contract, affects the minimum wage, and
becomes applicable to this contract under law.

   (e)  Any adjustment will be limited to increases or decreases in wages and fringe benefits as described in paragraph (d) of this clause, and
the accompanying increases or decreases in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but shall not otherwise
include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.

   (f)  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any increase claimed under this clause within 30 days after receiving a new wage
determination unless this notification period is extended in writing by the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor shall promptly notify the
Contracting Officer of any decrease under this clause, but nothing in the clause shall preclude the Government from asserting a claim within the
period permitted by law.  The notice shall contain a statement of the amount claimed and the change in fixed hourly rates (if this is a time-and-
materials or labor-hour contract), and any relevant supporting data, including payroll records, that the Contracting Officer may reasonably
require. Upon agreement of the parties, the contract price, contract unit price labor rates, or fixed hourly rates shall be modified in writing.
The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment and its effective date.

   (g)  The Contracting Officer or an authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books,
documents, papers and records of the Contractor until the expiration of 3 years after final payment under the contract.

subject to mark and count and, therefore, ceases to be bulk cargo.

   Employee assigned to the contract means an employee who was hired after November 6, 1986, who is directly performing work, in the United
States, under a contract that is required to include the clause prescribed at 22.1803. An employee is not considered to be directly performing

       (iii) Verify employees assigned to the contract. For each employee assigned to the contract, initiate verification within 90 calendar
days after date of enrollment or within 30 calendar days of the employee's assignment to the contract, whichever date is later (but see

government of a Federally recognized Indian tribe; or a surety performing under a takeover agreement entered into with a Federal agency pursuant
to a performance bond, the Contractor may choose to verify only employees assigned to the contract, whether existing employees or new hires. The
Contractor shall follow the applicable verification requirements at (b)(1) or (b)(2), respectively, except that any requirement for verification
of new employees applies only to new employees assigned to the contract.

     (4) Option to verify employment eligibility of all employees. The Contractor may elect to verify all existing employees hired after
November 6, 1986, rather than just those employees assigned to the contract. The Contractor shall initiate verification for each existing

        (i) The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Social Security Administration (SSA) may terminate the Contractor's MOU and deny
access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the terms of the MOU. In such case, the Contractor will be referred to a suspension or
debarment official.

       (ii) During the period between termination of the MOU and a decision by the suspension or debarment official whether to suspend or debar,
the Contractor is excused from its obligations under paragraph (b) of this clause. If the suspension or debarment official determines not to
suspend or debar the Contractor, then the Contractor must reenroll in E-Verify.

Security Web site: http://www.dhs.gov/E-Verify

   (d) Individuals previously verified. The Contractor is not required by this clause to perform additional employment verification using E-

     (2) Who has been granted and holds an active U.S. Government security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top secret
information in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual; or

     (3) Who has undergone a completed background investigation and been issued credentials pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive
(HSPD)-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors.

identification of the parties), in each subcontract that--

     (1) Is for--(i) Commercial or noncommercial services (except for commercial services that are part of the purchase of a COTS item (or an
item that would be a COTS item, but for minor modifications), performed by the COTS provider, and are normally provided for that COTS item); or

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.35 per hour or $134.00 per week or $580.66 per month

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.
Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the
predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the
named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)


THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a
bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer System Analysts and
Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an
hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all
occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within
those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances
may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within
the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA
wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance
note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of
the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and
whose primary duty consists of:

(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system
functional specifications;

(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes,
based on and related to user or system design specifications;

(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or
(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).


2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will
earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.  If you are a full-time employed
(40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25%
of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is
considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard
when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending,
dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash
powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.   Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance
operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close
proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration
of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate
or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary
ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by
the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer,
by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an
expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The
Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees
for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all
contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing
of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or
$.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed
and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering
in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the
nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April
2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home
page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/


REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the
contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the
contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and
the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by
such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement
date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a
class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency
(FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the
agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the
employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of
employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations
and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards
Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting
officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job
definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not
the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be
used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

K.5  52.209-5  CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (DEC 2008)


   (a)
      (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -
        (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -

         (A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

         (B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against
them for:  commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state,
or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

         (C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of
any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and

         (D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount
that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

           (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

             (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not
finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the
liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

             (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability
when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

           (2) Examples.

             (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

             (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a
notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to
further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to
contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax
because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer
has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

             (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments
and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full
payment.

             (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed
under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

             (ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default
by any Federal agency.

     (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business
segment; and similar positions).

   THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR
FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.

   (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

   (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award
under this solicitation.  However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility.
Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the
Offeror non-responsible.

   (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith,
the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision.  The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which
is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

   (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making
award.  If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD



M.1  NOTICE LISTING SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE


The following solicitation provisions pertinent to this section are hereby incorporated by reference (by Citation Number, Title, and Date) in
accordance with the FAR provision at FAR "52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE" in Section L of this solicitation. See FAR
52.252-1 for an internet address (if specified) for electronic access to the full text of a provision.


      NUMBER     TITLE DATE

      52.217-5   EVALUATION OF OPTIONS  JUL 1990



M.2.  EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


I – Evaluation Factors for Award

(a) The Government will award a single Labor-Hour contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to
the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to
evaluate offers:


  (1) Technical
    • Subfactor 1- Understanding of the Requirement
    • Subfactor 2- Project Management Plan
    • Subfactor 3 – Personnel Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel
    • Subfactor 4 – Start Up/Phase-Out Plan
    • Subfactor 5:  Quality Control Plan


  (2) Past Performance
  (3) Price

Basis for Award:  Technical and Past Performance are of equal importance and, when combined, are significantly more important than price when
being evaluated.  However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. The Government will not make
an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical features.

(b) The Government will award a single Labor-Hour contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to
the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government based on the best overall proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the
Government, with appropriate consideration given to all the evaluation factors. All sub-factors under Volume I, Technical are of equal
importance.

(c) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). The total price offered (base year, option period(s), will be used as the overall
evaluated price.

(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

II – Evaluation Rating Definition

 (a) Offeror’s technical proposals will be evaluated qualitatively based on the evaluation factors provided herein.  The following adjectives
will be used by the Government to evaluate the individual technical factors to determine an overall rating.



    • EXCEPTIONAL – The contractor’s technical proposal meets the fullest expectations of the Government,  The offeror has convincingly
      demonstrated that the RFP’s requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when
      implemented, will result in an exceptional, effective, efficient, and economical performance under the contract.  As assigned rating within
      “exceptional” indicates that, in terms of the specific factor (or subfactor), the proposal contains essentially no weaknesses or
      deficiencies and meets the fullest expectations of the Government.



    • VERY GOOD – The contractor’s technical proposal is fully responsive with no significant deficiencies.  Fulfilling the definition of “very
      good” indicates that, in terms of the specific factor (or subfactor), the proposal demonstrates a level of effort that meets the RFP’s
      requirements and that this effort has produced, or could produce, results which will prove to be substantially beneficial to the project.



    • SATISFACTORY – The contractor’s technical proposal is adequately responsive with minor deficiencies but no major deficiencies noted.  As
      assigned rating within “satisfactory” indicates that, in terms of the specific factor or (subfactor), any deficiencies noted are of a minor
      nature that should not seriously affect the offeror’s performance.  A rating with “satisfactory” is used when there are no indications of
      exceptional features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial, or contrarily, weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the
      effort or increase the risks of failure.



    • MARGINAL – The proposal contains weaknesses in several areas that are not offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of “marginal”
      indicates that, in terms of the specific factor (or subfactor), the offeror may satisfactorily complete the assigned tasks, but there is at
      least a moderate risk that he will not be successful.



    • UNACCEPTABLE – The proposal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific factor(s) (or subfactor(s)).  The offeror’s
      interpretation of the Government’s requirement is so superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect as to be
      unacceptable.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of “unacceptable” indicates that the evaluator feels that mandatory corrective
      action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall project.  A rating of “unacceptable in any one
      factor may result in the offero’s entire proposal being rated as “unacceptable”.


(b)  To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than “Satisfactory” must be achieved for each evaluation factor.

(c) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer
should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions
if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such actions is in the
public interest and/or waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

(d) Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:  The Government may  reject  any  proposal  that  is  evaluated  to  be  unrealistic  in  terms  of  program
commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government  estimates,  such  that
the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risk(s) of the program.

(e) Correction Potential of Proposals:  The Government will consider the “correction potential” of any deficiency or uncertainty.  The judgment
of such “correction potential” is within the sole discretion of the Government.  If an aspect of an Offeror’s proposal not meeting the
Government’s requirements is not considered correctable, the Offeror may be removed from further consideration.

(f) Pursuant to FAR 15.306(c) the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals,
unless the range is further reduced for reasons of efficiency.  Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1(f) (4), the Contracting Officer may limit the number of
proposals in the competitive range to the number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

    • Subfactor 1- UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT – The Government will evaluate the offeror’s understanding of the work to be performed,
      described in the SOW, demonstrated understanding of the work described in this solicitation and the extent to which potential risks are
      identified and mitigated.

    • Subfactor 2- PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN – The Government will evaluate the adequacy and suitability of the proposed organization for
      performing the work efficiently and effectively including but not limited to the staffing plan for the project team including project
      management relationships to the firm and backup as required;

    • Subfactor 3 - PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE OF KEY PERSONNEL - The Government will evaluate the experience and qualifications of
      all key contractor personnel and the staffing capability of the offeror to continue to staff the contract as new tasks are issued.


    • Subfactor 4 – START-UP/PHASE-OUT PLAN - The Government will evaluate  the Start-Up Plan to determine if it offers a  reasonable, effective
      and realistic approach to quality control for assuming full contractual responsibility without disruption or degradation of performance.
      The plan will be evaluated on whether it identifies risk, proposes appropriate mitigation strategies, proposes a realistic, achievable and
      affordable start-up schedule and staffing plan.  The plan will be evaluated on whether it ensures sufficient resources are on hand and
      available to begin work under this requirement.  It shall include a statement that the personnel proposed are available, trained, and
      qualified to perform the work under this effort.  In addition the government will evaluate the Phase-Out Plan on whether it provides a
      smooth transition to replacement services when the contract period of performance ends.  Contractors are required to submit their staffing
      plan with their proposal or their proposal may not be considered acceptable.


    • Subfactor 5:  QUALITY CONTROL PLAN - The Government will evaluate how the offeror intends to monitor, inspect, and correct deficiencies for
      the requirements of the SOW for whether the plan is likely to result in the highest quality of work possible.  The Government may
      incorporate the QCP in the contract that will result from this solicitation.  The QCP will no longer be considered proprietary and will be
      considered releasable under FOIA.


Evaluation of Factor 2 –Past Performance

The Government will evaluate past performance of at least three relevant contracts based on how well the contractor performed on projects.
Offerors are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources
other than those identified by the offeror and the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value
decision.  The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Contracts listed may include those entered into
with Government agencies or private sectors.  For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account
information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance, or subcontractors that will
perform key aspects of the requirement.

The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire.

The past performance evaluation will be accomplished through  assignment  of  a  confidence  assessment  rating  on  a  combination  of  recency,
relevancy, reliability and quality of performance. Although the past performance evaluation focuses on performance that is relevant to  Technical
Ability/Approach, the resulting Performance Confidence Assessment represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance.

Under the Past Performance factor, the Performance Confidence Assessment represents the evaluation of an Offeror’s present and past  work  record
to assess the Government's confidence in the Offeror’s probability of successfully performing as proposed.   The  Government  will  evaluate  the
Offeror's demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying services that meet the user's needs, including but not limited to,  controlling
costs, adhering to schedules (including the administrative aspects of performance), and performance  (reasonable  and  cooperative  behavior  and
commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally, the contractor’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer).

Past performance information to be evaluated will include the Offerors’ records of providing high-quality services; standards of good technical
and analytic workmanship; adherence to contract schedules; administrative aspects of contract performance; quality, availability and stability
of personnel and commitment to customer’s mission/goals.  The evaluation will be constrained to the most recent and relevant contracts for a
comprehensive review.

Recent:  In order to be considered recent, the services must have been provided within the last three years from the date of solicitation
release.

If an Offeror has no single project that encompasses all types of the required experience, the Offeror may:  (i) Show relevant experience
through a combination of projects that together show that work has been accomplished that is consistent in scope and complexity with the SOW;
(ii) Show relevant experience through personnel who are proposed to work on the contract that have had the required experience with another
company.

Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated
favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a "Unknown Confidence" rating for the Past Performance factor.  For
Offerors with no relevant performance record, the Government may consider relevant performance information regarding key personnel.

Adverse past performance is considered any rating below Satisfactory on any questionnaire, survey or Government evaluation.  Offerors with
adverse past performance will be afforded an opportunity to address alleged deficiencies, if the Offeror has not already been provided an
opportunity to comment on the deficiencies in accordance with FAR 15.306(a)(2) and FAR 15.306(b)(4).  Where relevant performance record
indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness
of any implemented corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).  The Government may review more recent contracts or performance
evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.

Quality of Performance:  Assesses how well the Offeror performed.  This will be assessed based on the ratings received in the Past Performance
Questionnaires and other sources.

The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire, Attachment 4.


Evaluation of Factor III – PRICE

Price will be evaluated in terms of completeness, balanced pricing and reasonableness.

A Price reasonableness reviews will be conducted for all Offerors. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government
that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to market prices. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate
price competition, but may also be evaluated for completeness, accuracy and reasonableness using the techniques as described in FAR 15.404-
1(b)(2). The Government may evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that
pricing is not unbalanced.

The Government will evaluate price for this procurement pursuant to determining best value.  While the non-price factors are more important than
price, as the offerors become more equal in non-price merit the importance of price to the source selection will increase and price may become a
determining factor in award selection.
