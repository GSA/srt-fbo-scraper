Statement of Work (SOW)

Task Order Title:  RetrievalWare/FAST Software Maintenance and License Renewal


Background

FDA has procured an inventory of RetrievalWare/FAST software licenses.  Because the software is tied to standard system installations for the
Agency, FDA continues to require annual maintenance on the software licenses and integration with systems as patches and software is updated.
Annual maintenance includes product updates and patches and technical support from FAST technicians related to coding changes and specific code
implementations at the FDA via the Internet and telephone. FDA currently utilizes RetrievalWare/FAST Standard Support for several production
systems, some of which are considered critical applications, requiring immediate corrections.

It is expected that Retrivalware will phase out by December 2011.  FDA plans to maintain a current level of support until the end-of-life.  When
the product enters retirement in 2012, patches and upgrades are not expected, and FDA will only require internal support to maintain the
configurations per system.

Objectives


The current contract is to procure for FDA, at a fixed price, RetrievalWare/FAST Standard Support annual maintenance and licensing, for the base
year period of performance.

FDA is required to keep systems operating and require FAST technicians to assist in code changes when patches and upgrades are received.  This
includes Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 services directly with FAST technical support.

The work performed under this contract will support the FDA’s goal to maintain critical standard desktop use for FDA personnel.


Scope

The Contractor shall provide on-going maintenance support of FAST/Retrievalware software, including software patches and upgrades and FAST
development support expertise for 1 year.


   • September 30, 2009 through September 29, 2010




Specific Tasks/Deliverables

The current contract is to procure for FDA, at a fixed price, RetrievalWare/FAST Standard Support annual maintenance according to the table

Post-Award Administration

Completion of all deliverables, quality and timeliness of delivery, as well as incidents and types of defects, will be used to evaluate the
Contractor’s progress and suitability.

This document contains proprietary or procurement sensitive information related to the conduct of a federal agency procurement and shall not be
disclosed to any person other than a person authorized by the contracting officer to receive such information.

1. Agency: Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of Health and Human Services
    • a. Program Office/Center/Mail Code:  OC/OM/OCIO/IO
    • b. Project Officer/Address/Telephone Number: 5600 Fishers Ln, Rm 16B26 Rockville, MD
    • c. Contracting Activity:  OAGS
2. Nature of Action Being Proposed for Approval:
      Restriction of full and open competition
      The acquisition should be from Microsoft/FAST or a FAST Authorized Government Reseller
3. Title and Description of Supplies or Services and Estimated Value:
    • a. Project Title: FAST/Retrievalware Maintenance
    • b. Contract/Order No.
      • c. Description of supplies or services: On-going maintenance support of FAST/Retrievalware software, including software patches and
        upgrades and FAST development support expertise for 1 year.

      • d. Estimated Dollar Value:
4. Statutory Authority:
      41 U.S.C 253 (a) (1): When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the Agency’s minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique
supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.
5. Contractor's Unique Qualifications to Provide the Services or Supplies and/or Why The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority
Cited.
      Competition is restricted on this action, because the program requirements cannot be modified and the solution present from the
manufacture meets the requirements of the program.  A market analysis was done and no other manufacture could meet the requirements of the
program, FAST/Retrievalware is the only vendor that has access to FAST software modifications and technical experts to assist in problem
resolution. FAST/Retirevalware is the only vendor that has access to FAST proprietary tools developed to assist with troubleshooting and problem
diagnosis in the shortest time. FAST/Retreivalware is the only provider of authorized software patches and upgrades that are necessary to
maintain any existing warranties or maintenance agreements. Only FAST/Retirevalware authorized service providers can guarantee that
FAST/Retievalware software implementation patches that are supplied do not infringe copyrights. The lack of these abilities would produce longer
repair times and extend any down-time situation the Agency could experience due to software failure.



6. Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offers Are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources As Practicable.
      Based on past experience, with various vendors, other service vendors were not solicited for this    task for the following reasons:
         • Non-authorized providers have no right to distribute FAST/Retreivalware patches for custom system implementations.
         • Non-authorized vendors have no access to FAST/Retreivalware internal technical resources, which could increase resolution time for
           outages.
         • The current vendor is the manufacturer of the software products to be maintained and as such has a level of expertise and resources
           for maintaining the software implemtations that are unavailable from others.
         • The current vendor is the only source of certified patches, which are required to maintain any existing service contracts or system
           warranties.
7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.
        An IGCE was developed to identify the correct cost of the service requested. The contracting officer will determine fair and reasonable
pricing.
8. Description of the Market Survey Conducted and the Results, or Statement of the Reasons a Market Survey was not conducted.
      A market survey was conducted and was found that no other vendor offered a solution that would support our existing implementations.
9. Other Relevant Facts Supporting the Proposed Noncompetitive Acquisition.
      None
10. Sources that have Expressed Interest in the Acquisition in Writing.
      None
11. Statement of Actions, if any, to Remove or Overcome Barrier to Competition Before any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services.
There are no plans to compete theses requirement for the reasons specified in #5, #7 and #8.
12. Provide a statement that indicates that the use of the Justification for procuring this supply or service is not a result of a lack of
planning or the expiration of funds.
I certify that this Justification is solely intended for procuring the supplies and services from the preferred vendor because this vendor can
provide the best service to the FDA.  The funds for this procurement have been allocated from the OIM operational funds and were planned for
accordingly.
