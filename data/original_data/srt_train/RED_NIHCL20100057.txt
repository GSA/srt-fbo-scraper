(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 

(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 

(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at (b).] 

(1) Listed end products.

(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]

[  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly— 

(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or 

(2) o Outside the United States. 

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] 

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR (c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that— 

(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; 

(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR (c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and 

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 

(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 

(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 

(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (, ). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror’s relationship with the Government ().

___________________ Contractors must ensure that they comply with all applicable federal and state government regulations regarding control of infectious diseases in health care facilities.  Contractors should consult the specific regulations for further details, exemptions, documentation, and record keeping requirements.  Contractor requirements include, but are not limited to:



Rubeola - Hospital workers must have proof of rubeola (measles) immunity.  Workers born after 1956, working at least 20 hours each week, who are newly retained as medical staff, direct or contractual employees, or volunteers shall have documentation of receipt of either one dose of live measles virus vaccination or proof of immunity by blood test for antibody to rubeola.  The contractor shall keep the measles vaccination or immunity status of each worker on file.



Hepatitis B Vaccine - Workers with occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be offered the hepatitis B vaccine unless the worker has previously received the complete hepatitis B vaccination series, antibody testing has revealed that the worker is immune, or the vaccine is contraindicated for medical reasons.  Workers who decline to accept the hepatitis B vaccination must sign the mandatory declination, as specified in the OSHA standard.  The contractor shall maintain worker records for at least the duration of employment plus 30 years, in accordance with the standard.  (29  Part 1910.1030, OSHA Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens).



Universal Precautions Training - Workers with occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials must receive annual training in Universal Precautions.  For workers in the  and/or credentialed to provide patient care, this training is routinely offered by the Hospital Epidemiology Service (HES).  Contractors must either provide annual training to their employees with occupational exposure or ensure that they receive training through the HES.  Contractors must maintain training records for three years, according to the standard.  (29  Part 1910.1030, OSHA Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens).



Occupational Exposures to Blood or other Potentially Infectious Materials - Workers with occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be offered post-exposure evaluation and follow-up.  The contractor shall maintain these records for at least the duration of employment plus 30 years, in accordance with the standard.  (29  Part 1910.1030, OSHA Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens).  The NIH Occupational Medical Service (OMS) provides emergency clinical evaluation and treatment to NIH employees, non-NIH workers, and visitors on campus who report an exposure to potentially infectious materials.  If the exposure involves a primate retrovirus, OMS also offers chemoprophylaxis and serologic monitoring.  Contractors are responsible for follow-up of exposures other than those involving primate retroviruses.



Mycobacterium Tuberculosis - Workers who have the potential for occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis shall receive counseling, screening, and evaluation.  These workers include: persons who routinely have patient contact or who enter patient rooms, examination or treatment rooms whether occupied or not; persons who are exposed to M. tuberculosis in a laboratory or morgue; or persons who work in a primate animal care setting.  Workers who have positive tuberculin skin test (TST) results, TST conversions, or symptoms suggestive of TB should be identified, evaluated to rule out a diagnosis of active TB, and started on therapy or preventive therapy if indicated.  The results of pre-placement and periodic TST testing (if indicated) must be kept in a retrievable aggregate database by the  and on file by the Contractor. Contractor data must be reported to the HES as requested.  (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Guidelines for preventing the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in health-care facilities, 2005.  MMWR 54 RR 17).



Any contract employee physically working in building 10, irrespective of whether or not the individual may have occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis, must have a pre-placement TST skin test and those with positive TST must be evaluated as described above.



Varicella - Contract workers with patient contact must have a pre-placement evaluation for history of chickenpox (varicella) and/or receipt of varicella vaccine.  The contractor shall keep the varicella history and/or vaccination status of each worker on file.



Influenza – Any contractor or contractor employee physically working in building 10 from October through April, shall be required to either be immunized annually with the influenza vaccine or sign a declination form (example attached) for the current year. Records of vaccination or declination shall be kept by the contractor for a period of one year and made available to the HES upon request.  (Prevention and Control of Influenza Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 2008 MMWR /Vol 57/No. RR-7); (CC Medical Executive Committee 2008).

AND DISPOSING OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:

STORAGE:

    Records are stored in file folders and/or on microfiche, and on 

computer tapes.

 

RETRIEVABILITY:

    Records are retrieved by unit number and patient name.

 

SAFEGUARDS:

    Measures to prevent unauthorized disclosures are implemented as 

appropriate for each location and for the particular records maintained 

in each project. Each site implements personnel, physical, and 

procedural safeguards such as the following:

    1. Authorized Users: Employees maintaining records in this system 

are instructed to grant regular access only to physicians and dentists 

and other health care professionals officially participating in patient 

care, to contractors, or to NIH researchers specifically authorized by 

the system manager.

    2. Physical Safeguards: All record facilities are locked when 

system personnel are not present.

    3. Procedural Safeguards: Access to files is strictly controlled by 

the system manager. Records may be removed only by system personnel 

following receipt of a request signed by an authorized user. Access to 

computerized records is controlled by the use of security codes known 

only to the authorized user. Codes are user-and function-specific.

    Contractor compliance is assured through inclusion of Privacy Act 

requirements in contract clauses, and through monitoring by contract 

and project officers. Contractors who maintain records in this system 

are instructed to make no disclosure of the records except as 

authorized by the system manager.

    These practices are in compliance with the standards of Chapter 45-

13 of the HHS General Administration Manual, ``Safeguarding Records 

Contained in Systems of Records,'' supplementary Chapter PHS hf: 45-13, 

and the HHS Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook.

 

RETENTION AND DISPOSAL:

    Records are retained and disposed of under the authority of the NIH 

Records Control Schedule contained in NIH Manual Chapter 1743, Appendix 

1--``Keeping and Destroying Records'' (HHS Records Management Manual, 

Appendix B-361), item 3000-E-22, which allows records to be kept until

NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE:

    To determine if a record exists, write to the system manager at the 

above address. The requester must provide tangible proof of identity, 

such as a driver's license. If no identification papers are available, 

the requester must verify his or her identity by providing either a 

notarization of the request or a written certification that the 

requester is who he or she claims to be and understands that the 

knowing and willful request for acquisition of a record pertaining to 

an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the 

Act, subject to a five thousand dollar fine.

    An individual who requests notification of or access to a medical/

dental record shall, at the time the request is made, designate in writing a responsible representative who  will be willing to review the record and inform the subject individual of its contents at the representative's discretion. The representative may be a physician, or other health professional, or other responsible individual. The subject individual will be granted direct access unless it is determined that such access is likely to have an adverse effect on him or her. In that case, the medical/dental record will be sent to the designated representative. The individual will be informed in writing if the record is sent to the representative.

    A parent or guardian who requests notification of or access to a 

child's/incompetent person's record shall designate a family physician 

or other health professional (other than a family member) to whom the 

record, if any, will be sent. The parent or guardian must verify 

relationship to the child/incompetent personas as well as his/her own 

identity.

 

RECORD ACCESS PROCEDURE:

    Same as Notification Procedure. Requesters should also reasonably 

identify the specific reports and related dates pertaining to the 

information to be released. There may be a fee for reproducing more 

than 20 pages of material. Individuals may also request listings of 

accountable disclosures that have been made of their records, if any.

 

CONTESTING RECORD PROCEDURE:

    Contact the system manager and reasonably identify the record and 

specify the information to be contested, and state the corrective 

action sought and your reasons for requesting the correction, along

thereof; or (b) any HHS employee in his or her official capacity; or 

(c) any HHS employee in his or her individual capacity where the 

Department of Justice (or HHS, where it is authorized to do so) has 

agreed to represent the employee; or (d) the United States or any 

agency thereof where HHS determines that the litigation is likely to 

affect HHS or any of its components, is a party to litigation, and HHS 

determines that the use of such records by the Department of Justice, 

court or other tribunal is relevant and necessary to the litigation and 

would help in the effective representation of the governmental party 

provided, however, that in each case HHS determines that such 

disclosure is compatible with the purpose for which the records were 

collected.

    3. In the event that a system of records maintained by this agency 

to carry out its functions indicates a violation or potential violation 

of law, whether civil, criminal, or regulatory in nature, and whether 

arising by general statute or particular program statute, or by 

regulation, rule or order issued pursuant thereto, the relevant records 

in the system of records may be referred to the appropriate agency, 

whether Federal, State, or local, charged with enforcing or 

implementing the statute or rule, regulation or order issued pursuant 

thereto.

    4. NIH may disclose records to Department contractors and

    Records are stored on paper forms in file folders and on computer 

disks.

 

RETRIEVABILITY:

    Records are retrieved by name, date of birth, type of medical staff 

membership, Institute/Center and licensing status.

 

SAFEGUARDS:

    1. Authorized Users: Data on the computer network system is 

accessed by a password known only to authorized users who are NIH 

employees and contractor staff responsible for implementing the medical 

staff credentials data system. Access to information is thus limited to 

those with a need to know.

    2. Physical Safeguards: Rooms where records are stored are locked 

when not in use. During regular business hours rooms are unlocked but 

entry is controlled by on-site personnel.

    3. Procedural and Technical Safeguards: Access to files is strictly 

controlled by the system manager. Names and other identifying 

particulars are deleted when data from original records are encoded for 

analysis. Data stored in computers is accessed through a network system 

by use of a password known only to authorized users. All authorized 

users of personal information in connection with the performance of 

their jobs (see Authorized Users, above) protect information from 

public view and from unauthorized personnel entering an unsupervised 

office.

Technology Enhancements

After contract award, the Government may solicit, and the Contractor is encouraged to propose independently, enhancements to the hardware, software, services, features, or other requirements of the contract.  These enhancements may be proposed to save money, to improve performance, to save energy, or for any other purpose which presents an advantage to the Government. 

Enhancements proposed under this shall:

Meet, at a minimum, all mandatory requirements;

Be compatible with other hardware or software on the contract;

Maintain or improve network performance;

Facilitate or maintain ease of maintenance or ease of use; 

Offer a price/performance ratio at least equivalent to or superior to the price/performance ratio of the hardware being replaced with no impact on the terms and conditions of the contract;

Incorporate any changes to deliverable documentation or training necessary as a result of the enhancement at no additional cost to the Government; and

Be supportable for the life of the contract.

As part of the proposed changes, the Contractor shall submit a price proposal to the Contracting Officer for evaluation.  Those proposed enhancements that are acceptable to the Government will be processed as modifications to the contract.

As a minimum, the following information shall be submitted by the Contractor with each enhancement proposal:

A description of the difference between the existing contract requirement and the proposed change, and the comparative advantages and disadvantages of each;

An itemized list of contract requirements which must be changed if the proposal is adopted, and the proposed revisions to the contract for each such change (with associated technical data); 

An estimate of the changes in performance and cost, if any, that will result from adoption of the proposal;

An evaluation of the effects that the proposed changes would have on collateral costs to the Government, such as Government-furnished property costs, costs of related items, and costs of maintenance, operation and conversion (including Government premises property), if any;

A statement of the time by which the contract modification adopting the proposal must be issued so as to obtain the maximum benefits of the changes during the remainder of this contract, including supporting rationale;

An analysis of the effect on the contract completion time or delivery schedule, if any;

A certification that any new items introduced as a result of the enhancements are compatible with other items on the contract or with hardware interface requirements specified in the contract; and

Standard Form 1411 or 1412 pricing data, where required, and/or any other information required by the Contracting Officer to adequately evaluate the proposal.

The contracting officer’s technical representative (COTR) designated in accordance with the contract shall be provided with one of each of the proposed hardware or software enhancements for evaluation.

The Government will not be liable for proposal preparation cost or any delay in acting upon any proposal submitted pursuant to this provision.  The Contractor has the right to withdraw, in whole or in part, any proposal not accepted by the Government within the period specified in the proposal.  The decision of the Contracting Officer as to the acceptance of any such proposal under this contract is final and not subject to the "Disputes" clause of this contract.

If a proposal submitted pursuant to this provision is accepted and applied to this contract, the resulting contract modification shall cite paragraph H.8 as the authority under which the changes are being made.  When the cost of performance of this contract is increased or decreased as a result of the proposed change, an equitable adjustment in contract price shall be negotiated pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties.  The acceptance of any technology change proposal submitted pursuant to this clause shall be executed by a written, bilateral modification of the contract.  Unless and until a bilateral modification is executed to incorporate the technology enhancement under this contract, the Contractor shall remain obligated to perform in accordance with the terms of the existing contract.


INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS


GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

INTRODUCTION

The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and contents of proposals.  Special attention is
directed to the Proposal Response Instructions for Technical and Business proposals.

   1. Contract Type and General Clauses

        It is contemplated that a fixed price type contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  Any resultant contract shall
        include the clauses applicable to the selected Offeror's organization and type of contract awarded as required by Public Law, Executive
        Order, or acquisition regulations in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract.

        2.  Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal

        The proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind your organization and must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the
        terms and conditions of this RFP. Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the addressees, and marked as indicated in
        the Attachment entitled, PACKAGING AND DELIVERY OF PROPOSAL. Proposals shall be typewritten, paginated, reproduced on letter size paper
        and will be legible in all required copies. To expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should
        be placed in the order specified in the Proposal Response Instructions.


3. Alternate Proposals

        You may, at your discretion, submit alternate proposals, or proposals which deviate from the requirements; provided, that you also submit
        a proposal for performance of the work as specified in the statement of work.  Such proposals may be considered if overall performance
        would be improved or not compromised and if they are in the best interests of the Government.  Alternative proposals, or deviations from
        any requirements of this RFP, shall be clearly identified.

   4.  Evaluation of Proposals

        The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in Attachment No. 7 to this combined
        synopsis/solicitation.

   5.  Potential Award Without Discussions

        The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussion if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial prices
        are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.

   6.  Use of the Metric System of Measurement

        It is the policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to support the Federal transition to the metric system and to use the
        metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants, and other business related activities unless such use is impracticable or is
        likely to cause significant inefficiencies.


        The Offeror is encouraged to prepare their proposal using either "Hard Metric," "Soft Metric," or "Dual Systems" of measurement.  The
        following definitions are provided for your information:

             Hard Metric - The replacement of a standard inch-pound size with an accepted metric size for a particular purpose.  An example of
             size substitution might be: selling or packaging liquids by the liter instead of by the pint or quart (as for soft drinks), or
             instead of by the gallon (as for gasoline).


             Soft Metric - The result of a mathematical conversion of inch-pound measurements to metric equivalents for a particular purpose.
             The physical characteristics are not changed.


             Dual Systems - The use of both inch-pound and metric systems. For example, an item is designed, produced, and described in inch-
             pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison purposes.

   7.  Privacy Act

        The Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information, the
        authority which authorizes the solicitation, whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, the principal purpose or purposes for which
        the information is intended to be used, the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information, and the effects on the
        individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.


        The NIH is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Sec. 301(a)(7) of the Public Health
        Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.


        Providing the information requested is entirely voluntary. The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an
        accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.

        Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.


        In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following          information be provided when
        individuals are requested to disclose their social security number.


        Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and efficient
        identification, referral, review and management of NIH contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is provided by
        Section 301 and Title IV of the PHS Act, as amended.


              The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:

             - to the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Office for auditing.


             - to the Department of Justice as required for litigation.


             - to respond to congressional inquiries.


             - to qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees, for opinions
             as a part of the review process.

     8. Selection of Offerors

           a)    The acceptability of the technical portion of each contract proposal will be evaluated by a technical review committee.  The
                 committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity with the evaluation criteria of the RFP, utilizing point scores and
                 written critiques.  The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an offeror.

           b)    The business portion of each contract proposal will be subjected to a cost and price analysis, management analysis, etc.

           c)    If award will be made without conducting discussions, Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their
                 proposal (e.g., the relevance of an Offeror's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the
                 Offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors.


           d)    If the Government intends to conduct discussions prior to awarding a contract-


                 1. Communications will be held with Offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from
                 being placed within the competitive range. Such communications shall address adverse past performance information to which an
                 offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond. Also, communications may be held with any other Offerors whose exclusion
                 from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain.








                 Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal deficiencies or omissions that alter the technical or cost elements of
                 the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal, but may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of establishing
                 the competitive range.

                 2. The Contracting Officer will, in concert with program staff, decide which proposals are in the competitive range. The
                 competitive range will be comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals. Oral or written discussions may be conducted with
                 all Offerors in the competitive range.

                 While it is the Government’s policy to conduct discussions with all Offerors in the competitive range, the Government reserves
                 the right, in special circumstances, to limit the number of proposals included in the competitive range to the greatest number
                 that will permit an efficient competition.


                 All aspects of the proposals are subject to discussions, including cost, technical approach, past performance, and contractual
                 terms and conditions.  At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror still in the competitive range shall be given an
                 opportunity to submit a written Final Proposal Revision (FPR) with the reservation of the right to conduct finalization of
                 details with the selected source in accordance with HHSAR 315.370.

            e)   The process described in FAR 15.101-1 will be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and
                 non-cost factors and to consider award to other than the lowest price offeror or other than the highest technically rated
                 offeror.  This process will take into consideration the results of the technical evaluation, the past performance evaluation (if
                 applicable) and the cost analysis.

            f)   The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all to the RFP.  In addition, the RFP
                 may be amended or canceled as necessary to meet the Government’s requirements.  Synopses of awards exceeding $25,000 will be
                 published in the Federal Business Opportunity.

     9. Past Performance Information

           a) Offerors shall submit the past performance information required under the Past Performance Summary Section of the Proposal
           Response Instructions.  The offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the Offeror's
           corrective actions.

            b) The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the Offeror.

    10. Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference, FAR 52.252-1 (Feb 1998)

           This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given
           in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  The offeror is cautioned that the listed
           provisions may include blocks that must be completed by the Offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer.  In lieu of submitting
           the full text provision, the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with
           its quotation or offer.  Also, the full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address:

Technical Evaluation Criteria/Method of Review

     Evaluation Criteria


Evaluation of the Offeror’s proposal is a three-step process.

Step 1 – Mandatory Requirements Evaluation
Step 2 – Technical Proposal Evaluation
Step 3 – Cost Proposal Evaluation

STEP 1 - MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS EVALUATION

In order for a proposal to receive any consideration, the mandatory requirements stated in Section 3.1.1 – 3.1.19 must be fully met.

Failure to adequately document compliance for any of the mandatory requirements will result in the elimination of the Offeror’s proposal from
further consideration. The proposal will be considered to be non-responsive and the Offeror will be disqualified.

STEP 2 - TECHNICAL PROPOSAL EVALUATION

The Technical Requirements, Sections II, III, and IV specify the detailed requirements of the Government.  The detailed requirements in
Attachment 16 – Sections 3.2.1 – 3.2.465 and 3.3.1 – 3.3.13, are weighted as Critical, Highly Desirable or Value Added.

Critical - Critical requirements are the most highly rated elements because they have been identified as extremely important to users in terms
of their internal workflow or patient care responsibilities.

Highly Desirable - Highly desirable requirements have been judged significant by users in terms of their internal workflow or patient care
responsibilities and their inclusion would be expected to improve productivity, efficiency or customer satisfaction.

Value Added - Value added requirements are desirable, or considered nice to have, but are not critical to patient care or process improvement.

Responses to the Detailed Technical Requirements in Attachment 16 – Sections 3.2.1 – 3.2.465 and 3.3.1 – 3.3.13 will be rated according to one
of four possible states, and will be assigned points based on that specific rating for each element.

 • The highest score will be given for those requirements, identified in the SOW, that have been developed, tested, installed and are currently
   in operation at a client site(s) as a part of the system proposed by the Offeror.  (Response = GA)
 • A lower score will be given for those requirements, identified in the SOW, that have been developed, tested and will be delivered to the NIH
   as a part of the initial software install, but are not currently in operation at a client site(s) as a part of the system proposed by the
   Offeror.  (Response = NI)
 • An even lower score will be given for those requirements, identified in the SOW, that are not currently available as a part of the system
   proposed by the Offeror, but are planned for in a future release over the next 12 months or will be custom built for the NIH by the Offeror.
   (Response = CD)
 • No score will be given for those requirements, identified in the SOW, that are not currently available as a part of the proposed system, that
   are not currently planned for a future release over the next 12 months and are not considered likely candidates for a custom build solution.
   (Response = NA)

Responses to the Detailed Requirements in Attachment 16 – Sections 4.2 – 4.7 will be rated strictly on whether or not the feature is currently
available as a part of the system proposed by the Offeror. Points will be awarded if the feature is currently available and no points will be
awarded if it is not.

In addition, detailed narratives are required to five specific areas within the Technical Requirements of the SOW:  Section 3.3: Server
Hardware, Related Peripherals, Sublicenses and Software; Section 3.4: Development; Section 4.2: Technical and Environmental; Section 4.5:
Interfaces; and Section 4.6: Ancillary Specific Infrastructure.   Each narrative will be evaluated and scored separately.  Points from each
narrative will be included in the Offeror’s total score for the technical proposal evaluations.  Offerors are encouraged to satisfy the POPIDS
technical requirements without additional development to the highest extent possible.  The Government will evaluate the response to Section 3.4:
Development and assign higher points for less development.

The Implementation Services will be evaluated based on the Offeror’s responses to the Implementation Requirements in the SOW, specifically
Section V, including the practicality, realism and completeness of the Offeror’s approach to an implementation of functions desired by NIH.
 • The comprehensiveness of the implementation plan in addressing activities, critical paths, resources and budget for the Pharmacy Outpatient
   Information and Dispensing System (POPIDS) project.
 • The realism of the proposed approach to staffing personnel in sufficient quantities to support the implementation plan.  The degree to which
   the Offeror efficiently utilizes NIH personnel resources.  The degree to which the Offeror maximizes the utilization of the staff and
   subcontractor resources.
 • The comprehensiveness of the project management tools utilized by the Offeror to ensure performance of the tasks under this procurement.
 • The adequacy, clarity, and completeness of the technical configuration to address the needs of the Clinical Center.
 • The feasibility and comprehensiveness of the Testing and Acceptance Plan proposed by the Offeror
 • The feasibility and comprehensiveness of the Data Administration approach.
 • The comprehensiveness, clarity, and ease of use of the COTS vendors’ documentation.
 • The degree to which the Offeror demonstrates the ability of proposed key personnel to perform in the roles defined for the project management.
 • The feasibility and comprehensiveness of the implementation plan
 • The feasibility and comprehensiveness of the quality assurance and quality control management measures for resources, scheduling and
   deliverables.

The Training Services will be evaluated based on the Offeror’s responses to the requirements in the Training requirements in the SOW,
specifically in Section VI, including
 • The adequacy, thoroughness, and innovative approach proposed by the Offeror in the training of users, informatics and technical staff and the
   plan’s effective and optimal use of training resources.
 • The proposed methodology for customization of the training material to the NIH environment to accommodate initial implementation and ongoing
   training needs.
 • The comprehensiveness of the Training Plan to address the training needs of the defined users.

The Maintenance and Upgrade Approach will be evaluated based on the Offeror’s responses to the requirements in the Maintenance and Upgrade
requirements SOW, specifically in Section VII, including
 • The comprehensiveness of the services proposed in the ongoing system support and maintenance plan.
 • The feasibility and impact on NIH of the COTS vendors plans for communicating, distributing and implementing new releases.
 • The agreement to comply with HIPAA standards and other mandatory federal standards as they are released.
 • The comprehensiveness of plans to enhance COTS application modules.
 • The degree of user and technology orientation of COTS vendor’s approach to enhancing the products.
 • The roles and scope of activities of the client user group in recommending product enhancements.
 • The feasibility and comprehensiveness of the procedures employed by the Offeror to identify risk and select the best approach to mitigating
   the risk.

The Corporate Capabilities will be evaluated based on the Offeror’s responses to the questions in Corporate Capabilities - Attachment 7:
 • The degree to which the Offeror demonstrates the availability of personnel with the necessary skill sets to support the requirements of NIH.
 • The degree to which the Offeror and subcontractor(s) demonstrate the organizational capability and resource availability necessary to perform
   the proposed work.
 • The general market availability and penetration of the system/modules proposed by the Offeror.
 • The capabilities of the Offeror and subcontractor(s) to provide the implementation and maintenance services required by NIH.
 • The depth of corporate facilities and technologies.
 • The experiences of the Offeror and subcontractor(s) in recruiting and retaining clients.
 • The role of clients and users in their ability to influence product capabilities and affect change, e.g. Product User Group (s).

The Past Performance will be evaluated on the basis of the combined Offeror's and proposed subcontractors, technical  and  managerial  experience
and performance in providing integrated systems and related support services consistent in scope and complexity to that required in the SOW.  The
Offeror shall submit a list of references that are representative in nature to the products and services required in the SOW.  In  addition,  the
Offeror will be required to forward copies of the Past Performance Questionnaire – Attachment 6 to references for a specified  set  of  products.
The information provided shall address contracts performed within the past three years.

 • The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated on the relevance of the performance documented in the submitted Past Performance Summary and
   Client Reference checks including:
         o The experience of the Offeror in successful management of contracts of similar size and scope as that required by NIH.
         o Evidence of comparable and related work experience within the last three years, including scope of contracts, complexity of site,
           implementation of required products, applicable technology, required interfaces to be implemented, and adequacy of staffing.
         o The degree to which the Offeror demonstrates experience in successfully providing or performing statement of work requirements for
           other clients.
         o The degree to which the Offeror demonstrates the quality of products and services provided (i.e., compliance with contract
           requirements, technical excellence).
 • The degree to which customer satisfaction is evident through information provided in review of the Government past performance database, Past
   Performance Questionnaires and in telephone interviews with selected Client References.
         o The quality of Offeror's services.
         o The Offeror's record of containing cost and accurately forecasting costs (cost control).
         o The Offeror's adherence to contract schedules (timeliness of performance) including the administrative aspects of contract
           performance.
         o The Offeror's overall business relationships with its clients and subcontractors.
         o The Offeror's overall ability to provide customer satisfaction.
 • The degree to which the Offeror has had sufficient experience with HL7 and other industry standard interfaces.
 • The degree to which the samples of similar work satisfy the presentation, completeness, format and adaptability to NIH documentation and
   reporting requirements.
 • Additionally, the degree to which laudatory business practices and customer satisfaction are evident through receipt of quality awards,
   letters of appreciation, or similar individual or corporate recognition of successful contribution to a contract/order, Offeror’s receipt of
   positive feedback, follow-on business, award/incentive fees, letters of recommendation, referrals, etc. will be considered.

The proposal evaluation will include past performance references for teaming partner(s), subcontractors or joint venture partner(s) that  provide
a significant contribution to the  effort  (significant  is  defined  as  10%  of  the  overall  effort  or  revenue).   For  the  experience  of
subcontractors, teaming partners or joint venture partners to be considered, the arrangements must be identified and company relationships  fully
disclosed in the proposal.  Firms whose proposals are based on teaming arrangements that do not provide a signed teaming  agreement(s)  with  the
firm(s) that have been proposed will receive an unacceptable evaluation for this factor.  Past performance for third party providers will not  be
considered for this factor.

Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an Offeror, as an organization, has successfully met its  customer’s  requirements  and  the
extent to which the customer is satisfied with the Offeror’s performance.    Information  will  also  be  considered  regarding  any  significant
subcontractors.  If discussions are conducted, Offerors in the competitive range will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable  reports  of
past performance, if the Offeror has not had a previous opportunity to review the rating.

In evaluating past performance, the Government will consider the available  information  and  give  it  such  weight  as  it  deems  appropriate.
Favorable and unfavorable references for an Offeror will not be averaged.  One unfavorable reference, if deemed by the Government to be  reliable
and relevant to performance of the solicited products and services, may be the  basis  for  a  negative  evaluation  notwithstanding  other  more
positive information.  Conversely, a reliable and relevant favorable reference may be given substantial weight in a  positive  evaluation.  Firms
lacking relevant past performance history will be given a neutral rating.

STEP 3 – COST PROPOSAL EVALUATION

Cost will be evaluated and will be worth a maximum of 2,000 points, with the remaining 10,755 points allotted to the Technical  Evaluation.   The
Government will review the overall costs of each Offeror's proposal to determine if the costs  are  realistic  for  the  work  to  be  performed,
reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the Offeror's technical proposal.  In  evaluating  cost  proposals,  a
risk assessment of unrealistic rates may be considered in  making  the  source  selection  decision.  Unrealistically  low  costs/prices  may  be
indicative of a lack of understanding of the technical requirements and/or a lack of commitment to provide uninterrupted high quality work.

The prices offered in each technically acceptable proposal included in the competitive range will be totaled and compared. Points will be
awarded according to the following formula:

Lowest Price  X # available points=cost points assigned Offeror’s price

The Government reserves the right to deduct points if the proposed pricing method for “other expenses” is adjudged to be excessive. This
deduction will not exceed a total of 5 points. It is noted that points are merely a guide for source selection and the mathematical outcome is
not necessarily determinative of the awardee.

Because adequate competition is anticipated, cost and pricing data is not being requested at this time other than the Cost Tables  in  Attachment
2.  The Government reserves the right to request such information at a later date if necessary.




Invoice Submission:   Invoices may be submitted upon completion and acceptance by the Government of each phase of this project (e.g. User Acceptance Testing,  Final System Acceptance Testing), etc. as well as completion of other required services (e.g. training and maintenance).
