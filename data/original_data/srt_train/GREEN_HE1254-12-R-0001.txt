|This GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements|
|associated with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government solicitations, to be      |
|filled out by solicitation respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the         |
|applicable Section 508 requirements.                                                                                             |

|NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible     |
|Wizard. Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on    |
|possible EIT requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program           |
|requirements for this acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has    |
|physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond      |
|identified program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information.      |

|The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products,    |
|corresponding to the six technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information,          |
|documentation, and support as defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables correspond to     |
|accessibility information about information content deliverables and labor hours, respectively.                                  |

(a) The Contractor shall update the information in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) on a semi-annual
basis, throughout the life of the contract, by posting the required information in the Central Contractor Registration database via
https://www.acquisition.gov.

(b) As required by section 3010 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 (Pub. L. 111-212), all information posted in FAPIIS on or after
April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews, will be publicly available. FAPIIS consists of two segments--

(ii) Information that was entered prior to April 15, 2011; or

(iii) Information that is withdrawn during the 14-calendar-day waiting period by the Government official who posted it in accordance with
paragraph (c)(1) of this clause.

(c) The Contractor will receive notification when the Government posts new information to the Contractor's record.

(1) If the Contractor asserts in writing within 7 calendar days, to the Government official who posted the information, that some of the
information posted to the non-public segment of FAPIIS is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the Government
official who posted the information must within 7 calendar days remove the posting from FAPIIS and resolve the issue in accordance with agency
Freedom of Information procedures, prior to reposting the releasable information. The contractor must cite 52.209-9 and request removal within 7

                                                                STATEMENT OF WORK

1.0   INTRODUCTION

1.1   The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees by
providing PK-12 instruction to approximately 87,000 students in seven states, twelve foreign countries, Guam, and Puerto Rico.  The number of
learners varies based on the deployment of military troops worldwide.  DoDEA has approximately 7,500 teachers worldwide.  DoDEA’s curriculum,
resources, and student achievement scores on standardized assessments compare favorably to high-performing US public schools.

1.2   DoDEA is divided into three administrative areas.  DDESS (Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools) covers the schools in seven
states and Puerto Rico, and for administrative purposes, Cuba.  DoDDS (Department of Defense Dependent Schools) is divided into DoDDS-Europe and
DoDDS-Pacific.  The former administers the schools in England, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and Bahrain.  The
latter covers the schools in Korea, Japan, and for administrative purposes, Guam.  DoDEA also operates a fully accredited Virtual High School
with its main office in Virginia and with teaching hubs in Germany and Korea.


2.0   BACKGROUND

2.1   DoDEA currently uses the Blackboard 9.1 LMS to support a mix of approximately 25,000 student faculty and staff accounts  worldwide.   DoDEA
intends to expand it’s LMS resources to additional students, faculty and staff in order to accommodate the growing number of requests for  online
instructional tools.


3.0   SCOPE

3.1   DoDEA requires an enterprise-wide, K-12 focused LMS for its students and educators, which will replace the current DoDEA LMS for the
development and tracking of online curricular content.  DoDEA requires a contractor-hosted production and test environment.

3.2   The LMS will provide an online presence in classrooms in both its brick-and-mortar and virtual schools.  As the LMS is core to the
classroom presence for teachers operating in the DoDEA Virtual High School, the adopted system will include a robust set of content creation,
instruction and assessment tools to both replicate and extend modalities found in a traditional classroom environment.

3.3   The Contractor will provide: (1) services to assist DoDEA Information Technology (IT) staff with the planning, migration, and
implementation of all user accounts, roles, courses, and content currently contained in DoDEA’s LMS environment; and, (2) services and resources
to train all faculty and above school level personnel in the technical, functional and administrative functions of the new LMS.


4.0   REQUIREMENTS

4.1   The LMS shall, at minimum, have the following features and operational functions.  The LMS will primarily serve DoDEA students, faculty
and staff, with the potential of serving additional DoD dependents around the world.  Since pricing models may vary, DoDEA requests the system
be able to accommodate a range of 8,000 to 25,000 active users.  The system should be robust enough to scale as the user population grows.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Technical, Past Performance; and  Price. The order of importance of these factors are: Technical, Past Performance and Price. When combined,
Technical and Past Performance are significantly more important than Price, and Technical is more important than Past Performance.

      1)    Only those offers determined to be Acceptable, Good, or Outstanding, as defined below, either initially or as a result of
discussions, will be considered for award.

      2)    Evaluation Criteria.  The following are the evaluation criteria for each factor :

FACTOR 1 – TECHNICAL.

Vendors will be evaluated on how well they demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement as set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW) as
well as on the general quality of the proposed products and services. Further, emphasis will be placed on the proposed materials’ ease of usage
and how well the proposed web-hosted environment functions.

OUTSTANDING (O) – The proposal demonstrates a superior understanding of the requirements and a new or proven approach that significantly exceeds
performance or capability standards.  The proposal has several exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the government.  The
proposal has no weaknesses.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will be sufficient to minimize risk.  The proposal is
extensive, detailed, and exceeds all requirements and objectives; therefore, has a high probability of meeting the requirements with little or
no risk to the government.

GOOD (G) – The proposal demonstrates a considerable understanding of the requirements and the approach exceeds performance or capability
standards.  The proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit the government.  Any proposal weakness has little potential to cause
disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will
probably be able to overcome difficulties.  The proposal generally exceeds requirements in minor areas; therefore, has a strong probability of
meeting the requirements with little risk to the government.

ACCEPTABLE (A) – The proposal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the requirements and the approach meets all performance or capability
standards.  The proposal has no strengths that exceed the requirement.  The proposal has no material weaknesses.  The proposal has some weakness
that can potentially cause disruption of schedules, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.  Special contractor emphasis and close
government monitoring will minimize any risk.  The proposal meets the minimum requirements; therefore, has an acceptable probability of meeting
the requirements

MARGINAL (M) – The proposal fails to meet performance requirements and capability standards in one or more areas.  The proposal has minor
omissions and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement that may be corrected or resolved through discussions without a complete
revision of the entire proposal.  The proposal has weaknesses that can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or
degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis, and close government monitoring.

UNACCEPTABLE (U) – The proposal fails to demonstrate a basic understanding of the requirements and the approach fails to meet performance or
capability standards.  The proposal has major omissions and inadequate details to assure the evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of
the requirements.  The proposal presents an unacceptable risk and cannot meet the requirements without major revisions.


FACTOR 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE.

      (1)   Overview.  In determining past performance risk, the evaluators may employ the following approaches:  (ii) reviewing the present and
 past performance documentation required by Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 and provided by the offeror as to the relevancy to the solicitation
 requirements; and (ii) using data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.  In determining risk, judgment will be
 used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the
 requirements.

      (2)   The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the
Offeror's ability to perform this effort.  The tradeoff process will result in an overall risk rating of low, medium, high or neutral. This risk
assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an Offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort
based on the Offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.

      (3)   Past performance will take into consideration past efforts similar in type and size to that stated in this solicitation.  In other
words, in evaluating the proposal, strong emphasis will be placed on the record of past performance for jobs of comparable size and complexity
and similar technical requirements.  Consideration will be given to the degree to which the offeror has met technical and response objectives on
other efforts.

      (4)   Performance Risk Definitions.     The following definitions will be used in the evaluation of the degree the offeror will
satisfactorily perform the required services based on his past and current performance records.
      High Risk (H) - Verification of past performance shows that offerors have consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, have
defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or have chronically failed to meet contract terms.
      Medium Risk (M) - Verification of past performance shows that offeror meets work schedules and specified services most of the time, meets
contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years.
      Low Risk (L) - Verification of past performance shows that offeror consistently meets work schedules, provides specified services, meets
contract terms without failure, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years.
      Neutral / Unknown Performance Risk (N).  No record of past performance.

      (5)   The Government may reject a proposal if it is found that any information that has a negative impact on the offeror's past
performance record has been deleted, misrepresented, or withheld.




















FACTOR 3 - PRICE.

      1)    Price may be traded off against the increased value of the other factors.  If the other factors are rated the same for two or more
proposals, price may be the determining factor for the proposal representing the Best Value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained
in this acquisition, and award shall be made to the offeror, subject to a positive responsibility determination.

      2)    Prices will be analyzed in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b).  The proposed prices will be evaluated separately from technical and past
performance factors for fairness and reasonableness for all years (base plus options) in terms of consistency with the technical approach.

      3)    In determining reasonableness of price, evaluation will review prices and take into consideration that proposed prices reflect a
clear understanding of work to be performed, consistency with the technical requirement for all years and indicates reasonableness of prices for
services.

      4)    The total evaluated price must be reasonable and any additional expense must be justified by a corresponding value of technical merit
or an expectation of greater quality or performance.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

EXHIBIT A
                                                               SUBCONTRACTING PLAN
                                              INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSING AN INITIAL COMMERCIAL ITEM



TYPE OF PLAN -- Any large business that does not have an approved small business subcontracting plan must submit a proposed plan to the
Contracting Officer.  This plan, when submitted, is a proposed Commercial Item Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  It is the preferred type of
subcontracting plan for this procurement, though the quoter/offeror may use a noncommercial plan instead.  Commercial plans are good for the

the contract involved, but must be renegotiated for each contract requiring a plan.

PLAN SUBMITTAL -- An offeror submitting a proposed commercial plan must submit it to the first Contracting Officer awarding a contract subject
to the plan during the Contractor's fiscal year.  This proposed plan must be submitted as part of the offer.  If that Contracting Officer is a
DoDEA Contracting Officer, the plan must have at least the information shown on the following pages.  Offerors submitting plans to DoDEA are
requested to use the format shown on the following pages in their submittal.  Plans already approved must be included in the offer.  An approved
commercial plan is generally valid for one year from the date of acceptance of the contract and is applicable to all other Government contracts.


IDENTITY OF THE SUBCONTRACTING PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR -- Before a plan is approved, the offeror is requested to provide the name of the
individual employed by the offeror who will administer the contractor’s subcontracting program.   This identity information should include the
name, title, address and telephone number (as well as e-mail address, if known) of the subcontracting program administrator.

PLAN START AND END DATES -- The proposed plan must specify the first and last dates when this plan will apply.  If the format on the following
pages is used, this is the "Period Covered By Plan."  The Contracting Officer will specify the starting date.  The offeror must specify the
ending date.  The ending date must be the last day of the offeror's current fiscal year.  If that ending date is fewer than 30 federal
government working days from the starting date, the offeror must either (a) fill in the ending date with the last date of the Contractor's next
fiscal year, or (b) complete the Commercial Item Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Renegotiation/Renewal) in addition to the plan.  (Using the
ending date of the offeror's next fiscal year is usually much simpler.)  Ensuing plans will coincide with the contractor's fiscal year.

REASONABLE GOALS -- The offeror must select goals that are reasonable based on making good faith efforts (to be described in this plan) to use
small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, service disabled veteran owned small business, and women-owned small business subcontractors to the
maximum extent practicable.  Contracting Officers will reject plans with unreasonably low goals, or efforts described herein that are not good
faith efforts.

QUESTIONS -- Should offerors have any questions regarding subcontracting plans, they should contact the DoD Small Business Specialist for this
solicitation/contract.
