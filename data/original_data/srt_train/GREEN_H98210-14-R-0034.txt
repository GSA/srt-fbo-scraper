STATEMENT OF WORK

                                       Hewlett Packard Hardware/Software Maintenance Renewal Consolidation

1.  INTRODUCTION:  The Defense Civilian Personnel Advisory Service (DCPAS) requires maintenance and support for Hewlett Packard (HP)
hardware/software utilized in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS).

2.  BACKGROUND:  DCPAS is responsible for the sustainment of the DCPDS which provides Human Resource information system support for the
Department of Defense’s (DoD) civilian workforce worldwide.  DCPDS currently consists of 95% HP products and the enterprise utilizes HP servers,
superdomes and associated components along with HP software as part of a large complex architecture.  It is essential that HP maintain the
equipment during all installation efforts to provide a consistent change procedure to the hardware and software, and provide the necessary
critical support required during these actions.  There would be a significant risk to a warranty and support to the existing environment if
there is no direct relationship with HP for support/service verification and entitlement of critical support services for systems in the
production site.

The production facility Denver Data Center (DDC) houses the Corporate Management Information System and provides an enterprise-level warehouse
of records from all 19 DCPDS Regional Service Centers in addition to other production projects supporting DCPDS.  Support of our DCPDS
architecture at the DDC requires Critical Care, which includes 24X7 support with a 6 hour call to repair, for the equipment and its components
around-the-clock.  The development/test facility, located in San Antonio, TX (SATX), requires multiple levels of support.  The SATX DCPDS
facility’s development/test environment supports numerous applications such as, Customer Support Unit, System Qualification Testing and other
special projects to be tested and evaluated.  Since our migration to the Itanium platform, DCPDS has deployed additional HP equipment into the
architecture to coincide with any future projects or to enhance the continued performance of DCPDS.  In addition, a disaster recovery site
located in Alpharetta GA, has been established and requires HP maintenance support level to ensure the production enterprise architecture can be
supported during any disaster.  All of the DCPDS facilities provide critical functions in supporting DCPDS and its customers around the world.

3. SCOPE:   The contractor shall provide maintenance support for HP software/hardware products located in San Antonio TX, Denver CO and
Alpharetta GA.

4. REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall:

4.1. Provide proactive and reactive maintenance and support, HP Support Plus 24, and                    HP Proactive 24 for the HP orders and HP
SAIDs identified in table 4.2 below, which are identified by the referenced attachment number.

Note:  DCPAS continually procures new HP equipment that is integrated into the production environment. Maintenance support requirement must be
met at 100% performance, six hour call to repair and immediate dispatch at the DDC.  The DDC facility is a 24 hour facility which requires
equipment and software support at all times where the SATX and the Disaster Recovery (DR) facility must be maintained at a level sufficient to
continue provide the support necessary during any emergency actions.  Any degradation to HP equipment support at either facility would severely
immobilize the overall productivity of DCPDS.


6.1 The end user and point of contact is for our service integrator in the event electronic transfer of information  is  required.    Maintenance
support must be provided on time, to ensure DCPDS will not be without support and susceptible to information technology infrastructure  problems.

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA,
the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American
statute. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer
determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the
solicitation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
principals—

(1) ( ___   ) Are, ( ___   ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by
any Federal agency; and

(2) ( ___   ) Have, ( ___   ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state
or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or
Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating
Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) ( ___   ) Are, ( ___   ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission
of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) [ ___  ] Have, [ ___  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)
