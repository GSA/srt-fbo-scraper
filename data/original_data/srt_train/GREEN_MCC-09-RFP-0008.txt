MCC PERFORMANCE MONITORING ACTIVITIES

The MCC will continuously evaluate the contractor's performance in accordance with the performance standards and measurements provided in the contract. When an observation indicates defective performance under the terms of the contract, the MCC will require the contractor's Project Manager (PM) to acknowledge notification of the deficiency by signing and dating the written record of the observed deficiency.

Any action taken by the MCC as a result of monitoring/surveillance will be in accordance with the terms of the contract. In addition to any deductions for poor performance, upon receipt of notification from MCC of a performance deficiency, the contractor shall take immediate steps to remedy the cause of the problem. The contractor shall meet with the MCC COTR and provide a detailed plan to remedy the performance issue within 5 working days, and shall provide ongoing reports to document progress during the corrective period. E.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)

A Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan is established in paragraph 7.1 of the SOW. The QASP will be used by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as a part of the contract administration and monitoring activities conducted to ensure that the Government receives products and services that conform to contract requirements. The Contractor's Self-Monitoring of Performance reports in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) will be used as a tool by the Government to assess the contractor's performance.

Each officer or employee of the Contractor and any of its subcontractors to whom any Government data may be made available or disclosed shall be notified in writing by the Contractor that information disclosed to such officer or employee can be used only for that purpose and to the extent authorized herein. Further disclosure of any such information, by any means, for a purpose or to an extent unauthorized herein, may subject the offender to criminal sanctions imposed by 18 U.S.C. 641. That section provides, in pertinent part, that whoever knowingly converts to their use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys, or disposes of any record of the United States or whoever receives the same with intent to convert it to their use or gain, knowing it to have been converted, shall be guilty of a crime punishable by a fine of up to $10,000, or imprisoned up to ten years, or both.

13 MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) has added pertinent coverage in the form of Part 1194 to Chapter XI of title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

H.4 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (OCI)

The Contracting Officer has concluded that this acquisition may give rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest. Accordingly, the attention of the Contractor is directed to FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest. In order to prevent or mitigate organizational conflicts of interest which may bias the Contractor's judgment or objectivity in executing service under this contract, or that might give the Contractor an unfair competitive advantage in current or future MCC procurements, the following conditions apply to this contract: (a) The Contractor agrees that its entire organization, including divisions, affiliates, subsidiaries and parent organizations, is bound by, is aware of, and will comply with these restrictions. (b) In the performance of work under this contract, the Contractor and/or its Subcontractor(s) shall have access or the capability to access MCC sensitive and for official use only data, proprietary data of other companies, and privacy act data. The Contractor and its Subcontractor(s) agree to protect such data from unauthorized use or disclosure. The Contractor and its Subcontractor(s) having the capability to access MCC data shall not be permitted to compete or propose on any MCC (including MCA) acquisitions for the duration of this contract, and for two (2) years after its expiration. The only exception is the re-competition of this contract, and only if the contractor can demonstrate appropriate segregation and firewalls can be established between operations personnel and capability to access MCC data and the management, capture, business development, and proposal team. (c) The Contractor and its Subcontractor(s) must thoroughly inculcate in its employees, through formal training in company policies and procedures, an awareness of the philosophy of Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.5 to the end that they will be disciplined in the absolute necessity of refraining from divulging to anyone not authorized MCC sensitive or for official use only data, proprietary data, trade secrets, confidential information or sensitive or restricted data from MCC or other companies received in connection with work under this contract. (d) The Contractor and it Subcontractor(s) must obtain from any employee having the capability to access to MCC data under this contract, a written agreement which shall in substance provide that such employee will not, during his employment by the Contractor or thereafter, disclose to others or use for his own behalf, MCC data, proprietary data, trade secrets, confidential information, or restricted data received in connection with the work under this contract. (e) The Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer within 3 calendar days if performance of a particular service under this contract may result in a potential organizational conflict of interest. Upon being so informed, or if the Contracting Officer independently identifies the potential organizational conflict of interest, the
14 MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Contracting Officer shall determine which of the following is in the best interests of the Government and so advise the Contractor; (1) the Contractor shall perform consistent with the order; (2) the Contractor shall not perform that order, the order shall be canceled, and work identified in the order shall be obtained by the Government from another source; or (3) the Contractor shall identify a subcontractor who can provide services consistent with the order. The Contractor shall enter into a subcontract and retain all contractual responsibilities except that the subcontractor technical reports shall be delivered directly to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative and the Contracting Officer. This subcontract will not obviate the Contractor's responsibility for acceptable performance of the order. (f) The term "Contractor" as used means the business entity receiving award of this contract, including parent companies, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries. (g) The term "contract" as used shall include extensions thereof and successor contracts performed or to be performed by the Contractor without there being any other contractor intervening. (h) The term "development" means all effort towards solution of broadly defined problems. This may encompass research, evaluation of technical feasibility, proof of design and test or engineering of programs not yet approved for acquisition or operation. (i) The term "proprietary information" means all information held in confidence or disclosed under restrictions to prevent uncontrolled distribution. Examples include limited or restricted data, trade secrets, sensitive financial information, or computer software and may appear in cost and pricing data or involve classified information. (j) The above restrictions shall apply to all subcontracts, teaming arrangements, and other agreements calling for performance of work which is subject to the organizational conflict of interest restrictions identified in this clause, unless excused in writing by the Contracting Officer. (k) The Contractor shall include paragraphs (a) through (k) in every subcontract. H.5 MCC 52.204-71 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL (MAR 2006) Contractor employees and/or subcontractor personnel, while on MCC premises, shall be subject to and abide by all safety and security regulations of the MCC and shall be required to meet the same personnel security background requirements as MCC employees as outlined in MCC policies and procedures.

Contractor Personnel Facility Access Requirements (including offsite MCCNet access) Contractor personnel hired to work under contracts awarded by Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and require access to MCC Headquarters, MCCNet, Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU), Foreign Government Information (FGI) or other MCC-Sensitive information shall be U.S. citizens or have permanent resident status. Contractor personnel will undergo screening (background investigation) for this access. The screening will
15 MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

determine the individual's suitability and fitness for work under MCC contracts. The background investigation will consist of a National Agency Checks with Law and Credit (NACLC) for public trust positions. Permanent Residents must have been in the country for a sufficient amount of time for the investigation results to be meaningful, usually five (5) but a minimum of two (2) years. Contractor is required to have all effected personnel execute appropriate security forms (SF 85P, Fingerprint Charts, Releases) and submit to MCC's Security Office before access to the facility or MCCNet is approved. Contractor personnel may work under the contract while the background investigation is being conducted. MCC Security Office will provide the necessary forms to the contractor. (Also see "Contract Award" below.) Contractor personnel for whom unfavorable or derogatory information has been developed during the background investigation process will be presented to the person by MCC's Security Office and offered an opportunity to refute, explain, clarify or mitigate the information in question. If an ineligibility determination is made by MCC's Security Office, the individual will be ineligible to further render services under the contract and access to the facility and/or MCCNet will be immediately terminated. The ineligibility decision will be communicated by the MCC Security Office through the contracting officer and COTR to the contractor. The specific reasons for the ineligibility determination will be made available only to the effected individual directly by the MCC's Security Office. MCC will honor a previous investigation meeting or exceeding the MCC required investigation standard (NACLC) that was completed within the previous two years. Contractor personnel may be required to submit updated security forms. B. Contract Employees Not Requiring Facility, MCCNet, or Sensitive Information Access Contractor personnel hired to work under this contract awarded by Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and do not require access to MCC Headquarters, shall be U.S. citizens or have permanent resident status. The contractor must provide to MCC's Security Office the full name, date of birth, place of birth, social security number and home address. MCC may use this information to screen contractor personnel through various government databases to determine their suitability and fitness for work under MCC contracts. Additional forms and background information may be requested to verify their suitability. Contractor personnel may work under the contract while the background investigation is being conducted. Contractor personnel on whom unfavorable, derogatory or questionable information has been developed will be given an opportunity to refute, explain, clarify or mitigate the information with MCC's Security Office. If an ineligibility determination is made by MCC's Security Office, the individual will be ineligible to further render services under the contract. The ineligibility decision will be communicated by the MCC Security Office through the contracting officer and COTR to the contractor. The specific reasons for the ineligibility determination will be made available only to the effected individual directly by the MCC's Security Office. C. Contractor Personnel Security Clearance Requirements The number of contractors cleared for access to classified information will be kept to a minimum, based on operational needs requiring the individual to access classified information or systems. The level of access approved will relate directly to the level of classified information the individual has a need to access.
16 MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

1. Personal Service Contractors and Independent Contractors. MCC is responsible for security clearance actions associated with individuals who are directly compensated by MCC. MCC will request investigations and grant as appropriate, security clearances for Personal Service Contractors and independent contractor (including purchase orders) with individuals where MCC makes payment directly to the individual. The level of investigation and clearance granted will be based on the duties performed as compared with the position of an MCC employee in a similar position. Contractor is required to execute appropriate security forms (SF 86, Fingerprint Charts, Releases) and submit to MCC's Security Office before access to the facility or MCCNet is approved. Contractor may work under the contract while the background investigation is being conducted. MCC Security Office will provide the necessary forms to the contractor and process the background investigation and approve the clearance. 2. Secure Contract Classification. Classified contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements with organizations must comply with the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). Under the provisions of NISP, the Defense Security Service (DSS) will investigate and adjudicate security clearances required for contractor employees to have access to classified information. Organizations (contractors and recipients) and their employees not currently participating in the National Security Industrial Program (NISP) and wishing to conduct classified business with MCC must be sponsored by MCC, another agency, or by company that has been previously cleared. Once the secure contract is awarded, MCC Contracting Officer, in consultation with MCC's Security Office, will be responsible for completing the Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification, DD Form 254. D. Exceptions to Investigations Requirements Contractors are exempt from investigative requirements when working in temporary low risk positions that are intermittent and when not working on an MCC contract in excess of 180 days in either a single assignment or a series of assignments. Low risk positions involve duties and responsibilities of limited impact on an agency or program mission, with potential for limited impact on the efficiency of the service. Persons occupying these positions will not have unescorted access to the Department of State or its Embassies, Sensitive But Unclassified, Foreign Government Information, MCC-Sensitive information, or require logon access to MCC's computer information network. E. Issuing MCC Access Badges MCC Access Badges are issued by the Security Office to new employees, and personal service contractors and other contractors with permanent duty station assignment at MCC Headquarters. Requirements before being issued a badge include submission of required security forms for processing a security clearance or facility access, and mandatory attendance at an MCC security briefing. Security briefings are scheduled on the first business day of the pay period and alternate weeks as determined by MCC's Human Resources, and are generally held from 8:45 to 10:00 am. MCC Visitor Badges (escort not required) are temporarily assigned by the Security Office immediately after these requirements are met, pending processing of MCC PhotoIdentification Badges. Contractors with the appropriate level background investigation and who are United States citizens may be eligible for 24/7 access to MCC headquarters. Foreign national with the appropriate level background investigation and issuance of an MCC Access Badge, will only be provided unescorted access during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 7:30 am to 6:30 pm, excluding holidays and other MCC closings).

17 MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Contractor employees who have not submitted the required security forms and attended the MCC security briefing will not be issued MCC Access Badges and their access to MCC headquarters will require them to have an appointment and be escorted at all times while in MCC headquarters. F. Contract Award Within two (2) business days after notice of award from the contracting officer, contractor shall provide a listing of all personnel (and subcontractor personnel) working under the contract (unless otherwise stated in the contract) including the information and documentation required herein. This requirement does not include clerical or administrative support staff (unless otherwise stated in the contract). The listing shall include individual's full name, date of birth, place of birth, social security number and home address. This listing shall state whether or not the individual will need a security clearance, MCC facility access, access to non-classified sensitive information, MCC Net access, or no access privileges. In addition, the contractor will provide a central point-of-contact regarding personnel security issues. The contracting officer will send a copy of the listing and point-of-contact to the MCC Security Office. It is the MCC Security Office's responsibility to furnish the necessary form and initiate appropriate security action with the contractor's pointof-contact. Once the forms have been provided to the contractor and/or employee, it is the contractor's responsibility to assure that all requested information is submitted within ten (10) business days. H.6 REMOVAL OF CONTRACTOR'S EMPLOYEES The Contractor agrees to use only responsible, and capable people to perform the work. The Contracting Officer may require that the Contractor remove from the job, employees who endanger persons or property, or whose continued employment under this contract is inconsistent with the interest of MCC security. H.7 EXCLUDED PARTIES LIST The Contractor shall notify MCC within 24 hours of being included in the Excluded Parties List consisting of entities debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, excluded or disqualified under the non-procurement common rule, or otherwise declared ineligible from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain Federal assistance and benefits.

The Offeror' Volume 2 ­ Past Performance. References will be compiled based on the 0-5 rating scale in Attachment C. The MCC will then further rate each offerors references overall as follows: Rating High Risk Definition Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring. Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties. Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties. No relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction. A search was unable to identify any relevant past performance information for the Offeror or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment.

In the period prior to the compact signing, the accountable entity is typically a unit within a recipient country's government (also referred to as the Country Counterpart within this document). After the compact signing, an accountable entity's official name is determined, for example, MCA-Country, Millennium Challenge Country or other name. Advance ­ Cash outlays made by a federal entity to its employees, contractors, grantees, or others to cover a part or all of the recipients' anticipated expenses or as advance payments for the cost of goods and services the entity acquires. Examples include cash or other assets disbursed under a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement before services or goods are provided by the contractor or grantee.

Agency Locator Code (ALC) ­ Unique numeric symbol assigned by the Treasury Financial Management Service (FMS) used for reporting purposes.
Apportionment ­ An action by which OMB distributes, or divides, amounts available to MCC for obligation (from its appropriation) for its Administration (category a), and Programs (category b).

Custodial Account ­ A pass-through account for interest accrued on the monies held in each 609(g) or compact permitted account. The FSP disburses funds monthly for select 609(g) Agreements and Compacts to cover projected needs, over a forthcoming three-month period. Such funds provided to the countries are required to be deposited in interest-bearing, U.S. dollar-denominated permitted accounts, if legally feasible, until re-disbursed. The interest earned on these accounts is remitted to a custodial account that is administered by the FSP in order to be deposited into a U.S. Treasury account. Interest may not be retained or used by MCC, but periodically is returned to the Treasury's general funds. De-obligation ­ A cancellation or downward adjustment of previously incurred obligations from a completed obligating instrument (contract, purchase order, IAA, grant etc.) and restoring those funds to apportionments or allowances (i.e., funds available for obligation). This process is typically done upon completion of activities when unspent ("unliquidated") obligations may no longer be needed for the original purpose.

The obligation is reduced as payments ("liquidations") are made.

Non-Expenditure Transfers (NETs): MCC delegates the management and execution of its Threshold programs to USAID. MCC transfers two types of money to USAID and other governmental agencies to support Threshold programs. MCC allocates and transfers funds to USAID via NETs. The allocated funds are administration service fees for USAID oversight of the Threshold programs. The transferred funds are provided to the Threshold countries, and managed by USAID. The service provider must account for these two types of funds separately.
Permitted Account(s) ­ The interest-bearing dollar-denominated account (if applicable) and local currency-denominated account (Local Account), established at a MCC approved bank in the recipient country and administered by the Fiscal Agent on behalf of the accountable entity. The financial service provider advances funds to the Local Account, or another Permitted Account as agreed by MCC, via a Non-US Bank Payment Form with the Recipient Name denoted as Accountable Entity-Country (Local Account). Payments made from this account are reported back to MCC and the FSP via the Quarterly Financial Report (QFR). Procurement Agent ­ The entity contracted by the Accountable Entity responsible for certain aspects of administering the procurement process in adherence to the MCA procurement guidelines. Project ­ A specific project, policy reforms, and other activities that the MCA country carries out to achieve the 609(g) objectives and activities.

Re-disbursements ­ A payment by the Fiscal Agent of compact or 609(g) funds from the permitted account to the Accountable Entity's external vendors, employees and other recipients in the MCA country, once services are provided, goods received and works are rendered. At the end of each quarter, the Accountable Entity includes information on re-disbursement amounts into a QFR so that the financial service provider can liquidate the previously recorded advance in the core financial system. Secure Payment System (SPS) ­ This system is comprised of two parts: (a) an application that allows the financial service provider to input summary payment information which is then certified by a Certifying Officer, and (b) a portal to allow detailed payment information to transfer from Core financial system to FMS.

ATTACHMENT B MCC FMBCS TEST SCENARIOS
FUNDS MANAGEMENT (FM) SCENARIOS ˇ Scenario FM01: Budget Appropriation

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor will record the appropriation and fund categories in the General Ledger. Background: MCC has only one appropriation. MCC's programs and activities are funded through no-year appropriations. Such funds are available for obligation without fiscal year limitation and remain available until expended. The Department of Treasury automatically issues warrants to MCC upon enactment of annual appropriations bills. Because of the no-year status of MCC appropriations, unobligated administrative, audit, and due diligence funds (apportioned annually) are not returned to the Treasury; however, unobligated balances as of September 30 for these three categories of funds are transferred to the compact fund category at the beginning of the subsequent fiscal year for future use. Detailed Scenario Information: The Annual Appropriations Bill is signed by the President and approved by Congress. MCC was provided total appropriations of almost $1.8 billion in FY 2007. Treasury issues a warrant specifying the Treasury Account Symbol and amount of $1.8 billion to MCC. The SF-132 Apportionment and Reapportionment schedule is received by MCC's Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) that details elements such as the appropriation amount, agency name, fiscal year(s) of appropriation, transfers, Treasury Account Symbol, reimbursable amounts, and apportionment amounts by quarter. The MCC Accountant records the one year direct appropriation and notifies the Budget Officer when finished. ˇ Scenario FM02: Apportionment

Requirement: Demonstrate how the CONTRACTOR will record the apportionments in the General Ledger. Background: MCC requests apportionment of its appropriated funds from OMB using OMB's governmentwide standard Apportionment and Reapportionment Schedule form (SF-132). Prior to submission to OMB, MCC's Budget Office works with MCC's Office of the General Counsel (OGC) and Department of Congressional and Public Affairs (CPA) to process Congressional Notifications for each new Compact and Threshold program. The SF-132 form is prepared and submitted to OMB for each of its budget accounts by August 21st of each year or within 10 calendar days of approval of the appropriation. MCC submits reapportionment requests to OMB for program funds throughout the year as new Compacts, 609(g), or Threshold program agreements are signed, or as otherwise needed. The form must be completed and signed by OMB before MCC may obligate or disburse any appropriated funds. After OMB's approval, the MCC Accountant processes the apportionment and an accounting event will be posted to the General Ledger. Category A of MCC's SF-132 includes MCC's apportionment for administrative expenses. These funds are apportioned on a quarterly basis, up to MCC's appropriation act limit. The Senior Budget Officer submits SF132s to OMB on a quarterly basis for administrative funds apportionments. Category B of MCC's SF-132 includes MCC's apportionments for the following: 1
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation ˇ Compact Programs: funds obligated by MCC to cover compacts between MCC and partner countries. The total amount of assistance provided to all lower middle income Compact countries may not exceed 25 percent of the total amount of assistance provided to all countries in a particular fiscal year, under section 605 of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003. 609(g) Programs: section 609(g) of the Millennium Challenge Act authorizes MCC to provide assistance to eligible countries for the purpose of facilitating the development and implementation of a Compact between the MCC and a partner country. Due Diligence Programs: funds apportioned by OMB and used by MCC to cover costs to assess Compact proposals, as well as costs incurred by MCC in providing oversight and monitoring of Compacts being developed and implemented by eligible countries. Threshold Programs: funds used by MCC to assist countries in meeting selection criteria for MCA eligibility. (Such countries are considered "on the threshold" of qualifying for eligibility for an MCC compact.) up to 10 percent of the total amount appropriated in a given fiscal year may be made available to provide assistance to certain candidate countries under the Threshold Program. USAID's OIG: Funds appropriated by Congress and apportioned by OMB for audits of MCC operations and programs. The USAID OIG is responsible for MCC audits. This apportionment has a Congressional limit of up to $5,000,000 established in MCC's annual appropriation.

Category C of MCC's Apportionment schedule reflects unapportioned balances from current and prior year appropriations. Detailed Scenario Information Category A Total Apportionment amount of $105 Million for FY 2008: During the budget formulation process, MCC's Budget Office requests apportionments for administrative expenses of its appropriated funds from OMB by submitting an Apportionment request on the SF-132 to OMB for $26,250,000 for each quarter. OMB approves MCC's apportionment request. After receiving the $26,250,000 per quarter on the SF-132 schedule, MCC's Budget Officer records the apportionment. After the OCFO processes the apportionment, an accounting event will be posted to the General Ledger. Category B Total Apportionment amount of $2.895 Billion for FY 2008: MCC's Senior Budget Officer submits all requests for Category B apportionments, identifying amounts for: 1. Total Amount for Compact programs of $2,620 billion 2. Total Amount for Due Diligence and 609(g) of $80 million 3. Total Amount for Threshold Programs of $190 million 4. Total Amount for USAID's OIG of $4.5 million After the OCFO processes the apportionment, an accounting event will be posted to the General Ledger. Category C Total Apportionment amount of $2.3 Billion for FY 2008: This represents MCC's unobligated balances from current and prior year appropriations. ˇ Scenario FM03: Committing and Obligating MCC Funds

Requirement: Demonstrate how the CONTRACTOR will record the commitment and obligation in the General Ledger for the scenarios detailed below.

2
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation Background: MCC only records commitments against appropriated and apportioned funds; the Division of Finance ensures the availability of funds in MCC's apportionment accounts prior to recording commitments in the financial system. Commitments and obligations of MCC funds include amounts for (1) rent, leaseholds and improvements; (2) contracted services; (3) grants to, and cooperative agreements with, nongovernmental organizations or international public organizations5; (4) information technology; (5) travel; (6) other administrative expenses; (7) Compacts; (8) 609(g) activities; (9) Due Diligence activities; and (5) the Office of Inspector General (OIG) activities. Detailed Scenario Information 1. Administrative/Due Diligence Funds: MCC's Administrative Services Facilities manager issues a requesting action memo to purchase office supplies in the amount of $2,000. The requesting action memo is reviewed and approved by the Managing Director (MD), Administrative Services and sends it and the related procurement package to the ACFO and the Department of Contracts and Grants Management for review and approval. Upon approval, the procurement package is recorded as an obligation in the financial system. 2. Compact Funds: Demonstrate how the CONTRACTOR will record a commitment for the total amount of a Compact between MCC and the country of Latvia for $1,000,000 after the Compact is "signed". Demonstrate how the CONTRACTOR will record an obligation for the total amount of a Compact between MCC and the country of Latvia after the Compact "enters-into-force". Compact signing is a commitment of funds, while Compact entry-into-force constitutes a valid obligation. 3. 609(g) Funds: Demonstrate how the CONTRACTOR will record a commitment and obligation for the total amount of 609(g) funds of $9,800,000 for the country of Tanzania. 4. Threshold Funds: These funds are separate from Compact/609(g) funds and are frequently allocated and or transferred to USAID, which currently functions as the primary implementer and administrator of the Threshold program. This allocation includes a transfer of the percentage of funds to USAID to cover administrative costs. MCC utilizes the Government Wide Accounting (GWA) system for processing Non-expenditure Transfer Authorizations through Treasury to USAID. Demonstrate how the CONTRACTOR will record a commitment and obligation for the allocation of $9,000,000 in program and $1,000,000 in administrative funds to USAID as the administrator of the Threshold program. 5. Audit Activities: USAID's OIG serves as MCC's OIG. The OIG prepares an estimated budget for the fiscal year, which is reviewed and approved by the MCC Board of Director's Audit Committee, verified by the ACFO and submitted to OMB for apportionment. Once approved, MCC records the total amount in the core financial system as an obligation, which is then liquidated upon reimbursement of quarterly invoiced amounts from USAID via IPAC. Demonstrate how the CONTRACTOR will record a commitment and obligation for the $2,800,000 audit funds for FY 2007. ˇ Scenario FM04: Rollover

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor will roll-over any unobligated MCC administrative funds to MCC's program funds budget at the end of each fiscal year. 3

Scenario FM05: Funds Flow Down

Requirement: Demonstrate how the proposed CONTRACTOR facilitates the funds flow down for Category A, B, and C apportionments for a representative sample of MCC's appropriations as well as the Administrative Budget allotments for FY 2008. Background: MCC's annual budget formulation and planning process involves the formulation of the budget at the department level. The Senior Budget Officer consults with senior MCC staff on the issuance of all approved funding plans and allotments for review and approval. MCC also ensures concurrence by CPA and OGC personnel on all reprogramming, restructuring, and appropriation transfers. MCC reprograms, restructures, and transfers funds; processes requests for rescissions and deferrals, as necessary, for MCCs appropriation. MCC prepares and issues allotments that are within authorized appropriation, apportionment, reimbursement, and other limits. Detailed Scenario Information The Office and Management Budget (OMB) and MCC have determined the following apportionments for FY 2008. Demonstrate the funds flow down for the following apportionments: Program Category A ˇ Administrative Expenses ˇ Inspector General Category B ˇ Compacts ˇ Threshold ˇ Due diligence/609(G) Total Appropriation/Request FY 2008 $ 105,000,000 $ 4,500,000 $ 2,620,000,000 $ 190,000,000 $ 80,000,000 $ 3,000,000,000

In addition, Category C in the amount of $ 1,516,900,216, which represents the total amount of unobligated funds available at the end of FY 2007 that are rolled over into FY 2008. 4

Scenario FM06: Continuing Resolution

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor will record on-going, as well as prospective programs during multiple extensions of a CR when the House and Senate "Marks" differ for an on-going program, but both Houses mark the program for less than prior year FY 2007 actual funding. Background: A Continuing Resolution (CR) continues funding for a program if the fiscal year ends without a new appropriation in place. A CR provides temporary funding at current levels or less. In the event of a continuing resolution, OMB issues a bulletin to all executive branch agencies, including MCC, providing an automatic apportionment of funds pursuant to instructions in the bulletin. Detailed Scenario Information Part 1: For existing MCC Programs funded in prior years. Assume the following: The FY 2007 annual MCC appropriations bill is not signed by the President and Congress. Therefore, Congress approves a continuing resolution for the next forty days in the total amount of $328,767,000 (40/365* 3,000,000,000 last year's (FY2007) budget amount) to MCC. An MCC Accountant records the continuing resolution amount and notifies a MCC Budget Officer when finished. Part 2: (For proposed MCC Programs not funded in prior years. Assume the following: MCC has requested $12.5 million in Threshold funds for a new Threshold agreement between MCC and the Country of Peru in the FY 2008 President's Budget request. MCC receives appropriations from the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Acts enacted by Congress on an annual basis. During the Congressional negotiations to pass a final MCC Appropriations Act, the Committee on International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate differ on the proposed FY 2008 funding for Peru's Threshold program. The "House Mark" proposed FY 2008 funding for Peru's Threshold program at $10 million; a reduction from the President's Budget of $2.5 million. The "Senate Mark" proposed FY 2008 funding for Peru's Threshold program was $8 million; a reduction of $4.5 million from the amount in the President's Budget Request for FY 2008. Ultimately, the two versions are reconciled in conference, and Peru's Threshold program was funded at $10 Million for FY 2008. 5

Millennium Challenge Corporation ˇ Scenario FM07: Funds Control

Requirement: Demonstrate/Discuss what controls are involved in the Contractor's processes to prevent a Revised Statute Violation at the Appropriation level. Demonstrate/Discuss the flexibility provided by the CONTRACTOR to any MCC Budget Officer or Department Head to establish controls at the appropriation, apportionment, program, project, or activity level to prevent commitment, obligation, and expenditure of funds in excess of those authorized at a particular level. Lastly, demonstrate/discuss how the CONTRACTOR will facilitate applying the controls at any designated budget- level. Background: MCC Officials perform the following duties relating to Budget Execution and Funds Control: (1) Perform administrative control of funds during the budget execution process; (2) Perform administrative control of funds designed to restrict obligations and expenditures (disbursements) to the amount available in MCC's appropriations or OMB apportionments;(3) Identify persons responsible for any obligation or expenditure exceeding amounts available in MCC's appropriation, OMB apportionment or reapportionment, other statutory limitations, internal allotment or allowance, and any other administrative subdivision of funds; and (4) Address violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act, as well as violations of other administrative sub-division of funds that are not statutory violations. If an alleged Anti-Deficiency Act violation is reported, the DCFO reviews the violation report and determines if one has occurred prior to submitting it to the MCC CFO for concurrence. If the CFO concurs, the violation is then reported to the President and Congress by the MCC CEO after clearance by MCC's OGC and CPA. The following is an organizational chart depicting assumed funding levels from the Program level to the task level.

Millennium Challenge Corporation ˇ Scenario FM08: Reconciling Funds Balance with the Treasury (FBWT)

Requirement: Demonstrate how the CONTRACTOR will facilitate, efficiently in an automatic manner, reconciling differences between MCC and Treasury records for any fund balance at a given point in time. Discuss and explain how the Contractor will reconcile (any specified) Fund Balance with the Treasury (FBWT). Lastly, discuss and explain how the Contractor will record and report 6655 transactions, and reconcile them with the General Ledger. Background: MCC Officials are required to reconcile Fund Balance with Treasury (FBWT) accounts with comparable balances contained in the Department of Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) records. This reconciliation is essential to enhancing internal controls, improving the integrity of various U.S. Government financial reports and providing a more accurate measurement of budget results. The FBWT account is an asset account that consists of all funds on deposit with Treasury, excluding seized cash deposited, and reported on the Statement of Transactions, Statement of Accountability and the Year-end Closing Statement. MCC and other Federal agencies use the FBWT account to record appropriation, receipt, transfer and disbursement activity. MCC and all Federal program agencies (FPAs) reconcile their Fund Balance With Treasury (FBWT) account balances using the following Treasury reports: ˇ ˇ ˇ FMS 6653: Undisbursed Appropriation Account Ledger FMS 6654: Undisbursed Appropriation Account Trial Balance FMS 6655: Receipt Account Ledger/Trial Balance

In prior FYs, MCC accessed these Treasury reports through the Government On-Line Accounting Link System (GOALS II/IAS) application on the 7th business day of each month. Effective June 30, 2006, FMS discontinued the use of the FMS 6653 and FMS 6654 in the GOALS II/IAS application and replaced these reports with the Government-Wide Accounting (GWA) Account Statement application. Account Statement application presents appropriation warrants and intra-governmental non-expenditure transfers, payments, and deposits that affect MCC's fund balance. Transactions received by FMS during working hours will be available on the appropriate Account Statement requested during the next business day. The GWA Account Statement lists expenditure accounts that have had activity during the course of the monthly report period, including transactions reported by MCC on its SF-224, and transactions reported by other agencies that affect MCC's fund balance by appropriation symbol. MCC continues to access the FMS 6655: Receipt Account Ledger data via GOALS II/IAS. MCC records FBWT activity in the U.S. Standard General Ledger (SGL) Account 1010 and any related subaccounts. Detailed Scenario Information A MCC Accountant reconciles the FBWT and clears reconciliation differences and errors between Treasury and MCC's General Ledger balance. The MCC GL has the following balances in the 1010 accounts: 1010-00 Fund Balance With Treasury 1010-04 Collections- Travel Advances 1010-22 SF-224 Disbursements- NFC Payroll

The MCC Accountant logs into Treasury's GOALS II system and enters the GL balances into the on-line SF224 report and documents the amounts for later reconciliation. The MCC Accountant downloads the Treasury cash balances for MCC from the Treasury Government Wide Accounting (GWA) system. The balance indicated by Treasury and the balance on MCC's GL are compared and reconciled. Differences in the account balances are researched to identify the specific transactions that make the cash balance differences. The FBWT reconciliations will be performed for MCC's Agency Location Code (ALC) 95-77-0000, which represents a disbursement, and/or collections center, customer, and Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) - 95X2750 - General Funds. For ALC 95-77-0000 and TAS 95X2750 General Fund, there is a difference of $5,000. The MCC Accountant had created a Journal Voucher (JV) earlier to offset the $5,000 balance to the General Fund3220.077 General Fund Proprietary Receipts Not Otherwise Classified All Other. ˇ Scenario FM09: Management Alerts

Requirement: Demonstrate/Discuss how the Contractor will alert MCC Officials to Appropriation, Apportionments, Funds, and Programs where the commitment, obligation, and/or expenditure rates cannot be sustained at present levels through fiscal year end. Background: MCC's Senior Budget Officer or his/her designee performs the following Budget Execution procedures: 1. Processes MCC requests for apportionments and reapportionments 2. Submits apportionment and reapportionment requests (SF-132) to OMB 3. Reviews quarterly Statement of Budgetary Resources (SF-133) for accuracy prior to its transmittal of SF-133s to OMB 4. Provides periodic reports to departments on variance between expenditures and budget allotments and allowances 5. Provides analyses of resource allocations to DCFO and CFO 6. Provides timely notification to responsible MCC officials when an allotment or allowance is likely to be exceeded 7. Reviews and clears all Congressional Notifications from MCC's Department of CPA to confirm availability of budgetary resources. MCC's Senior Budget Officer regularly reviews and prepares budget status reports that reflect up-to-date MCC obligation and expenditure amounts. The Senior Budget Officer analyzes variances between the budgeted allotments and allowances, and commitments, obligations and expenditures and distributes copies of applicable reports to MCC's Vice Presidents, Managing Directors, or designees. MCC's accounting system also enables the preparation of financial and budgetary reports that display cumulative obligations and the remaining unobligated balance and cumulative obligations by budget activity and object class codes. 9

GENERAL ACCOUNTING (GA) SCENARIOS ˇ Scenario GA01: Direct Accounting Adjustments

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor makes direct accounting adjustments. Demonstrate the Contractor's controls over the process. Detailed Scenario Information Scenario A: After running a trial balance report, the MCC Accountant notices that there is $9,000 debit balance in SGL account 4700 Commitments. The normal balance of SGL account 4700 Commitments is credit. After researching the transaction that caused this abnormal balance, the MCC Accountant determines that a general journal entry needs to be created to reverse out the erroneous posting. As part of the general journal entry the following data needs to be captured: Date, Description, Accounting Classification Code Structure, Amount, Debit Account number, Credit Account Number, and Fiscal Year. Scenario B: The DCFO ensures that the asset management system calculates depreciation and amortization expense over the MCC standard useful lives for general PPE. Depreciation or amortization charges are calculated (using the straight-line method) and recorded at the end of each quarter of the fiscal year for each capital acquisition received, accepted and placed into use by that date. The MCC Accountant records depreciation expenses in MCC's financial system. During the quarterly review and reconciliation of asset balances in the asset management system with the asset balances in the general ledger system, the MCC Accountant noticed a difference of $22,917 in depreciation expense in the asset management system when compared to the corresponding asset balance in the general ledger system. The difference was due to the asset management system incorrectly calculating depreciation expense on a computer system costing $275,000, with a useful life of 3 years that was purchased in March 2008, but placed into service on June 2008. ˇ Scenario GA02: Contractor Debarment and Suspension List

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor uses contractor debarment and suspension list to prevent new obligations for those contractors affected.

 10 
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation Detailed Scenario Information Ace Computer Service, Inc. did business with MCC in FY 2007. Ace Computer Service, Inc. was placed on MCC's contractor debarment and suspension list from FY 2008 until November 2, 2009 for serious violations of contract terms, and failure to pay damages associated with contract breach. Ace Computer Service, Inc. is one of 125 contractors on MCC's contractor debarment and suspension list. On December 2, 2007, the MCC Country Director for Cape Verde prepares a Purchase Request and Commitment (PR&C) document obligating FY 2008 funds in the amount of $50,000 to purchase selected items from Ace Computer Service, Inc, and forwards the Purchase Request to his supporting MCC contracting officer. The Country Director for Cape Verde is not finance or contracting specialist and is unaware that Ace Computer Service, Inc. defaulted on a contract with MCC and has been placed on the contractor debarment and suspension list. Demonstrate how the internal controls in the proposed Contractor's processes will ensure that the $50,000 commitment that The Cape Verde Country Director initiated on December 2, 2007 cannot turn into an contractual obligation (contract with) Ace Computer Service, Inc any time before the Debarment period ends (November 2, 2009). ˇ Scenario GA03: Modifying a Service Contract

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor facilitates modifying a service contract by adding additional obligation authority, and adding additional services (contract line items). Detailed Scenario Information Scenario 1: A MCC Accountant determines that a previously issued requisition for a new computer server contains an amount that will not cover the server's actual costs. The requisition amount needs to be increased by $20,000. The amended requesting action memo amount noting the $20,000 increase is forwarded to the designated program office official for approval. Since a contract has entered into the financial system using the modified requisition number appended with a .1 on the end of the document number. The Contracting Officer signs the procurement documents (i.e. contracts, purchase orders, task orders and other documents), thereby authorizing obligation of MCC funds. The Contracting Officer ensures procurement documents include payment and other terms (such as specifying when payment is due, the conditions under which payments are made and discount terms, if any). This includes electronic funds transfer (EFT) clauses or provisions in contract awards, as appropriate. The amount of the requisition is the difference between the previous amount and revised amount ($20,000). The requisition package is then emailed to the contract specialist team for processing. The contract specialist reviews the package for correctness, completeness, checks the requisition in the financial system, and sends requisitions that have passed the review forward to the Sr. Procurement Officer for modification. Requisitions that do not pass the review are sent back to the program office with the reason for rejection. Scenario 2: Assume the facts and information above, except that instead of the a contract amount increase related to the purchase of a computer server, the action memo is requesting an additional contract increase of $100,000 to purchase new computer hardware for the IT department. ˇ Scenario GA04: Transactions From Feeder Systems  11 
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation Requirement: Discuss how the Contractor will map MCC specific program/project dollars with the performance data in the MIDAS performance database. Background: MCC utilizes the MCC Integrated Data Analysis System (MIDAS) interface for the collection of data contained in Quarterly Financial Reports (QFRs) from each compact country's fiscal agent. Detailed Scenario Information The examples below are hypothetical and do not reflect actual data or relationships. 1. The following Project funds for the Compact country of Benin will be mapped to multiple project objective and outcome statements in MIDAS. a. Benin's Land Project = $36 million would tie to 3 outcome statements Strengthen i. Property Rights and Investments ii. Reduced time and cost to obtain a title iii. Reduced number of land disputes 2. The following Activity funds for the Compact country of Benin will be mapped to multiple output statements in MIDAS. a. Benin's Land Project = $36 million i. Policy Activity = $1.3 million 1. $300,000 tied to drafting legislation 2. $500,000 tied to 14 stakeholder events held 3. $500,000 tied to X number of community leaders trained and demonstrate a comprehension of the new law. ii. Registration Activity = $10 million 1. $4 million tied to the preparation, issuance and recording of land titles 2. $5 million tied to the creation of cadastral mapping (includes surveying) 3. $1 million tied to community outreach iii. Other Activities = Remaining funds." ˇ Scenario GA05: Inter-Department Order

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor will process an Inter-Departmental order for goods or and services by MCC from another Federal Agency, including the use of Threshold Program fund for purchases of goods and services. Background: MCC has delegated USAID to administer its Threshold Program. USAID records the status of Threshold program funds (obligations, disbursements, receivables, and other data) in GWA, which is consolidated into OMB's MAX system. USAID also provides quarterly trial balance reports to MCC. MCC does not record USAID's Threshold program transactions in its financial system as USAID does so in the GWA system. In addition, MCC, through an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) with the Department of State, funds M CC's overseas operations. The Department of State provides MCC with SF ­ 1221, Statement of Transactions and Overseas Operations listing transaction amounts processed against foreign currency accounts, which are accounts established by the Department of the Treasury for reporting of transactions related to foreign  12 
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation currencies acquired without expenditure of U.S. dollars. As part of the SF - 1221, the Department of State also provides a detailed listing of transactions (processed vouchers and collection documents) called Voucher Audit Detail Reports (VADRs) or SF - 1167, Voucher and Schedule of Payments. As part of the Fund Balance with Treasury reconciliation policies and procedures, MCC performs a reconciliation of data in its financial system to the SF - 1221 and SF - 1167 reports from the Department of State and the balance reported in the GWA system. Detailed Scenario Information Scenario 1: In October of 2008, MCC provides a Threshold program allocation to USAID of $2,000,000 associated with the Threshold Program for the county of Săo Tomé and Principe. This allocation is treated as a Treasury NET Authorization by completing and submitting a SF - 1151 to Treasury, and recording an allocation under the appropriate USSGL accounts. USAID obligates the funds in accordance with the memorandum of agreement, after MCC's Board of Directors authorizes Threshold program assistance for a given country. At the end of the first quarter 2008, USAID reports the order and payment of goods and services on behalf of Săo Tomé and Principe's Threshold Program in the amount of $192,000 broken down as follows: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Personal Service Contractors Office Equipment Computer Equipment Training $150,000 $ 2,000 $ 25,000 $ 15,000

Scenario 2: MCC, through an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) with the Department of State, funds M CC's overseas operations relating to MCC's Compact Program with the Kingdom of Morocco. The Department of State provides MCC with SF ­ 1221, Statement of Transactions and Overseas Operations listing transaction amounts totaling $55,000 processed against foreign currency accounts. The SF - 1221, is accompanied by a SF 1167, detailing a listing of transactions as follows: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Agricultural Services Small Business Development Training Fishery and Artisan Craft Start-Up Costs $15,000 $15,000 $25,000

Scenario GA06: Personal Services Contractors (PSC) employees)

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor will record the payroll transactions for PSCs as described in the scenario below. Background: A Personal Service Contractor (PSC) is an established employer-employee relationship between MCC and contractor employees involving close and continual supervision of contractor employees by Government employees rather than general oversight of contractor operations. MCC hires PSCs to satisfy its consulting needs. The PSCs are contracted through MCC's CGM Division. Federal health, retirement and life insurance benefits for PSCs are not provided. However, Deputy Resident Country Directors (DRCD) who are PSCs may be eligible for reimbursement of life insurance, health insurance, and retirement contributions when proper receipts are submitted. All three benefits are capped at an amount determined by MCC.  13 
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation MCC withholds U.S. Federal or State Income taxes and Social Security or Medicare tax from payroll payments from those PSCs with social security numbers. For those PSCs that do not have withholdings from gross pay, an IRS Form 1099 will be issued to the PSC no later than January 31 of the subsequent year for all gross pay exceeding $600 in the preceding calendar year. PSCs without a social security number (e.g., a foreign national performing work in a MCA country) follow a different process because the MCC payroll system will not have the ability to issue payment without a social security number. Detailed Scenario Information The following persons below are considered PSCs hired by MCC to perform various MCC functions. 1. Jim McNicholas is the Deputy Resident Country Director for the Republic of Georgia. In his PSC agreement with MCC, his status is listed as a full-time Foreign National Deputy Resident Country Director. Mr. McNicholas does not have a Social Security number, therefore, he cannot be paid through the MCC payroll system. 2. Martín Ochoa is the MCA Fiscal Agent for the country of Honduras. In his PSC agreement with MCC, his status is listed as a short-term part-time PSC. Mr. Ochoa has a social security number and therefore can be paid via MCC payroll system. ˇ Scenario GA07 : Advances

Requirement: Demonstrate/Discuss how the Contractor will record advances in its general ledger and subsidiary systems based on the scenarios below. Background: MCC provides advances to Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) countries for the implementation of Compact and 609(g) Agreements. On a monthly basis, MCC disburses Compact and 609(g) agreement funds to a permitted account in an MCA country, and records such amounts as an advance in the MCC's financial system. MCC liquidates the advance amount in the financial system, based on the Quarterly Financial Reports (QFRs) that are prepared by the MCA country. MCC also advances funds to other federal government agencies through IAAs. MCC's Division of Finance records all advance payments as an asset, then liquidates the asset and records an expense upon receiving notice of performance or billings, as required by an IAA. MCC uses the Treasury's IPAC system to process interagency transactions to include advances. The U.S. Government Seller (seller) withdraws funds (advances) from MCC via the IPAC system for costs that will be incurred in the near future when providing goods and services to MCC. MCC's Division of Finance monitors the IPAC transactions and records the advances in the financial system. Advance payments are also liquidated against an obligation in MCC's financial system. Detailed Scenario Information Scenario 1: On June 17, 2008 MCC's Board of Directors approved a $480.9 million Millennium Challenge poverty reduction grant with Burkina Faso. This five-year agreement will help the landlocked West African nation reduce poverty and stimulate economic growth through strategic investments to improve agricultural productivity, land use rights and land management, farm-to-market roads, and girls' primary education. The Accountable Entity and Fiscal Agent for the country of Burkina Faso prepared a QFR and Disbursement Request for $200,000, and provided them to the MCC Transaction Team Leadership by email on August 24,  14 
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation 2008. The Transaction Team Leadership coordinated review and clearance of the QFR and Disbursement Request by the required Transaction Team members and the ACFO. The relevant Transaction Team members and ACFO reviewed the QFR and Disbursement Request to ensure accuracy of: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ The information provided in the schedules The projected amount and funds requested for the next quarter The amount of accrued expenses for the current quarter The cash on hand and interest summary schedule

MCC disburses funds monthly, in accordance with the Disbursement Request, directly to the permitted MCA account established in the country of Burkina Faso and records an advance in its financial system. Scenario 2: MCC has an IAA with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to provide legal clearance services in relating to Compact development with MCC Compact-eligible countries. The IIA with DOJ began on October 1, 2007 and will last until September 30, 2008. On October 1, 2008, MCC processed a $450,000 advance to DOJ through the IPAC system. The DOJ withdrew funds (advances) from MCC via the IPAC system for costs that will it will incur in the following month on MCC's behalf. MCC's Division of Finance recorded the advance in the financial system. ˇ Scenario GA08: Representation Funds

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor will record Entertainment and Representation Funds expenditures in the financial system. Background: MCC's policy is to approve the use of Entertainment and Representation Funds (E&RF) in support of MCC's mission as long as the proposed use of these funds is in accordance with the Millennium Challenge Act and MCC's annual appropriation. MCC may use its E&RF for expenses of a protocol nature, including those that foster relations or promote the accomplishment of MCC's mission with individuals and entities outside of MCC. Examples of events that qualify as allowable entertainment expenses include, but are not limited to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ An event for a visiting senior foreign government official hosted by the CEO An event hosted by the CEO in honor of a visiting foreign official A meeting between an MCC Vice President, Managing Director and a senior visiting foreign official Events associated with a Compact or Threshold program signing An event in honor of host government officials hosted by the CEO at a U.S. embassy An event hosted by MCC's Resident Country Director at his/her residence The cost of printing invitations to events.

Entertainment expenses also may include purchasing gifts of nominal value that are presented to a foreign official by the CEO or designee to commemorate the foreign official's visit to the United States. All E&RF expenditures must be pre-approved, using MCC's Representation or Entertainment Approval and Reimbursement form, at least two days prior to the event or expenditure. All approvals must be made by an authorized delegated MCC Official, including the CEO, Chief of Staff, a Vice President, Managing Director, Resident Country Director, or the senior employee who is the head of an MCC delegation traveling overseas.

 15 
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation MCC pays for each representation and entertainment event only via one of the following three methods: (1) Direct reimbursement to the MCC employee who incurs the expense of the event; (2) Direct payment (to vendor(s)) by the Contracts and Grants Management Division (CGMD); and (3) Payment through MCC funds allotted to the U.S. embassy for the country in which the approved event is held. The pre-approval section of the Representation or Entertainment Approval and Reimbursement form must clearly indicate how the proposed expense(s) will be paid. Detailed Scenario Information MCC plans to sponsor a reception on September 17, 2008, to welcome a visiting delegation from the country of Armenia, to include Mr. Ara Hovsepyan, Mr. Alex Russin, and Mr. Myron Hirniak; all of whom are the Resident Country Officials that oversee the $235.65 million Compact agreement between MCC and the Government of the country of Armenia. This event will be hosted by MCC's CEO, Ambassador John J. Danilovich, and Deputy CEO, Rodney Bent at MCC's headquarters, located at 875 Fifteenth Street NW, Washington, DC 20005-2221. Ambassador Danilovich's Administrative Assistant prepares the necessary Representation or Entertainment Approval and Reimbursement form and obtains the appropriate authorizations prior to the event. The Administrative Assistant uses his/her personal credit card to purchase items for the reception, totaling $1,200.00. After the event, the Administrative Assistant completed Section 2 - Approval of Employer Reimbursement of the Representation or Entertainment Approval and Reimbursement form and resubmitted it to the DCFO management approval and reimbursement. ˇ Scenario GA09: Payroll External File Feeds and Payroll Accruals

Requirement: Using the Detailed Scenario Information below, demonstrate/discuss how the Contractor will accept file feeds from other agencies as described below with data that summarizes financial transactions in support of MCC. In addition, demonstrate how the Contractor will account for MCC payroll accruals in the general ledger and subsidiary systems. Background: MCC processes its payroll transactions through the Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS), operated by the Department of Interior's (DOI) National Business Center NBC). For Personal Service Contractors (PSC), MCC currently relies on the National Finance Center (NFC) to disburse payments to PSCs electronically to PSC bank accounts or via mail. MCC utilizes the Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS) to manage and process MCC's FTE payroll. MCC records payroll data to the NFC web-based payroll System for Time and Attendance Reporting (STAR). It also reconciles monthly disbursements to employee time sheets. MCC currently does not obligate funds for payroll in its general ledgers, but records payroll accruals on a monthly basis at the end of the month. On the first day of the following month, the accrual is reversed. Detailed Scenario Information Below is information related to payroll accrual figures from the period November 25, 2007 through November 30, 2007. The previous payroll period ended November 24, 2007.

Federal income tax deductions, along with MCC and employee FICA and Medicare contributions, to the IRS. Payments are made through the FEDTAX II system. TSP deductions for employee contributions and loan repayments and employer contributions to the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. MCC employees in Permanent Change of Station (PCS) status are eligible for relocation allowances in accordance with State Department guidelines. Some of these allowances, including post differentials, post allowance and danger pay, are based on an employee's salary level and the official duty post location. The payroll system processes these allowances as part of the bi-weekly payroll. MCC funds accrued annual leave balances to ensure appropriated funds are available to meet its costs. As FASAB standards do not preclude funding this liability, it is MCC's policy to obligate funds for this purpose at the end of each quarter.

Millennium Challenge Corporation Jon Anderson has been a Manager in MCC's Department of Compact Implementation's Private Sector Development and Procurement office for three years. On February 5, 2008, he was offered a promotion from GS-14 to GS-15 and a transfer to the country of Mali to serve as MCC's Resident Country Director (RCD). He signed his employment agreement on March 3, 2008, and his first day as Mali's RCD was on May 11, 2008. Mali is a country that already has a permanent post established for the United States through the US State Department. As a transferring employee, Raymond was authorized by his superiors to claim the full relocation entitlement package including the real estate transaction reimbursements. The relocation travel office discussed the entitlements and estimates with Reggie and obligated the authorization on March 10, 2008. MCC would pay for the entire relocation. Raymond rents a small home in Alexandria, VA. He estimated that it would cost $5,000 to early terminate his lease. The costs for a house-hunting trip, shipping his household goods, en route travel to Mali and miscellaneous costs of $80,000 are also estimated as part of the original obligation. MCC's annual FY 2008 allotment to the State Departments US Embassy in Mali was determined to be $200,000. ˇ Scenario GA11: Standard Accounting Classification Structure

The process to request a DUNS Number via phone takes about 10 minutes and is free of charge. Internet requests are fulfilled within 24 hours. Once a DUNS Number has been issued, it will be available for use in CCR within 24 hours. ˇ Scenario GA13: Travel

Requirement: Demonstrate how OFF records travel expenditures that over-lap fiscal years. Background: MCC's travel policies and procedures apply to employees traveling within the continental United States (CONUS), internationally, and individuals based at a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) traveling locally or internationally. MCC has an on-site travel management contractor (TMC) to serve as MCC's travel agent under the direct supervision of the Office of the Managing Director of Administrative Services in MCC's Department of Finance and Administration. The TMC provides airline, hotel, and other travel reservation support services for all MCC travelers. MCC's travel management system, E-Travel, is not integrated with the financial system and is unable to provide routine and controlled processing updates of how E-Travel data (authorizations, amendments, and vouchers) financially impacts the general ledger. The Division of Finance is responsible for ensuring that MCC staff manually enter data and update MCC's financial transactions and balances within five (5) days of receiving an approved voucher. MCC requires an employee to complete an individual MCC Travel Approval Form (TAF), and then complete a travel authorization (TA) in the E-Travel system. The TMC issues tickets in accordance with the terms of the TA (only after the obligation has been recorded). On a monthly basis, the TMC's head office submits an invoice to MCC and the Travel Office. MCC travelers must include estimated travel expenses on both the TAF and the TA. Estimated amounts include costs for airline tickets, lodging, meals and incidental expenses (M&IE), car rental, taxis, telephone calls, internet access, and other miscellaneous expenses. MCC's Travel Coordinator reviews the estimated costs in the E-Travel system to determine compliance with federal regulations and MCC's Travel Policies and Procedures. MCC travelers enter the appropriate accounting code in the E-Travel TA prior to submission for approval. The Travel Coordinator is responsible for providing a list of proper accounting codes that include the funding year, fund, program, department and country accounting code to the Division of Finance. If a traveler is traveling to more than one country, he or she is required to split funds accordingly. A traveler must file a travel voucher claiming legitimate and authorized expenses within five (5) business days of completing a trip, or within 30 calendar days during an extended trip. All MCC travelers use the E-Travel system for processing and reimbursement of travel vouchers. The Travel Coordinator approves the voucher within five (5) business days of the traveler submitting an accurately completed voucher the Travel Coordinator approves the voucher. The approval signifies that the claimed items are authorized and approved for payment to the traveler. A travel voucher for which reimbursement exceeds the cost estimate in the travel authorization by more than $100 will not be approved by the Travel Coordinator. The traveler is required to either (1) complete an amendment in E-Travel; or (2) provide a memo from their Managing Director with an explanation and approval of the additional expenses.  21

Millennium Challenge Corporation Detailed Scenario Information On September 15, 2007, the Deputy Vice President of Europe, Asia, & Latin America, Frances Reid, received authorization to travel to Nicaragua for a series of meeting with MCC's RCD of Nicaragua and staff regarding it Compact Program. The trip dates are from September 25, 2007 through September 30, 2007. Ms. Reid submitted the proper TAF and TA form in the E-Travel system along with estimated of total travel costs of $5,000. Upon arriving in Managua, Ms. Reid incurred additional transportation expenses of $125.00 (paid in local currency of Córdoba), for various business-related travel in the country. Upon further review of Compact program activities in and around Managua, it was determined (an approved) that Ms. Reid needed to extend her trip in Nicaragua an additional 5 days, in order to meet with vendors responsible for expanding the Pan American highway. This $12 million transportation project will rehabilitate 18 kilometers of road to connect thousands of farmers to markets across Central America. The 5 additional days of travel expenditures totaled $2,500. Ms. Reid return to Washington, DC on October 5, 2007 and submitted the proper travel voucher information into the E-travel system for processing and payment. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE (AP) SCENARIOS ˇ Scenario AP01: Receipt of Goods and Services

Requirement: Demonstrate how OFF handles the receipt of goods and services (where the amount billed is the greater than the amount obligated) related to current as well as expired funds. Background: MCC COTRs coordinate with the Division of Contracts and Grants Management, Division of Finance to properly account for invoice payments and interagency transfers. The processes include: Administrative Approval of Invoices To approve invoices, MCC COTRs examine and approve processed invoices received from NBC and return approved invoices to NBC. NBC schedules payments, enters approved invoices into the core financial system, certifies vouchers for payment, and releases invoices to Treasury to disburse payment. Inter-Agency Payables Interagency fund transfers are processed using the Intergovernmental Payment and Collection (IPAC) system. MCC fund transfers, to and from agencies, are recorded as payments and collections, respectively. The MCC RCD coordinates with the International Cooperative Administrative Support Services (ICASS) Service Center and the MCC OOA to create preliminary ICASS invoices for submittal to the ACFO and the recording of the amount as an obligation in MCC's financial system. Upon receipt of the final invoice and actual costs, MCC disburses the funds via IPAC. Capital Security Cost Sharing (CSCS) Program Procedures When applicable, the OOA coordinates with the appropriate Embassy and Overseas Building Operations to obtain an accurate estimate of Embassy expenses. The OOA provides the estimate to MCC for the recording of an obligation, which is then liquidated on receipt of the invoice after ACFO verification of funds availability.

Millennium Challenge Corporation Some recipient countries receive moneys through the International Treasury System (ITS). The ITS transfers moneys to the recipient countries' permitted accounts (MCAs) when requested by the recipient countries' MCC representatives. MCC's accounting personnel will rely on vendor invoices, batched from the recipient countries, for verification. Prompt Payment Act requirements will be shorter for the OFF and its accounting personnel when paying through the ITS. The initial time period required for payment will start within the recipient country and end when the accountable entities have disbursed the payments to the vendors and other recipients. Detailed Scenario Information An invoice for $1,300 for computer services provided by EDS purchased under a contract is received by the MCC Accountant. The MCC Accountant verifies that services were received and submits a signed invoice with management approval to pay it to EDS. After reviewing the invoice for completeness, the MCC Accountant checks in the financial system to verify sufficient funds exist for the obligation. In this case, the obligation is only for $1,000. Since insufficient funds exist for paying the invoice, The MCC Accountant notifies the MCC Budget office of insufficient obligations to pay the invoice. Depending on the cause of insufficient obligation, the Budget official will make a determination to either obligate additional funds or reject the invoice due to overage of the contract amount. In this scenario, the vendor invoiced for an amount greater than the contract's remaining funds. The Budget official will reject the invoice and return it to the vendor for correction. ˇ Scenario AP02: Late Payment

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor will record the receipt of services where the bill is paid more than 125 days from the date the invoice was received by MCC. Assume that the receiving report was promptly processed into the accounting system, before the government received the invoice. Also, assume the vendor is paid through the ITS, where the initial time period required for payment will start within the recipient country (Lesotho) and end when MCC has disbursed the payments to the vendors (John Deere). Assume that interest accrues beginning on the first calendar day after submission of a proper invoice, and ending on the date on which payment, including late fees, is made by MCC. Late payment fees are calculated by using the prevailing Prompt Payment Act interest rate. Detailed Scenario Information A $100,000 contract for a Backhoe is awarded on July 21, 2007 by MCC Procurement office supporting the Lesotho Compact program. The contract (# MCC-CO-05-937471) (FOB Destination) was awarded to a John Deere Tractor and Farm Supplies dealership located in Maseru, the capital city of Lesotho. The Lesotho RCD acting as the property officer received the Backhoe on September 1, 2007, and the receiving report was processed and sent to MCC Finance office for processing in the accounting system on September 2, 2007. The invoice in the amount of $100,000 was received and date-stamped on September 12, 2007 by MCC accounting. The unprocessed invoice was placed on the desk of an employee on family leave. When the employee returns and prepares the invoice for payment on January 16, 2008, the system calculates interest due of $ 1,632.97 for 124 (18 days for Sept. 2007+90 days for Oct. 2007 ­ Dec. 2007 + 16 days for Jan. 2008) in accordance with the Prompt Pay Act. The employee then forwards the invoice to the DCFO officer, who is on TDY until February 3, 2008. The invoice is certified and paid on February 6, 2008. On February 21, 2008, the Lesotho RCD  23 
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation receives a letter from John Deere Company requesting payment of the additional interest, due through February 6, 20068 in the amount of $277.08 (21 days from January 17, 2008 ­ February 6, 2008 * .00475 daily interest rate), along with a late penalty of $85.00, pursuant to the Prompt Pay Act Rules. ˇ Scenario AP03: Consolidation of Purchase Requests

Requirement: Demonstrate the ability of OFF to consolidate Purchase Request and Commitment (PR&C) documents for services for customers from different funds. Demonstrate the transaction from the original purchase order through payment of the invoice. Detailed Scenario Information On March 11, 2008, the Director and Associate Director of MCC's Security Department, both requested new laptops to replace their existing desktops. In accordance with MCC policy, after the request is approved by a Senior Official in the Division of Administration and Finance, the request for laptops is sent to MCC's Procurement department, where it is reviewed and approved. On March 13, 2008, the Managing Director of Human Resources requests two laptops for new hires (a program assistant and a human resources specialist). In accordance with MCC policy, after the request is approved by a Senior Official in the Division of Administration and Finance, the request for laptops is sent to MCC's Procurement department, where it is reviewed and approved. On March 14, 2008, a Managing Director in the Compact Development department determines that there is a need to upgrade four old laptops being used by program development analysts in that office. A request for four new laptops is forwarded to the MCC's Procurement department, in accordance with MCC policy. The Senior Procurement specialist in charge of IT procurement for MCC determined the three aforementioned orders can be combined to reduce administrative costs and to allow for better negotiation. The company providing the computers, Dell, is on the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule and provides a 2% discount for payment within 10 days of receipt of the invoice. A local purchase transaction (purchase order # OCGM-HQS-06-311321) for eight computers totals $12,000 ($1,500 each computer). With the prompt payment discount, this amount comes to $11,760 ($240 discount). The laptops are ordered March 1, 2008 and received on March 14, 2008. The receiving report is processed in the accounting system on the same day. The invoice accompanies the laptops to MCC Payment is made on March 22, 2008 at the discount price. ˇ Scenario AP04: Lease Agreement

Requirement: Using the information on the two leases below, demonstrate how the Contractor will record payment for the first six months on a new operating lease where the Lease is signed in July 2008 but the right to occupy the premises according to the lease begins on October 1, 2008. Demonstrate how the Contractor will allow for the automation of recurring lease payments, except for first and last months (with prior review and approval by a payment certifying official). Background: MCC may make payments for recurring services, which are performed under agency-vendor agreements for payments of definite amounts at fixed periodic intervals, without the submission of a vendor invoice (for example, rent payment). The Contract and Grants Managing Director (CGMD) prepares contracts for recurring services. Payments for recurring service are made in accordance with Prompt Payment Act regulations.  24 
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation MCC also provides allotments to pertinent Embassies to incur expenses on MCC's behalf. These allotments cover a variety of expenses to include leases. MCC Accounting sets up the recurring payments, to include amount and frequency of payments in its core financial system. When the payment is due, the MCC certifying officer approves the disbursement. MCC establishes administrative controls for ensuring recurrent payments are: against unexpired contracts or agreements; for correct amounts; for services actually performed, and are not duplications.

Detailed Scenario Information MCC has the following lease agreements. Lease 1: Bowen Building LP, c/o Kaempher Management Services ­ 10 year lease, Monthly payment $450,000. Lease 2: TREA 1401 H, LLC ­ 8 year lease ­ Monthly payment - $18,850. ˇ Scenario AP05: Leasehold Improvements

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor will account for leasehold improvements at multiple locations and phases. Background: MCC's Department of Administration and Finance oversees all PP&E management activities for MCC and ensures that such activities comply with applicable laws and regulations. MCC defines leasehold improvements as cost at or above $50,000, and a useful life of 5 years or more. MCC treats build-out costs as a leasehold improvement depreciable asset. Included in these costs are: ˇ Architectural and interior design ˇ Construction costs to create suitable offices and working space; ˇ Purchases of systems furniture; ˇ Purchases of desk chairs and other miscellaneous office items. MCC records all costs associated with build-out (leasehold improvements) in its financial system as one depreciable asset. Detailed Scenario Information MCC has approximately $9,265,724.01 in leasehold improvements capitalized in its asset management system. A description of the leasehold improvements is as follows:

Scenario AP06: Vendor Indebtedness

Requirement: Demonstrate how the Contractor will record the payment of an invoice for goods and/or services where the vendor is indebted to the United States for an amount that exceeds the payment due to the vendor for the goods or services received by MCC. Discuss solution(s) for displaying Treasury offset (both check and EFT) against vendor payments using a Treasury offset entry table. Note: All modern Accounting Systems that are FSIO Compliant require an obligation to be present before any payment can be made. Detailed Scenario Information In order to retain and utilize data from the Compact Eligible Country survey that was conducted during FY 2007, a $45,677 contract to assemble the survey is awarded to HGS Data Management. HGS was awarded the contract (contract # MCC-HGS-05-009982) on October 6, 2007 by the MCC OCG. HGS Data Management completed its work assembling the Compact Eligible Country survey on December 8, 2007. MCC's OCG submitted a receiving report electronically to MCC Accounting department on December 8, 2007. HGS Data Management submitted a $45,677 invoice (invoice # 311447) to MCC that was received and processed by MCC accounts payable group on December 14, 2007. At the time the HGS Data Management  26 
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation invoice (invoice # 311447) is processed, MCC's records indicate that HGS Data Management is indebted to the United States Government (for other federal agencies indebtedness issues unrelated to the MCC contract) in the amount of $58,334. MCC Accounting applied the entire debt to the invoice, leaving a remaining balance of $12,657 that is owed to the Federal Government by HGS. ˇ Scenario AP07: Payment to Foreign Vendor

Requirement: Demonstrate how the OFF system will record a payment to a Foreign Vendor (in the vendor's local currency) for goods and services delivered to the RCD for an activity in Mali. Background: MCC utilizes a Common Payment System (CPS) to disburse Compact, Compact Implementation, and 609(g) Funds directly to vendors from the U.S. Treasury. CPS refers to the system(s) used by MCC to process payments in U.S. dollars or foreign currency directly to vendors to pay for goods and services received. There are currently two systems that comprise CPS. The International Treasury Services (ITS) system is used for disbursement of funds to non-US banks. ITS is the U.S. Treasury's web-based interface that enables Federal agencies to issue foreign currency payments via direct deposit, wire transfer, or draft (in limited instances and varies by country) to non-US banks in over 150 countries. Additionally, ITS enables agencies to issue international US dollar wire transfer payments without a corresponding US financial institution. There are no fees associated with the use of ITS, and foreign currency exchange losses are absorbed by Treasury. The Secure Payment System (SPS) is a dual purpose system: 1) it is used to disburse funds to banks located within the United States and 2) it supports the ITS payment process by serving as a way to certify payments created in the ITS. The CPS payment process is initiated by the submission and receipt of vendor invoices. All MCA invoices are approved in accordance with applicable MCC policies and procedures outlined in the Fiscal Accountability Plan (FAP). Once an invoice has been approved, the MCA Fiscal Agent (or designee) will prepare MCA Payment Request Form(s) for submission to MCC for payment. Two types of payments are processed through CPS: 1) Non-US bank payments (using ITS as the payment mechanism); and 2) US bank payments (using SPS as the payment mechanism).

Millennium Challenge Corporation organization's needs and activities. MCC defines Expensed and Inventoried Assets, and Capital Assets as follows. Expensed and Inventoried Assets MCC's established threshold for expensed PP&E that shall be inventoried and tracked generally: ˇ Have an estimated useful life of two (2) or more years ˇ Have a replacement value of at least $150 ˇ Are not intended for sale in the ordinary course of business ˇ Are intended to be used, or available for use, by MCC Capital Assets MCC capitalizes the following PP&E assets: ˇ Software with a unit cost at or above $200,000 and a useful life of 5 years or more. ˇ Information technology (IT) infrastructure with a unit cost at or above $200,000 and a useful life of 3 years or more ˇ Other general PP&E (office furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements) with a unit cost at or above $50,000, and a useful life of 5 years or more. MCC's Senior Accountant utilizes a manual spreadsheet system to accurately account for the value of capital assets. MCC's IT Assets Management Officer records the procurement of IT assets, and controls IT assets through an offline spreadsheet and through the physical control of IT assets. Although the MCC is responsible for the accurately accounting for assets purchased for use abroad, the process is managed in the Compact country by Department of State (State) employees, systems, and processes. The State Department reports on the status of these assets through the Non-expendable Asset Management System (NEPA). MCC's OOA relies on NEPA reports to properly account for overseas assets. For the procurement and management of IT assets used overseas, the RCD and Deputy RCD coordinate with the MCC IT Asset Management Officer. Detailed Scenario Information On October 15, 2007, MCC purchased a set of 50 Alcatel Digital Phones for use at it two locations in Washington, DC. Each phone has a unit price of $300.00, and has a useful life of 4 years. Upon receipt of purchase, each phone was bar- coded with a MCC asset tag number and recorded in MCC's asset management system as inventoried assets. On January 12, 2008, MCC's IT department purchased a back-up server for its disaster recovery site in Martinsburg, WV. The back-up server had an acquisition cost of $800,000 and an estimated useful life of 5 years. After final inspection and set-up, the back-up server was placed into service on January 22, 2008. On July 13, 2008, the MCC Senior Accountant reviewed the Asset Acquisition Report from the NEPA system as of June 30, 2008, noting that 15 laptop computers were purchased for use by MCC employees in the MCA Compact Country of El Salvador. The laptops were acquired on May 18, 2008, with a unit price of $1,500 and a useful life of 3 years. ˇ Scenario PP02: Equipment Salvage/Disposal

Requirement: Demonstrate/Discuss how the Contractor will account for the disposal of MCC assets that have a residual/salvage value recorded in its asset management system and MCC financial system.  29 
MCC-09-RFQ-0008 Financial Management Business Consulting Services (FMBCS)

Millennium Challenge Corporation Background: No property can be removed from the approved Property Management Inventory System without the proper approvals and documentation. For Equipment Disposal, MCC uses the Report of Excess Personal Property Form (SF-120). The SF-120 is primary form used to report personal property that is no longer needed and/or useable for its intended purpose. GSA requires that non-expendable Government property that MCC plans to dispose of, regardless of cost, condition, be reported on a SF-120 for disposition. The AAMO will forward the SF120 documentation, report, and a photograph (if available) of the property to GSA. The Administrative Asset Management Officer (AAMO) AAMO will initially consider Abandonment or Destruction of PP&E after reporting the property to GSA when the property is determined to be scrap and/or salvage. In addition, the property must meet one or more of the following conditions: ˇ The value of the property is so little, or the cost of continued care and handling is so high, that its retention for resale, even as scrap, is clearly not economical. ˇ Abandonment or destruction is necessary for health, safety, or security reasons. ˇ The item had an initial acquisition cost of less than $500.00, and the expense and difficulty of retaining it for sale would clearly not warrant retention. The AAMO will carry out abandonment or destruction of Federal property only after GSA has determined the property to be of no value. GSA also gives authorization if property has been sold and the buyer has failed to remove it from MCC as stipulated Detailed Scenario Information The following MCC equipment has been identified as "excess personal property" and will need to be reported to GSA for appropriate action. 1. Five laptop computers with a combined salvage value of $100.00 as recorded in MCC's Property Management Inventory System. 2. One executive office desk with a salvage value of $150.00 as recorded in MCC's Property Management Inventory System.

Requirement: Demonstrate how the proposed OFF system will systematically generate the Status of Funds Reports (SF- 133) as required by OMB and the U.S. Department of Treasury. Background: MCC is required to report its status of budgetary resources at the end of each fiscal quarter to the Department of Treasury via SF-133 (Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources, Standard Form 133(SF-133)) in Treasury's Federal Agencies' Centralized Trial-balance System II (FACTS II). The SF-133 is the standard form used by federal agencies to report to OMB on the status of obligations, expenditures and unliquidated obligations. The SF-133 report shows the extent to which MCC's budget resources are available for obligation, whether obligated amounts have changed since the last reporting, and the status of outlays on obligations. MCC's Senior Budget Officer, DCFO and Assistant CFO review and approve the SF-133 before sending it to Treasury. Detailed Scenario Information Using the Reports Generator Application provided by the OFF system and the combined details for all relevant scenarios demonstrate the production of a Status of Funds (SF -133) reports, based on closing balances at September 30, 2008 as required by OMB and the MCC Act.

Rating Guidelines Quality of Product or Service 0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding

Unsatisfactory Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards containing similar requirements. Poor Fair Good Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements. Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements. There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements. There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate additional costs to the Government. The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".
