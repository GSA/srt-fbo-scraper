ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 PROPOSAL EVALUATION AND CONTRACT AWARD

1. ELIGIBILITY FOR CONTRACT AWARD In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), no contract shall be entered into unless the Contracting Officer ensures that all requirements of law, executive orders, regulations, and all other applicable procedures, including clearances and approvals, have been met. This includes the FAR requirement that no award shall be made unless the contracting officer makes an affirmative determination of responsibility. To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must meet the general standards in FAR Part 9 and any special standards set forth in the solicitation. 2. BEST VALUE SOURCE SELECTION The Government will evaluate each proposal against the evaluation factors established under the Evaluation Factors for Award. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, should no proposal be determined technically acceptable, the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range consisting of the most highly rated proposals. Once the competitive range is established, the Government will engage in discussions with all offerors included in the competitive range. After receipt of the Offeror's responses raised during discussions, responses will be rated again in the same manner as for the initial evaluation. 3. BASIS OF AWARD Subject to the provisions contained herein, award will be made to one (1) Offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation; who conforms to the solicitation requirements; and whose proposal, judged by an overall assessment of the evaluation criteria and other considerations specified in this solicitation, represents the best value for the Government. The Government intends to select the responsible Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation and is determined to be the Best Value to the Government in accordance with the following relationship between price and technical merit: The non-cost related Technical Factors of Technical Approach/Management Plan, Experience, Past Performance, Commercial Rate Structure and Subcontracting Plan are listed in descending order of importance. Technical Approach/ Management Plan is approximately twice as important as Experience and Past Performance, combined. Commercial Rate Structure and Subcontracting Plan are the least important. When combined, the five (5) Technical Factors of Technical Approach/Management Plan, Experience, Past Performance, Commercial Rate Structure and Subcontracting Plan are approximately equal to Price. 4. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD Evaluation of the Technical Proposal The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's experience, past performance, methods and approach in meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence to ensure successful performance. FACTOR 1 ­ TECHNICAL APPROACH/MANAGEMENT PLAN The Government will evaluate the offeror's technical approach/management plan provided in response to the solicitation in accordance with the following:

FACTOR 3 ­ PAST PERFORMANCE Past performance information will be evaluated, including work history and demonstrated quality performance as shown by past government and commercial entities' evaluations of offeror's performance within the last five years in work areas related to the RFP. The following items shall be considered in evaluating past performance: Currency and Relevancy of the Information; Source of the Information; Context of the Past Performance Information; and General Trends in Performance. The Government will contact the three current and/or previous clients provided by the Offeror. The Government may also seek past performance information through the use of data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. All contacts will be asked to briefly state the nature of their involvement with the Offeror and will then be asked the questions contained in the Past Performance Questionnaire. The Offeror must demonstrate recent, relevant, acceptable past performance for the three projects submitted under Factor 2, Experience, and from any other sources the Government may contact. Performance under a project will be determined "acceptable" if the Offeror has obtained or demonstrated a performance evaluation rating of at least "satisfactory", or equivalent, on the project, and will be determined recent and relevant if the project meets the minimum requirements as outlined under Factor 2, Experience. There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation. The first is to evaluate the offeror's past performance to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the offeror is to the effort to be acquired through the source selection. A performance confidence assessment rating will be assigned for each Offeror after evaluating the Offeror's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements. With respect to relevancy, more relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance confidence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance. The ratings and definitions for FACTOR 3 ­ RELEVANCY OF PAST PERFORMANCE are listed and defined below:

Rating Very Relevant Relevant Somewhat Relevant Not Relevant

Definition Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

The second aspect of the past performance evaluation will be to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts. The Government will evaluate the past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance confidence assessment.

The ratings and definitions for FACTOR 3 ­ PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT OF PAST PERFORMANCE are listed and defined below: Rating Substantial Confidence Description Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

FACTOR 6 ­ PRICE An evaluation will be performed on the proposed Price. The evaluation will not be assigned an adjectival or color rating but will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness as follows: Completeness - To be complete, the Offeror must provide all data that is requested and necessary to conduct an evaluation. Reasonableness ­ The Offeror's proposal is evaluated through price analysis techniques as described in FAR Part 15. For Price to be reasonable, it must represent a Price that provides best value to the

Government when consideration is given to Prices in the market, (market conditions may be evidenced by other competitive proposals), technical and functional capabilities of the Offeror.
