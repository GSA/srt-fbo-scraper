   full and open competition.”

Nature and/or description of the action being approved.Specify the DEA office, location, COTR, and telephone number.


   This Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition approves the use of brand name specifications to describe the Government’s
   requirement.
   This requirement was established by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Office of Information Systems (SI), Operations & Support
   Section, Francois Abi-Najm, 202-307-7394.
3. 2. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including estimated value).

      List the brand name description of the supplies/equipment to be acquired. Include the part and other appropriate nomenclature by which the
   product is offered for sale.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a requirement for 4,44920 Hewlett Packard model DC7900 Small Form Factor computers to be used as
   workstations on DEA’s Firebird System Network for a 48-month period.  The specification of these computers (Attachment 1) conforms to
   Configuration #31 of the Firebird Technical Reference Manual.  Based on its analysis, DEA has determined that it is in its best interests to
   lease the computers for the intended usage period.  The expected rollout of the units will be 41370 units per month for 12 months beginning
   September 3029, 200910.  The specified brand name and specification are intrinsic to the Government’s requirement and are the only products
   that the Government will consider acceptable for meeting its requirement.  The required items are listed below:

   This requirement has an estimated value of [ REDACTED ].


34.   An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.


   The statutory authority for this Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) – “Only one responsible source
   and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”
   List the salient characteristics (those characteristics that are unique to the item being procured, that an "or equal" brand cannot satisfy).
   The specified brand names and models are the only items that will satisfy the Government’s requirement because these items are approved
   components of the enterprise architecture of DEA’s Firebird System, as specified in the DEA Firebird Technical Reference Model.  No other
   products of similar function have been approved by the DEA Infrastructure Configuration Control Board for this purpose.
45.   A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.


   The nature of the acquisition requires the use of the cited authority for the following reasons:


      a) DEA’s requirement entails brand name specifications, which by its very nature limits competition.


      b) The products comprising the Government’s requirement are to be integrated within the DEA Firebird System, which is the principle
         sensitive but unclassified (SBU) network providing office automation applications and other resources to DEA offices worldwide.  DEA has
         established the Infrastructure Configuration Change Control Board (ICCCB) to make determinations of standards for its Firebird and other
         systems, and approve necessary changes as might be warranted in its view.  All ICCCB-approved standards for the Firebird System are
         listed in the Firebird Technical Reference Model (FTRM).

      c) These products are specified in the current FTRM as the standard configuration for Firebird workstations (Configuration #31).  There are
         no other products listed in the FTRM that are suitable for the same purposes met by the products specified in the requirement as
         described herein.  Use of any other products would result in non-compliance with the configuration standards set by the ICCCB.

      d) The Government expects to achieve significant cost savings by standardizing its workstation platforms, which will encourage volume
         pricing discounts from vendors and facilitate avoidance of unnecessary and duplicative costs associated with maintaining and managing
         multiple workstation platforms.

   Based on the foregoing facts, it is not practicable or reasonable to consider any other products.  FAR 6.302-1(c) directs agencies to cite the
   referenced statutory citation (see item 4) when justifying the use of brand name specifications.


6.    A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a
   notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.

      Describe any market survey conducted to identify all qualified sources of the brand name as well as methods used to determine that only the
brand name product would meet the government’s minimum needs.
   No market survey was done for the purpose of identifying alternative products that might meet the Government’s need because intrinsic to the
   Government’s requirement is the approval of such products by theThis requirement will be solicited through the government-wide point of entry
   (FedBizOpps) using the combined synopsis/solicitation technique authorized by FAR 12.603 DEA Infrastructure Configuration Control Board, which
   a market survey would not satisfy.  All interested and eligible parties will be invited to participate.


57.   A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.


   The Government’s cost estimate was based on a survey of current market prices.  The actual costs of the requirement will be determined on the
   basis of adequate price competition.  The prices resulting from this process are anticipated to be fair and reasonable. Describe why the brand
   name product satisfies the criteria stated above and why an “or equal” brand cannot.

  8. A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.

   DEA conducted market research by reviewing leading technology solutions over the Internet, reviewing technical journals and industry reports,
   periodically meeting with vendors, and attending technical expositions where other vendor solutions were presented.  Based on the results of
   the market research and other information and in accordance with agency procedures, the ICCCB established the HP Small Form Factor computer as
   the standard workstation for the DEA Firebird System Network.

  9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

   DEA has established a policy that all hardware and software that is to be integrated into the Firebird System Network must be approved by the
   ICCCB and specified in the FTRM.

 10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

   There were no sources that have expressed interest in this requirement.

 11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition
     for the supplies or services required.

   The establishment of standards for DEA’s information technology (IT) systems is set forth in agency policy, which implements federal IT laws,
   regulations, and directives.  It is unlikely and unreasonable to expect that DEA will forego specifying infrastructure standards using
   specific make and model descriptions.  Therefore, there are no actions that may be taken to remove the barriers to full and open competition
   prior to subsequent acquisition of the requirement described herein.

 12.

The products specified in the Government’s requirement have been approved by the DEA Infrastructure Configuration Control Board for inclusion in
the enterprise architecture framework, as specified in the DEA Firebird Technical Reference Model.
6.    Technical/Requirement Certification.
"I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my
knowledge and belief."
