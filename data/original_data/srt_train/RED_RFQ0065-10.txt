As of November 21,2009, the new GINA law has gone into affect. With this new law has come a new poster. We are excited to see the new poster available for download on our website as well as the poster supplement. BrightKey has received over 6,000 orders for this new poster and we are working diligently to have orders mailed out as quickly as possible. We have referred a great amount of customers to the website to download these posters as well as the poster supplement. With EEOC changing the poster order limit from 10 posters to 5 posters, as well as NOT shipping any orders overseas, we expect to see a decrease in our order volume and EEOC should expect a decrease in postage as well. We hope to have this new poster limit added to the website, for it still gives you an option of ordering up to 10 copies.

                                           for the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
                                                 Office of Communications and Legislative Affairs



1.0   INTRODUCTION

      The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is acquiring publication distribution and warehousing services in support of EEOC’s
      mission to “Promote Equality of Opportunity in the Workplace and Enforce Federal Laws Prohibiting Employment Discrimination”.

2.0   BACKGROUND

      EEOC has a statutory mandate under 42 USC 2000e-4 to educate the public and provide outreach and technical assistance to facilitate
      voluntary compliance with the laws that the Commission enforces.  EEOC distributes information to the public, including employers and
      employees, about their rights and responsibilities under the law.  The Office of Communications and Legislative Affairs is responsible for
      EEOC publication request processing, distribution, document storage and inventory.  Under EEOC’s Limited English Proficient (LEP) Plan, in
      response to an August 2000 Federal Executive Order, EEOC publications are made available to the public in various languages upon request by
      telephone, text telephone, and e-mail.  Inventory of the publications is stored at the contractor’s facility to expedite delivery of the
      documents to the public.  EEOC-accessible real-time electronic inventory data helps prevent shortfalls, backlogged requests and delayed
      deliveries.  For many years EEOC has used a contractor to process publication requests and provide storage and inventory management
      services [Reference Appendix A, Publications and Distribution Statistical Data].  EEOC plans to continue that approach under a new
      contract.

3.0   SCOPE OF WORK

      The scope of this PWS is to provide the EEOC with a full-service publication distribution center that will establish toll-free telephone
      service to aid in the processing and tracking of publication orders, create and execute a transition plan to transfer existing inventory
      from the incumbent facility to the contractor’s facility, store and monitor EEOC publication inventory and maintain all associated
      facilities and equipment required for performance, develop a contingency plan for an alternate facility, maintain a database of requests,
      and provide functional and technical support and training on EEOC publications for telecommunications staff receiving orders.  Government
      furnished property such as CD-ROMs and diskettes previously used for this requirement will be provided to the contractor.


      A minimum of 8,900 cubic feet of space will be required to meet EEOC’s current document storage needs.  The contractor must have the
      ability to expand storage capacity by 20% in the event that EEOC’s documents storage needs increase.  The contractor’s facility should be
      located within fifty (50) miles of the EEOC’s headquarters at 131 M Street, NE, in Washington, DC.

4.0   APPLICABLE DIRECTIVES

      Appendix A contains Publications and Distribution Statistical Data (FY 2009 & 10)
      Appendix B – 1 Weekly Top 10 Publications Reports (From March 2010)
      Appendix B – 2 Monthly Progress Reports (From January and February 2010)
      Appendix C contains a list of definitions, acronyms and/or abbreviations in common use within the EEOC community
      Appendix D is a list of EEOC Inventory Reports by Product ID (March 2010)
