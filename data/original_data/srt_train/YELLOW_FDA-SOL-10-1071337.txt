Title: Unified FDA Technical Support for Operation and Maintenance of Empirica Signal Detection SoftwareŠ2000-2008 Phase Forward Incorporated (1) BACKGROUND The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of all FDA regulated products such as human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, food and dietary supplements, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. The Statutory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), Section 406), Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of regulated marketed products. To accomplish its public health mission and its strategic goals and objectives, FDA needs to ensure pre-market and post-market safety and efficacy of regulated products. While many common and preventable risks are identified and evaluated before a product is marketed, some risks become evident only after a product is marketed and real-world experience with the product is documented. Undesirable occurrences can not always be predicted by studies and biostatistical analysis during pre-market reviews. Post-market safety surveillance is performed on all FDA regulated products in order to identify undesirable occurrences, including adverse events and product problems associated with the use of a regulated product in humans and animals. FDA has collected adverse event and product problem reports for over thirty years. These reports are stored electronically and accessed through several adverse event systems within FDA. The number of adverse event and product problem reports received each year has steadily increased and is expected to continue to increase due to new FDA reporting regulations, increased public awareness, and media coverage of the FDA's post-market surveillance program. FDA's current adverse event reporting systems include CDER and CBER's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS), CBER's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, CDRH's system, Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database - (MAUDE), CFSAN's Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS), CVM's PV Works and FDA's EON Safety Database. Collectively, these systems hold well over five million reports of product safety. FDA uses various tools to evaluate these reports, including the data repositories, the data warehouses, and Empirica Signal. Empirica Signal is a tool that performs a variety of sophisticated statistical analyses on FDA's adverse event and product problem data. The data used by Empirica Signal is extracted from one of the FDA adverse event data repositories into a data warehouse. In this data warehouse, data management services are performed such as standardizing product names against a product dictionary and using algorithms to eliminate duplicate reports. This modified data set is then extracted from the data warehouse for use by Empirica Signal.

Empirica Signal provides a reproducible and systematic approach to see important and useful safety signals. Empirica Signal provides an effective tool for the early detection of previously unknown adverse reactions to both newly approved and established regulated products. Empirica Signal provides multiple graphical illustrations of the data that can serve as valuable input to the overall process of product safety monitoring and review. Safety signals identified by Empirica Signal are individual product-event combinations that occur in a higher than expected proportion. These signals need to be carefully investigated to understand if regulatory action needs to be taken. These actions might include requesting additional information, reviewing other drug in the class for similar safety signals and reviewing the individual cases to identify confounding factors such as concomitant medications and comorbid medical conditions. The results of the investigation may result in regulatory actons such as modification of the product label, programs to mitigate risk for the product, or in extreme cases removal of the product from the market.

The Empirica Signal software was originally developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between the FDA and a company called Lincoln Technologies. The terms of the CRADA include a perpetual software license for FDA. Therefore, FDA is not seeking licenses for software use, it is seeking technical support for data management, software configuration, software implementation and training. FDA requires support services for maintenance and operations of Empirica Signal. Currently, multiple Centers have individual contracts in place for supporting several instances of Empirica Signal for CDER/CBER, CDRH, and CFSAN. These contracts support current efforts in data management, system training, and application maintenance. This contract shall provide the opportunity and means to for all FDA Centers and Offices to procure services for maintenance and operations of Empirica Signal. For CDER/CBER FDA is presently using two servers; one

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 ATTACHMENT 1: IDIQ CONTRACT STATEMENT OF WORK

Page 3 of 9

for production and one for development. Multiple instances of the Empirica Signal software may exist on a single server. For CDRH one server is used, and for CFSAN two servers are used. One Windows server is hosting the application and one Unix server is hosting the database. At the discretion of FDA OIM, additional or replacement servers or server configurations may be provided. In addition to using the Empirica Signal software as it is publically released, FDA routinely identifies unique FDA needs such as accessing data elements from FDA's adverse event reports that may not be publically available and hence are not surfaced in the general software release but are available to FDA and useful for FDA analysis. Efforts such as this may require FDA specific system configuration and would be coordinated through the Empirica Signal Change Control Board. (2) OBJECTIVES The objectives of this contract are to obtain the qualified services for continued services for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of FDA's current instances of Empirica Signal and associated data management activities which supports FDA's mission to protect the public by continued surveillance of FDA regulated product safety reports. (3) SCOPE OF WORK Operations, Maintenance, and User Support for Empirica Signal software application and related COTS software.

Task Order #1 Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Technical Support Task Order

1.

BACKGROUND

The goal of data mining of AERS data at CDER and CBER is to utilize the adverse event (AE) report data that CDER and CBER have collected for over thirty years to identify, explore, and validate signals of product related safety issues. These AE reports are stored electronically and accessed by FDA staff through the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS). Adverse event reports for vaccines are collected by the Center for Disease Control and stored in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Empirica Signal also receives an extract from VAERS. CDER and CBER use Empirica Signal is used to perform a variety of sophisticated statistical analyses on AERS and VAERS data. The AERS data used by Empirica Signal is the result of a data extract from AERS into CBAERS, a data warehouse. Empirica Signal extracts data from CBAERS and VAERS into a staging area, where data management services are performed such as standardizing product names against a product dictionary and running algorithms is used to eliminate duplicate reports. This standardized data set is then extracted from the staging area into the production and development instances for use by Empirica Signal.

Page 1 of 10

A Boundary Document identifies the business need for a proposed investment or project. It includes a brief description of the proposed project's purpose, goals, and scope. It provides sufficient information to justify a decision whether or not the organization should move forward with the development of a full business case. (I02) Project Process The Project Process Agreement (PPA) is used to authorize and document the justifications for using, not using, or combining specific Stage Gate Reviews and the Agreement (PPA) selection of specific deliverables applicable to the investment/project, including the expected level of detail to be provided. (I03) Initiation Stage These documents are used by the Project Manager to engage a critical partner and used Gate Critical Partner by the critical partner to record stage gate review results. E-mail Sample and Checklist (I04) Initiation Stage The Stage Gate Review Report and Lessons Learned documents the results of the Stage Gate Review Report Gate including Critical Partner responsibilities, stage gate deliverable final scores, and Lessons Learned mandatory exit criteria final scores, known issues and risks, lessons, learned, scoring summary, and recommendation. INITIATION STAGE GATE REVIEW The Initiation Stage Gate Review considers whether the Boundary Document justifies proceeding to the Concept Phase for development of a full Business Case and preliminary Project Management Plan. CONCEPT STAGE (C01) Business Case The Business Case is a documented, structured proposal for business improvement that is prepared to facilitate a selection decision for a proposed investment or project by organizational decision makers. The Business Case describes the reasons and justification for the investment or project in terms of business process performance, needs and/or problems, and expected benefits. It identifies the high-level requirements that are to be satisfied, an analysis of proposed alternative solutions (with reasons for rejecting or carrying forward each option), assumptions, constraints, a risk-adjusted cost-benefit analysis, and preliminary acquisition strategy. The Business Case should also include a Preliminary Acquisition Strategy. This FIPS-199 publication establishes security categories for both information and information systems. The security categories are based on the potential impact on an organization should certain events occur which jeopardize the information and information systems needed by the organization to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. Security categories are to be used in conjunction with vulnerability and threat information in assessing the risk to an organization.

(C02) Project Security Categorization

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 ATTACHMENT 5 FDA EPLC ARTIFACT DESCRIPTION

Page 2 of 10

Artifact Artifact Description (C03) Privacy Impact Based on the initial FIPS 199 categorization and the identification of the need or potential to collect Privacy Act data/information, the assessment required by the Privacy Analysis (PIA) Act and/or E-Government Act of 2002 to conduct assessments on investments before developing or procuring information technology that collects, maintains, or disseminates personal information in identifiable form. A PIA is an agency review of how collected information is handled by and protected in a manner consistent with Federal standards for privacy and security. The PIA determines what kind of information in identifiable form is contained within a system, what is done with that information, and how that information is protected. Though the PIA specifically refers to "privacy", a PIA also typically covers confidentiality, access to data, and use of data. (C04) System of Any system that contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is subject to the Records Notice Privacy Act. SORNs are required of those Privacy Act systems. Each system requires a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA); however, multiple systems may use a single SORN (SORN) (if applicable). The SORN is a document used to categorize both: individuals covered by the system and records in the system. The SORN also displays the routine uses of the information disclosed and how the system of records affects an individual's rights. Finally, SORNs acknowledge the types of users accessing the system, purpose for accessing and what security controls are in place. (C05) EAuthentication A form used to determine if a System (1) is an outward-facing system, that is, available on the Internet or Extranet, (2) requires User Authentication and (3) contains Confidential, Proprietary, or Personal Identifying Information. If the aforementioned conditions exist, the entire form must be filled out in order to determine appropriate assurance levels used in authentication per NIST SP 800-63.

(C06) Project Charter The Project Charter formally authorizes a project, describes the business need for the project and the product to be created by the project. It provides the project manager with the authority to apply up to a certain level of organizational resources to project activities. (C07) Business Requirements Document (C08) Concept Stage Gate Critical Partner E-mail Sample and Checklist (C09) Concept Stage Gate Review Report and Lessons Learned A business requirements document (BRD) details the business solution for a project including the documentation of customer needs and expectations. These documents are used by the Project Manager to engage a critical partner and used by the critical partner to record stage gate review results.

CONCEPT STAGE GATE REVIEW

The Stage Gate Review Report and Lessons Learned documents the results of the Stage Gate including Critical Partner responsibilities, stage gate deliverable final scores, mandatory exit criteria final scores, known issues and risks, lessons, learned, scoring summary, and recommendation. The Concept Stage Gate Review is a formal inspection of a proposed IT project by the IT governance organization to determine if it is a sound, viable, and worthy of funding, support and inclusion in the organization's IT Investment Portfolio. The outcomes of the Concept Phase are selection to the HHS IT Investment Portfolio; approval of initial project cost, schedule and performance baselines; and issuance of a Project Charter.

Artifact DEVELOPMENT STAGE GATE REVIEW

Page 6 of 10

Artifact Description The Development Stage Gate Review evaluates whether the project should be promoted to the test environment and proceed to the Test Phase for testing.

TEST STAGE (T01) Master Test Plan The Master Test Plan defines the types of tests (e.g. unit, function, integration, system, security, performance (load and stress), regression, user acceptance, and/or independent verification and validation) to be carried out. The document describes the acceptance criteria for those tests, roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the testing process, traceability matrix, resources required (hardware and software environments), and other elements relevant to test planning and execution. This plan details the manner of testing (test cases, simulation, etc) of the integrated software/hardware system. The Unit and Integration section describes the testing process to be executed on the lowest level of development (e.g., module, screen, database trigger, etc.) in terms of the functions to be tested, pass/fail criteria, testing approach, resource requirements, and schedules. Note that this testing will also exercise any interfaces and interactions with the target hardware to be employed. The Performance Test section describes how performance testing will be conducted to evaluate the compliance of system or component performance requirements. The Section 508 Compliance Test section describes how testing will be conducted to verify the Section 508 technical standards which ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) that is comparable to the access to and use of EIT by federal employees without disabilities. The User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Test section details who the UAT is executed to verify that the application is ready and can be used by the end-users to perform the business functions and tasks the application was designed to accomplish. UAT detail is dependent upon a mutually agreed level of formality determined necessary by the FDA Project Manager and Business Sponsor for a given test release. This documents the analysis of the security functional requirements and will identify the protection requirements for the system using a formal risk assessment process. The risk assessment includes the identification of threats to and vulnerabilities in the information system; the potential impact or magnitude of harm that a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability would have on agency assets or operations and the identification and analysis of security controls for the information system. The Security Control Assessment is conducted by testing controls in the development environment, interviewing key staff and examining current procedures in place. Release Test Plan is designed for use in conjunction with the Master Test Plan. Following the initial deployment, the Release Test Plan is completed for each new project release to describe the test compliances and/or temporary non-compliances with the Master Test Plan testing approach for a given project release.

The Unit script/case/scenario is a single test instance in terms of input data, test procedure, test execution environment and expected outcome. Test scripts/cases/scenarios also reference test objectives such as verifying compliance with a particular requirement or execution of a particular program path.

(T05) Security Risk Using the same date types identified in the Project Security Categorization and FIPS 199, determining the impact of the system provides security with the appropriate Assessment baseline needed for testing. The Risk Assessment identifies potential vulnerabilities given the determined baseline. (T06) Requirements The Requirement Traceability Matrix allocates an approved requirement specification Traceability Matrix item (by ID Number) to a specific design element, software code and test case. This (RTM) matrix ensures that all requirements from the highest to the lowest level have been implemented in the design, and in the final system. The matrix also ensures that each requirement was properly implemented by the successful execution of a test exercise The matrix starts in the Requirements Analysis phase by tracing the business requirements to the Technical requirements. In the Design phase, the requirements are traced to the design. In the development phase, the design is traced to the developed code and the unit and system test cases. The RTM is finalized in the testing phase when testing is complete. (T07) System Test A report detailing the System tests carried out on the software product, the acceptance Report criteria, roles and responsibilities, resources (hardware and software environments), the pass/fail results (including a list of known defects), recommendations, and other elements used in the review and test execution.

The Contractor, or anyone acting on behalf of the Contractor, shall not refer to this contract in any news release or commercial advertising without first obtaining written consent from the Contracting Officer. The Contractor agrees not to refer to awards in commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the products or services are endorsed or preferred by the federal Government or are considered by the Government to be superior to other products or services. Disclosure of Information Contractors are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation and resulting contracts and task orders may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Therefore, all items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked. Marking of items will not necessarily preclude disclosure when the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM or The Government) determines disclosure is warranted by FOIA. However, if such items are not marked, all information contained within the submitted documents will be deemed to be releasable. Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract. In performance of this contract, the Contractor assumes responsibility for protection of the confidentiality of Government records and must ensure that all work performed by its subcontractors shall be under the supervision of the Contractor or the Contractor's responsible employees. Each officer or employee of the Contractor or any of its subcontractors to whom any Government record may be made available or disclosed must be notified in writing by the Contractor that information disclosed to such officer or employee can be used only for a purpose and to the extent authorized herein, and that further disclosure of any such information, by any means, for a purpose or to an extent unauthorized herein, may subject the offender to criminal sanctions imposed by 19 U.S.C. § 641.

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 SECTION 5: SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

Page 11 of 55

evaluation will be referred to an individual one level above the Contracting Officer, whose decision will be final. Copies of the evaluations, Contractor responses and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the contract file and may be used to support future award decisions. Agreement to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) The parties agree to use their best efforts to resolve any disputes without litigation. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use ADR as prescribed in Section I - FAR 52.233-1. Organizational Conflicts of Interest As a regulatory agency charged with protection of the public health, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must maintain public confidence in the integrity of its decisions. The FDA has various policies and procedures that safeguard against both actual and apparent conflict of interest (COI) on the part of its employees. It is additionally critical that the FDA be assured that there is no actual or apparent COI on the part of either the Contractor's organization or its individual employees in performance of this contract action. Contractors submitting proposals to perform work under this contract must assure the protection of the information and data they receive in performance or under this contract from unauthorized use or disclosure, and must avoid actions that would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality of the Contractor, its employees, or the Government in the performance of this immediate contract and potential participation in future actions. Contractor will be held to the restrictions of the Organizational Conflict of Interest clause, unless an acceptable mitigation of risk plan is proposed, found acceptable by the Government and enforced. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST SPECIFIC TO THIS CONTRACT Contractors shall review the Statement of Work included in each RFTOP in detail to identify any particular aspects that may present organizational or individual COI, either actual or apparent. DEFINITION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST - Conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons or organizations, a person or organization is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, that the person's or organization's objectivity in performing the contract is or might be otherwise impaired, or that the person or organization has or might acquire an unfair competitive advantage (See FAR 9.501). SUBMITTAL OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN - If it is determined that a COI exists, contractors shall submit a COI Plan which outlines procedures to avoid, neutralize or mitigate COIs, whether actual or apparent, throughout the period of performance of the contract and the restriction period. The plan shall address step-by-step the checks and balances in place to detect potential or actual COI, organizationally and in connection with individual personnel, and shall describe the process of reporting COI to the FDA. It shall contain a statement of consent for FDA to inspect all records, correspondence and other documentation related to COI. If the COI Plan is deemed unacceptable by the FDA, further evaluation of the contractor's proposal may not occur. Upon execution of the task order, the COI Plan shall be incorporated by reference into the task order. The plan should include elements of the following: A. CORPORATE STRUCTURE - The plan shall describe any parent company relationship, and list all affiliates and subsidiaries whose work may present a COI. In addition, the plan shall be updated as soon as there are any changes that may affect work performed under this contract.

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 SECTION 5: SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

Page 12 of 55

Contractors must describe all relevant information concerning any past, present or planned interests that may have a bearing on whether they (including their chief executives and directors, or any proposed consultant or subcontractor) have an organizational conflict of interest in regard to the responsibilities described in the Statement of Work. B. INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE COI/NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS - The COI Plan shall require that ALL employees (any contractor or employee of an contractor, including a Contractor, subcontractors, consultants) performing work under this contract, and/or any work related to this contract, execute a COI/Nondisclosure Agreement. In signing this agreement, the individual agrees to report to the proper authority within the Company, as identified by the Company, information that may affect a determination of individual COI, whether actual, apparent, or potential. This means that employees must disclose/identify all specific financial interests (e.g., stocks, stock options, bonds) and activities (e.g., other employment and consulting). The COI/Nondisclosure Agreement must also contain a statement assuring FDA that the individuals who will be performing work under this contract have read and understand the company's COI plan and procedures. A list of those employees who have done so shall be retained by the company. The COI/Nondisclosure Agreement should include, but need not be limited to, the following: 1) An assurance that the employee has agreed to act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any individual or organization who has submitted applications, information and/or data to FDA. 2) An assurance that the employee has agreed not to solicit any gift or other item, nor accept any gift or other item, of monetary value exceeding $20 from any person or entity seeking official action from, doing business with, or conducting activities related to the evaluations and work performed under this contract. Aggregate market value of individual gifts should not exceed $50.00 in a calendar year. 3) An assurance that the employee has agreed not to disclose to any unauthorized person any information and/or data within his or her purview, or to which he/she has access as a result of performing work under this contract. 4) An assurance that the employee has agreed not to engage in financial transactions using nonpublic information or allow the improper use of such information to further any private interest. 5) An assurance that the employee has agreed not to participate in any matter involving specific parties who are likely to or can directly affect the employee's own financial interest or the financial interests of a member of his household or a relative with whom they have a close personal relationship. 6) Employees shall disqualify themselves from participating in particular matters involving former employers, or their representatives, and from whom they have worked within the past one (1) year. FDA will, upon request, provide information to contractors on the COI standards it applies to its personnel. These standards may be adopted in the COI Plan as one means of safeguarding against individual COI. C. ANNUAL SUBMISSION OF COI/NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS - The COI Plan shall describe the company process for submission of annual COI/Nondisclosure Agreements for both the organization and for individual employees (if performance of the immediate contract plus the restriction period extends beyond one year).

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 SECTION 5: SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

Page 13 of 55

D. NOTIFICATION - The COI Plan shall clearly delineate who has the official responsibility for making COI determinations and clearances within the Contractor's organization. Generally, this is someone at a mid to upper level of management. This official shall be free of any personal conflict for the purpose of making COI determinations, (e.g., a program manager who received bonuses based on the total amount of sales may not be free of any conflicts). Each employee shall be cleared by the Contractor as free of COI prior to performing under this contract. Should the Contractor believe that a potential for conflict exists, the individual may not be assigned to, or perform under, this contract in any manner. If the Contractor has difficulty in determining whether a potential or actual conflict exists, the Contractor shall submit a written request for resolution of the issue within 14 days to the Contracting Officer. The Contractor agrees to make available to the FDA, on demand, all disclosures of employment and financial interests for all individual employees performing work under this contract. E. CORRECTIVE ACTION - The plan shall clearly identify the process that is required when notifying the FDA of any actual, apparent, or potential organizational or individual COI, and the action that the company has taken or will take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate the COI. The plan shall describe corrective actions, which may include any actions necessary to remedy or prevent a potential infringement of COI by the employee or the organization, including but not limited to restitution, change of assignment, disqualification, divestiture, or termination of an activity. F. TRAINING - The COI Plan shall describe how all employees are trained in the basics of COI. An employee should receive COI training as soon as possible after being assigned to work on the FDA contract. Thereafter, employees should receive COI awareness training (annual, if performance of the immediate contract plus the restriction period extends beyond one year) that shall include, at a minimum, a review of the nondisclosure agreement language and any changes to the company's COI Plan. In addition, the company's COI Plan shall be available for all employees to review. The contractor is encouraged to routinely disseminate all current COI information to its employees. Conditions of Performance In addition to the performance requirements set forth under this contract, the Contractor may be required to comply with the requirements of any revisions in legislation or regulations, which may be enacted or implemented during the period of performance of this contract and which are directly applicable to the performance requirements of this contract. In the event that amendments to legislation are enacted or regulations are revised and do impact the performance requirements of this contract, the Contractor will have an opportunity to assess the cost and schedule impacts of such revisions. Automated Information Systems Security and Disaster Recovery The Computer Security Act of 1987 requires that all U.S. Government personnel and Contractors who use computers as part of their work activities complete training on computer security awareness annually. The FDA has recently implemented a General User Security Awareness training program, as well as rolebased Security Training for Senior Executives, Program and Functional Managers, ISSO's, and System Administrators. The ISSO Online Computer Security Awareness Training course will provide the Contractor with detailed information on the security policies and procedures of the FDA. Specifically, the program aims to identify the specific roles and responsibilities of Information Systems Security Officers as they relate to the security posture of the FDA and its Centers. The Contractor agrees to comply with the Automated Data Processing (ADP) system security requirement

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 SECTION 5: SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

Page 14 of 55

set forth in the DHHS, Information Resources Management (IRM) Circular No. 10, AIS Security Program; the FDA Automated Information Systems Security Program; all federal provisions, guidelines, and directives as describe by OMB, NIST, HHS and FDA. The Contractor further agrees to include this provision in any subcontract awarded pursuant to this prime contract. The Contractor agrees to provide (1) an annual certification (Letter of Affirmation) that the Contractor's security and disaster recovery are in compliance with FDA requirements, (2) proof of a valid and in-force Systems Security Certification, and (3) proof of a valid and in-force Disaster Recovery Plan that ensures, for both the Contractor's existing and proposed future facilities, full recovery of all critical services for the work required under this contract. The annual certification required under this paragraph shall be provided and signed under oath by the corporate officer or representative having legal authority to bind the Contractor in the performance of this contract. The Government will specify any unique computer security requirements for any task order that requires development, modification or integration of systems that require compliance with FDA security policies. Security Audits The Government intends to establish a central audit log of key events and activities that can be used to reconstruct, review, and examine system events. The Government will define security audit policies, configuration, thresholds, and priority of events during a consultative process with the Contractor at a future date. The Contractor shall manage and operate an audit service that consolidates audit data in a central EMPIRICA SIGNAL location. The Contractor shall provide the capability to generate predefined and ad hoc reports based on centralized audit requirements. FDA 1335 Personnel Security Clearance Requirements (AUG 2006) BACKGROUND The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), requires that DHHS employees and contractor employees (including subcontractors) who will be working in a DHHS-owned or leased space and/or who will have access to DHHS equipment, and non-public privileged, proprietary, or trade secret information, undergo a background investigation of some type. Contractor employees who will be in DHHS-owned or lease space for less than thirty (30) days are exempted from the background investigation requirement. These contractor employees must be escorted at all time while in DHHS-owned or leased space. GENERAL The contractor shall submit the following items to the Contracting Officer, ten (10) calendar days prior to commencement of work under this contract: a. Certification that all required security form packets and a list of contractor employees names for whom the requisite security information has been provided to Division of Security Operations, Policy and Planning, Personnel Security Staff. b. "Contractor's Commitment to Protect Non-public Information Agreement" forms signed by each employee named in paragraph a. above.

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 SECTION 5: SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

Page 15 of 55

With the exception of costs associated with fingerprinting Contractor employees outside of the FDA Personnel Security Office, the Government will conduct all required background investigations at no cost to the contractor. The cost of fingerprinting Contractor employees at any location other than the FDA Personnel Security Office will be borne by the Contractor. Contractor employees shall obtain security badges in order to access to DHHS-owned or leased property without an escort. (See Section 3 for details on the badging process) However, in the event that work must commence before security badges can be issued, contractor employees will be allowed onto DHHSowned or leased property, but must be escorted at all times. All Contractor employees who undergo a background investigation are required to log onto the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP) system to complete the forms necessary to initiate their background investigations. The forms required vary with the position risk levels for the contract. The position risk levels will be identified in each individual task order. Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1) - Positions which involve the lowest degree of adverse impact on the efficiency of the Agency. The forms set forth by CHART A are required for Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1). Contractor employees assigned to Level 1 who receive a security badge will be required to provide additional security information for a background investigation as specified in Paragraph 5 below. Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6) - Positions in which the incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish public confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned Government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs. The forms set forth by CHART B are required for Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6). Contractor employees assigned Levels 5 or 6 must receive security badge as well as a background investigation. In order to access the e-QIP system, Contractor employees must provide the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist with the following information: (a) full name; (b) position title; (c) social security number; (d) date of birth; (e) place of birth; (f) email address; and (g) phone number. The Personnel Security Specialist will use this information to initiate each Contractor employee into the e-QIP system. Once this is done, each Contractor employee will receive an email that contains a web link to access the e-QIP system, as well as instructions and additional forms needed to initiate the suitability background investigation. The Project Officer for the contract will provide the name of the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist to the Contractor. A Contractor's failure to comply with the e-QIP processing guidelines will result in that Contractor's employees being denied access to FDA property until all security processing has been completed. BADGING PROCESS The FDA Project Officer will sponsor Contractor employees on the FDA Form 3391 for the purpose of obtaining an FDA Security Access Card. In order to obtain one, a contractor employee must receive a "favorable" fingerprint return. Fingerprints must be submitted to the Personnel Security Office at least ten (10) days prior to the commencement of work. Fingerprints will be submitted in one of two ways, depending on where the contract will be performed: Contractor employees who will work in the Washington D.C. metro area will, at the direction of the FDA Project Officer or his/her designee, contact the Personnel Security Branch to schedule a fingerprinting appointment, or Contractor employees who will work in a field office will submit fingerprints to: Food and Drug Administration

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1 titled, "Instructions to Offerors ­Commercial" (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition and is available at website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/12.htm#P257_45709. (ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition. (x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009). This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. The contracting officer will review the vendor's online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete. If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.

FULL TEXT 52.209-5 -- Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following provision: Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples.

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 SECTION 8: SOLICITATION PROVISIONS

Page 33 of 55

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

B. VOLUME II: IDIQ CONTRACT BUSINESS / PRICING INSTRUCTIONS IDIQ BUSINESS PROPOSAL IDIQ Labor Rate Pricing Sheet ATTACHMENT 8 The Contractor's shall provide pricing for labor categories in the attached Labor Rate Tables and include in the Volume 3: Business Proposal Instructions. See Attachment 3 for a detailed description of each labor category. The tables contain hourly rates for both Government site and contractor site. The hourly rates for each labor category shall be fully burdened to include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and/or profit. The contractor shall fill out tab two, titled, Basis of Estimate (BOE), by providing a breakdown of their fully burdened r4ates by Profit, General and Administrative costs, overhead costs, Facility Capital Costs, and any other allowable / allocable costs. The pricing schedules shall a) serve as a list of the ceiling prices that the Government shall pay for any particular CLIN (in fixed price or time and material type task orders) and b) be used as a tool for estimating the reasonableness and realism of proposed costs (in cost reimbursement type contracts). Limitations: c) Under fixed price or time and material type task orders, the Government shall not pay a price for a CLIN in excess of the ceiling established in the Pricing Schedule. TAB 2: Sample-BOE: This worksheet provides a sample Labor BOE to assist the Offeror with their pricing derivation Task Order Business Proposal (ATTACHMENT 9) Task Order 1 Business Proposal shall be prepared in accordance with the technical proposal instruction (pg. 44) and seperately tabbed in Volume 3 "Business Proposal".

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 IDIQ INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS
Volume III: Past Performance

Page 41 of 55

This volume shall describe the Offeror's success in performing comparable contracts/orders. The Past Performance Volume shall be no more than three pages, i.e., no more than one page narrative per contract/order. The Offeror shall submit directly to the Government: ˇ A list of three contracts/orders, similar in scope, duration, and price to the work described in the SOW. These may be, but do not need to be, the same contracts/orders described in Section 2 of the Technical Volume. The Offeror shall adhere to the following guidelines in generating this list: o o o o o o Contracts or orders must have been completed within three years of the quote due date. The list may include contracts/orders on which the Offeror served as a subcontractor, provided that the subcontract was similar in scope, duration, and price to this effort. The list should include both a contractual and technical point of contact (email addresses and phone numbers) for each of the contracts/orders. If a subcontract is being used as a past performance reference, contact information for the prime contractor, not the customer, should be included. The list should include the contract/order number, title (if appropriate), the period of performance, and the dollar value of the contract/order. If the contract/order is not described in Section 1 of the Technical Volume, the Offeror shall include a one page narrative the contract/order, describing the nature of the work performed and emphasizing outcomes reached.

The Offeror should also send the Past Performance Questionnaire attached to the RFQ to the sources that it identifies in the Past Performance Volume. The questionnaires should be sent to the individual most knowledgeable about the Offeror's performance on the identified order or program (e.g. the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative; the Program/Project Manager; or the Contracting Officer). Each reference must complete the questionnaire and mail a hard copy to the Contract Specialist. The Offeror may opt to allow the return of completed questionnaires to the Government via electronic mail. This is solely at the discretion of the Offeror, with the understanding that e-mail systems, servers, Internet, intranets and extranets are not considered secure. The Offeror shall ensure that all the point of contacts complete and return the questionnaires to the Government prior to the RFQ close date. Offerors are cautioned that the Government may use data provided by each offeror as well as data obtained from possible other Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) Department of Defense's (DOD) Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRs) in the evaluation of past performance.

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 IDIQ INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS
PART II: Subcontracting Plan

Page 42 of 55

If the offeror is other than a small business concern, it must submit a Subcontracting Plan (see Attachment 4). Submitted Plans must address subcontracting with small business (SB), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. This plan will be the equivalent of a master subcontracting plan for the overall IDIQ contract. Individual subcontracting plans should also be submitted for each task order over $550,000 for other than small business concerns. (The contractor is required to submit the approved task order subcontracting plan to OSDBU.)

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 SECTION 13: IDIQ CONTRACT EVALUATION CRITERIA
IDIQ CONTRACT EVALUATION CRITERIA

Page 43 of 55

a. The Government may award an IDIQ contract and one task order without discussions in accordance with FAR Part 52.215-1. b. The Government intends to evaluate offerors in accordance with this Section of the RFP and make contract award to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value to the U.S. Government. c. The submitted technical information will be evaluated by a technical evaluation committee using the technical criteria shown below. The evaluation committee may include industry experts who are not employees of the Federal Government. When evaluating the competing offerors, the Government will consider the written information provided by the offerors and any other information obtained by the Government through its own research. (d) For overall evaluation purposes, technical factors are considered significantly more important than price/cost factors. (e) Determination of Competitive Range: The competitive range of offerors with whom negotiations will be conducted (if necessary) will be determined by the Contracting Officer pursuant to FAR 15.306(c). A competitive range determination (if necessary) may take place at any point in the evaluation process. Offerors are advised that, in accordance with FAR 52.215-1, if the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals The technical evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance. Sub-criteria under any particular evaluation criterion shall be weighted equally. Proposals will be rated as: exceptional; good; acceptable; marginal; or unacceptable. Each factor will be evaluated on the basis of these adjectives except past performance (which will be rated as low-risk, neutral or high-risk). This evaluation will be conducted using a best value methodology. Technical merit will be significantly more important than price in evaluating quotes. All price proposals will be evaluated to determine whether the pricing is reasonable; however, the lowest-priced offeror will not necessarily be awarded the order. In the event that two or more offeror's technical proposals are deemed to be of similar merit, price will be determining factor. FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING SUBFACTOR 1: TECHNICAL APPROACH ˇ FDA will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror understands the technical requirements and has a coherent, feasible and efficient approach to providing the services required. SUBFACTOR 2: Task Order Proposal ˇ FDA will evaluate the appropriateness of contractor's proposed technical approach for Task Order. FACTOR 2: Relevant Experience: FDA will evaluate the extent to which narratives demonstrate successful performance on contract similar in size, scope, complexity and value. Specifically the company's experience in data mining efforts.

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 SECTION 13: IDIQ CONTRACT EVALUATION CRITERIA

Page 44 of 55

FACTOR 3: Management Plan: FDA will evaluate the appropriateness of the offeror's management plan, considering methodologies, preparation, performance measures, task order managemetn, management tools, cost control, schedule control, quality control, communications and retention/recruitment.

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 SECTION 13: IDIQ CONTRACT EVALUATION CRITERIA
IDIQ CONTRACT BUSINESS PROPOSAL PRICE EVALUATION: Labor Rates (Attachment: 8: IDIQ Labor Rate and BOE Pricing Sheet)

Page 45 of 55

FDA will evaluate the appropriateness of the proposed labor mix and the reasonableness of the proposed Labor rates. FDA will determine reasonableness of the contractor's proposed Labor Rates by utilizing one or several of the following price realism techniques: comparing the proposed ceiling amounts against rates previously paid by the FDA for similar work, rates previously charged by the contractor for similar work, standard market labor rates for similar labor categories. FDA reserves the right to review the contractor's labor rates on the General Service Administration (if applicable) and the right to seek price information from other commercial and Government sources. Unrealistically low proposed rates (initially or subsequently) may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror either doesn't understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic quote.

The FDA will evaluate the proposed pricing for Task Order 1: CDER / CBER Support (Attachment 9).

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 SECTION 13: IDIQ CONTRACT EVALUATION CRITERIA
PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

Page 46 of 55

The FDA will evaluate past performance as a risk assessment; not as a weighted technical evaluation factor. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offer. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offer.

TASK ORDER PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA EVALUATION GENERAL EVALUATION INFORMATION

Page 53 of 55

The contractor's proposed technical approach for task order 1 is a sub factor evaluation criterion for the single award IDIQ contract. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each task proposal and potential performance. Risk is defined as the likelihood that the Government will be negatively impacted by the Offeror's failure to meet the negotiated business, technical management, and schedule performance, and cost for this task order. The following technical factors are listed in descending order of importance and shall be used to evaluate task order proposals. Sub factors are listed in descending order of importance as well: Factor 1 ­ Technical Capability Sub factor 1: Technical Understanding and Approach Sub factor 2: Solutions to Scenarios Factor 2 ­ Task Order Management Approach Factor 3 ­ Qualifications of Key Personnel Factor 4 - Task Order Business Proposal The FDA will evaluate task order technical proposals adjectivally as Excellent, Highly Acceptable, Acceptable, Minimally Acceptable or Unacceptable. The task order rating will be considered in the overall technical rating for the IDIQ contract and subsequently award of the task order. Technical Evaluation Factor 1 - Technical Capability Sub-Factor 1 Technical Approach and Understanding FDA will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror's proposal demonstrates that: ˇ The Offeror understands the requirement; ˇ Has described tasks and procedures that will result in timely execution of the services; ˇ Will provide a level of effort and mix of resources capable of implementing the technical solution described; and ˇ Understands the risks associated with the services and has proposed strategies will mitigate those risks Sub-Factor 2 Solutions to Scenarios FDA will evaluate the extent to which responses demonstrate an understanding of the resources and constraints in the FDA environment and can address the types of issues likely to arise during performance of the contract. Factor 2 ­ Task Order Management Approach FDA will evaluate the extent to which the proposed management approach effectively controls / oversees task order cost, schedule, performance, quality, and risk.

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 TASK ORDER PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA
Factor 3 - Qualifications of Key Personnel

Page 54 of 55

FDA will evaluate the extent to which: ˇ Key personnel have defined responsibilities and those responsibilities align with technical solution, specifically their experience in data mining efforts such as data standardization, duplicate identification of large databases. ˇ Key Personnel have skills/education necessary for successful leadership.

FDA-SOL-10-1071337 TASK ORDER PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

TASK ORDER BUSINESS PROPOSAL EVALUATION CRITERIA The task order business proposal rating is a sub factor for award of the IDIQ contract. Fair and Reasonable Price The Government will evaluate the Contractor's ability to deliver efficient, risk-free performance at a fair and reasonable price. As part of this evaluation, the Government will evaluate: ˇ Overall pricing for the following Task Order Tasks: Project Administration, Operations and Maintenance, Customer Support, and Training (and breakdown of pricing by number of hours, labor categories, and the pre-negotiated fully loaded rate charged)

Price Realism The FDA's evaluation of price realism will consider the extent to which proposed pricing indicates a clear understanding of solicitation requirements, reflects a sound approach to satisfying those requirements, and is consistent with the approach described in the offeror's technical volume. The price realism assessment will consider technical and management risks identified during evaluation of the quote. Unrealistically low proposed prices (initially or subsequently) may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror either doesn't understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic quote.
