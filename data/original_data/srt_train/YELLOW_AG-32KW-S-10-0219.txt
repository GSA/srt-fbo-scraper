To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 

(2) 

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to:

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at  or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and

(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.

(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.

(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.

(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.

(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 

(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.

(2)

(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—

(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.

(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.

(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

Veterinary Services Process Streamlining (VSPS)

Task Background

Animal Health & Surveillance Management Background

The Animal Health and Surveillance Management (AHSM) System is an enterprise-level animal health and surveillance electronic information management system which manages surveillance data for numerous species and diseases. Animal health surveillance relies heavily on testing animals for specific diseases and reporting those test results to facilitate the management, prevention, investigation, control and eradication of animal diseases.  

This surveillance work also enables VS to rapidly provide information to our trading partners concerning the assurance our food-producing animals’ health status and the certification of animals and their products for export (which is a multi-billion dollar per-year industry). The Animal Health & Surveillance System has a need for a comprehensive and integrated animal health management Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) surveillance software product.   

More detailed information on the requirements of an AHSM comprehensive and integrated animal health surveillance management system are found in Sec. 1.2.4 below.

Inclusive of this need is the capability to meet the specific requirements of Aquaculture surveillance and Swine Health H1N1 surveillance as described in Sec. 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 below: 

Aquaculture  Surveillance Management Background

It is the intent that the comprehensive and integrated animal health management Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) surveillance software product meet the needs of aquaculture surveillance in addition to the needs of animal health surveillance for other species as well.  The activities, processes and requirements of animal health surveillance are very similar regardless of the species and disease.

In 2001, the Joint Subcommittee on Aquaculture (JSA), a venue for Federal interagency collaboration, under the auspices of the Executive Office of the President, Office of Science and Technology Policy, commissioned the development of a national aquatic animal health plan (NAAHP). The NAAHP can be found at: . The Federal agencies with primary responsibility for aquatic animal health — the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) — lead the effort to develop this plan.  The NAAHP encompasses primarily farmed and wild finfish, crustaceans and mollusks; however amphibians and aquatic reptiles are also gaining in importance particularly as they relate to trade.  Key recommendations of the NAAHP involved issues related to disease reporting, surveillance, laboratory testing and zonation.  The common link between these issues is a need for a centralized, secure information system containing reliable and useful data.

The vision of the application as proposed by the NAAHP will provide states, tribes, industry, the Federal government and other stakeholders with the tools necessary to 

(1) Support reporting of aquatic animal diseases in accordance with US international obligations; 

(2) develop appropriate measures to protect their aquatic animal resources; 

(3) support movement and certification documentation; 

(4) Produce reports, maps and other documentation for surveillance and disease management purposes.

Additional information about APHIS involvement in the NAAHP can be located at: 

H1N1 Background

Based on direction from the Secretary’s office, VS is to utilize funding made available by Congress to enhance the ability to collect data related to H1N1 in the United States swine population.  AHSM currently isn’t built to accept this data stream.  Instead, this data is captured through a series of manual processes and spread sheets. This RFP will provide the opportunity to identify functionality potentially already available in a COTS software product to enhance our ability to capture this data.   Additional information about H1N1 can be found at:  

Comprehensive and Integrated Animal Health Surveillance Management Details

Animal health & Surveillance Management consists of a series of field level activities performed by Federal & State animal health professionals.  The objective of the AHSM IT system is to provide IT application support for those activities.  The following example correlates the relationship to the most common field level activities and the objectives of the IT system.

The ‘Chain of Animal Health Surveillance’

1st Link.) Maintain core animal health data and manage regulatory work 

AHSM will provide a repository for core animal disease program data such as information regarding animal premises and groups, individual animals and contact information for associated persons.  This data and functionality is critical to managing animal disease certification and quality assurance programs, for providing the base data needed to analysis surveillance data, and to effectively take action when required.    

2nd Link.) Collecting Animal Specimens for Disease Testing

Data acquisition begins with animal health practitioners in the field collecting specimens from animals at farms and other facilities.  These specimens are collected by veterinarians to test for the presence of animal diseases.  AHSM will provide field data collection support through the use of mobile information management (MIM).  Devices such as PDAs, (Personal Digital Assistants) increase the speed, accuracy and efficiency of data collection while providing an improved benefit to cost ratio.

3nd Link.) Testing the Specimens for Disease

The specimens are sent to federal, state, and university diagnostic laboratories to determine the results.  In many cases, information about the specimens can be transmitted electronically to and from the laboratories via AHSM.

4rd Link.) Reporting the results

Timely reporting of laboratory results is critical in animal health surveillance.  The greater the elapsed time before detection the greater the opportunity for disease spread.  AHSM provides for test results to be transmitted electronically and can generate instant email alerts to the appropriate animal health officials.

5th Link.) Analyzing the results

The reporting capability of AHSM provides data for analysis by animal disease program epidemiologists and managers and by animal health analysts at the APHIS Centers for Epidemiological & Animal Health (CEAH) and other USDA organizations.  This analysis is for many different purposes, such as evaluating patterns, rate of spread, and emerging threats to the animal health population.  These data are critical for maintaining and developing trade by providing assurance to our trading partners that our animals and animal products are safe for export. These data also allow APHIS to take steps to contain or eliminate foci of infection.

6th Link.) Taking action

When a detection of a regulated animal disease occurs, APHIS must take immediate action.  The AHSM system will provide critical data support for investigations, recording the response that was taken, and scheduling response activities needed in the future.   Responses to endemic program diseases are typically managed utilizing AHSM.

If a foreign disease outbreak is determined to have occurred or if a task force is need to address an occurrence of an endemic disease, the APHIS Emergency Management Response System (EMRS) is activated to manage the APHIS response to the disease outbreak.  Animal health data collected by EMRS is transferred to AHSM.  

Responses may include:

Further investigation and testing

Tracing of potentially exposed animals

Quarantine and/or euthanasia of infected or exposed animals

Vaccination, genotyping or other responses when appropriate based on the epidemiology of the disease



Veterinary Services Workflow

VS Core Services

The core services include performing surveillance on animals in order to estimate prevalence of disease, investigating the health status of animals in order to detect disease, and applying disease control measures. Additional core functions include enforcing laws and regulations that protect animal health and commercial agriculture interests, developing policies and plans that support animal health efforts, informing people about animal health issues, and mobilizing and linking animal health service providers to identify and solve health problems.



VS Workflow Units

The organizational units used to describe workflows will range from the lowest granularity (Task) to the highest (Service). Activity Groups will be used to group related activities.

Task: A discrete action or piece of work such as drawing a blood sample or assessing a caudal fold (CF) test. 

Activity: A group of tasks which achieve an objective. For example, a TB CF herd test includes the tasks of scheduling the test, coordinating the resources, injecting the animals, with tuberculin, recording the premises and animal information, assessing the response, recording and reporting the results. An activity is equivalent to a reportable event, which is often recorded on an official form (ex: VS Form 6-22 is used to record a TB CF test). A VS activity ‘generates’ data that are used for managing, reporting, forecasting, and analysis.

Activity Group: a set of related activities; VS activities can be assigned to one of two categories – 

Evaluation of a place (premises, zone) or thing (animal group, individual animal , product, fomite, vector)

Management of a place or thing.

Service: a basic Veterinary Services mission area. These mission areas are…

Prevention (exclusion)

Detection (surveillance)

Response (control/eradication/recovery)



The service, activity and task workflow units are primarily meant to represent meaningful triggers for data collection.  They should serve to provide the proper context for accurate interpretation of the data collected.  They may also be used to prioritize data quality improvement efforts.  In combination with the reason for activity, the level of usefulness of data elements included in the data collection to meet the service objectives can be evaluated.  The workflow units may also be useful for connecting traceable processes used to evaluate how appropriate, timely, and relevant the data supplied were for meeting the needs of those responsible for analysis and interpretation.




OBJECTIVE OF THIS RFP

This solicitation is for the acquisition, implementation and support of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software product for comprehensive and integrated animal health management surveillance.. This acquisition also includes the migration of data from VS legacy animal health databases into the COTS product.



 The use of comprehensive and integrated animal health management surveillance software is vital to the Veterinary Services mission to securely store, analyze, and report on various data. This software will fulfill the business needs of animal health surveillance Veterinary Service’s (VS) programs and specific needs relative to the VS Aquaculture and H1N1 business programs.  



Consideration will only be given to commercially available software that is currently offered to the marketplace to meet these needs.  It is the goal of the VS-CIO that the COTS product should have the ability to meet Veterinary Services' business requirements without  enhancements or modifications, other than configuration modifications needed to install the software.  High-level business and technical requirements are defined in greater detail in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet described in the ‘Evaluation Criteria’ section of this document.



Federal and State Veterinary animal health professionals will be the primary users of this software.




SCOPE OF TASK

In addition to the minimum standards expressed above, the Offeror shall also provide in their proposal the standards for optimum performance based on a load matrix.

The installation on the Federal system must have a flexible role-based security that will restrict the user’s visibility and access to data.   Most users should be confined to view data related only to their state.  However, certain users must be permitted to view data at Regional and National levels.   

All roles will have a specific range of security controls.  To establish these permissions each user must be created with enough data known about them to apply the associated security measures.   This data includes the assigned state(s) for which they are assigned, and other pertinent identifying information.   For example:  >  Data Entry personnel will only be permitted to search for, add or create data (persons, herds, fish schools, etc.) for the state or other geographic region to which they are assigned.  For example a user in Utah could not search for, view or update premises in Colorado.  Conversely, National, Regional, or area program or lab managers – can read all records and reports for their designated area of responsibility. 





CLIN 03 Additional site COTS software installation:	



The deliverable of this CLIN shall be the acquisition and installation of the commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) comprehensive and integrated animal health management surveillance software on additional sites as awarded. 



The purpose of additional sites is to provide States with the ability to exercise local control of their site; data center management; user management; data management/ownership, etc.  It is the intention of the Government to maintain concurrency of software versions between the Federal system and all additional sites.  



VS-OCIO additional sites will consist of site locations for which Veterinary Services has business relationships.  Typically, these sites will be: 



Offices of the APHIS Veterinary Services (VS) Area Veterinarian-in-Charge (AVIC),

(e) The following EVMS variance analysis:

• Cost variance = (BCWP minus ACWP)

• Cost Variance % = (CV/BCWP X 100%)

• Cost Performance Index (CPI) = (BCWP/ACWP)

• Schedule Variance = (BCWP minus BCWS)

• Schedule Variance % = (SV/BCWS X 100%)

• Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = (BCWP/BCWS)

• Two independent Estimates at Completion (EAC)

• ACWPcum + 1/CPI X (Budgeted at Completion (BAC) minus BCWP cum)

• ACWPcum + 1/CPI X SPI X BAC minus BCWPcum)

• Variance at Completion (VAC) = (BAC minus EAC) for both EACs above

• Variance at Completion % + (VAC/BAC X 100%) for both EACs above

• Expected Funds to Completion (ETC)

• Expected Completion Date

(f) Explanation of the reasons for all variances.

(g) Performance variance.  Explain, based on work accomplished as of the date of the report, whether the performance goals will be achieved
