Section C - Descriptions and Specifications

PRODUCT SPECIFICATION
   1. 1.    BACKGROUND

The Department of Defense (DoD) established the Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) in 1990 to improve accessibility for people
with disabilities throughout the DoD and remove the cost of accommodations. The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), a field activity in the
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), serves as the executive agent for CAP.  CAP is housed at TMA’s Office of the
Chief Information Officer (OCIO).  CAP's mission is to provide assistive technology and accommodations to ensure people with disabilities and
wounded service members have equal access to the information technology environment and opportunities in DoD and throughout the Federal
Government.  In October 2000, the National Defense Authorization Act granted CAP the authority to provide assistive technology, devices, and
services to any department or agency in the Federal Government upon the request of the head of the agency. Via this authority, CAP is the
Federal Government's centrally funded accommodations program, providing assistive technology solutions at no cost to the requesting agency. Much
of CAP's success lies in the ability to provide assistive technology and reasonable accommodations to employees quickly and easily, which can
increase employment and retention of employees with disabilities.

On October 17, 2006, the National Defense Authorization Act granted CAP the authority to provide assistive technology to wounded/injured service
members allowing them to retain the equipment upon separation.  CAP provides the assistive technology to the service members and coordinates the
service as outlined in the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6025.22.  Since the inception of CAP, procurement of information technology
management support services provided best administrative value to CAP as it expanded and provided over 12,000 assistive technology and
accommodation services to 68 Federal agency partners and wounded Service members in the recent Fiscal Year.

2.    OBJECTIVE

Provide Assistive Technology and Accommodation Services to Federal Employees with disabilities and Wounded Service Members.

3.    SCOPE

This award provides assistive technology to Federal Employees with Low Vision Impairments.


This request is to provide (20) OpenBook User Site Licenses and (20) Pearl Cameras.

    • Pearl with OpenBook
         o The Pearl with OpenBook is a portable solution for blind and low vision impairments. The Pearl Camera snaps pictures of books,
           newspapers, magazines, and other printed material. Then the OpenBook software reads the text out loud. The Pearl in conjunction with
           OpenBook software allows users to read and listen to printed text at the same time.

Brand Name Justification for Pearl with OpenBook.

While there are other products the likes of The Eye-Snap Reader which performs the same functions of the Pearl with OpenBook, the Eye-Snap
Reader is not a portable solution. The Pearl with OpenBook is also the more affordable solution. The customer requires the portability of the
Pearl with OpenBook. The Pearl with OpenBook meets all the customer’s requirements and no other products have been found to meet this need.
Additionally the Pearl with OpenBook is for the NMCI network and is being purchased by PO instead of BPA to accommodate a 20 user site license.
