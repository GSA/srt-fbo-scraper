1.  Purpose.  This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) has been developed to provide the standard of surveillance for monitoring the Time
Reporting Software as a Service (SaaS) contract for Technology Services Organization.  This QASP will provide a systematic approach for
conducting contract surveillance.

The Contracting Officer (CO) will appoint      TBD      as his/her Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) for this contract. COR Contact
information:  (XXX-XXX-XXXX)    __@usmc.mil.  As the COR,       TBD     will also serve as the Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) and will use
this QASP to ensure the standards of the contract are being met.

2.  Performance Standards.  The QASP provides a systematic method to evaluate the service the Contractor is required to furnish.  The COR will
assess the Contractor’s performance to ensure the Contractor is performing up to the specified standards.  The performance standards for this
Performance Work Statement (PWS) are stated in the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) included in this QASP.

3.  Management and Oversight.  The QASP is based on the premise that the Contractor and not the Government, is responsible for the management
and any Quality Control action required to meet the terms of the contract.  The performance requirements recognize that the Contractor is not a
perfect manager and that unforeseen requirements and uncontrollable problems do occur.  Good management and use of an adequate Quality Control
Plan will allow the Contractor to operate within specific performance requirements.  QASPs are designed to be objective, fair and consistent in
evaluating Contractor performance against the provided standards.

4.  Acceptable Quality Levels (AQLs).  AQLs have been established in the PRS and provide performance standards that the Contractor will meet in
performing the contract.  In the event the Contractor does not meet the established AQLs, the Contracting Officer has the right to exercise the
negative incentives stated in this QASP.

5.  Primary Method of Surveillance/Evaluation. Customer feedback (provided to the COR) will be the primary method of surveillance.  If the SaaS
is not available or not working correctly, customers will report the issue to the vendor helpdesk, and the COR. The COR will follow-up with the
vendor, and MARFORRES RCO.  The COR will also perform evaluation based random inspection (a sampling method where each unit of a population
(e.g. trouble tickets, application availability, etc.) has an equal chance of being selected).  These two surveillance methods are anticipated
to successfully mitigate technical performance risk associated with this contract.

6.  Negative Incentives.  If any of the performance requirements do not meet the AQL identified  in the PRS table, the COR shall document the
discrepancy (or discrepancies) and shall notify the Contractor, and the Contracting Officer, promptly.  When the performance is below the AQL
standard, the Government may implement a negative incentive in not exercising the option.

7.  Notification.  The COR will notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, of unacceptable quality levels.  The Contracting Officer will
promptly provide written notification of discrepancies on a monthly basis, or immediately if the situation significantly affects the well-being
of the project.  In the event services rendered are determined not to conform to the terms of the contract, the MARFORRES Contracting Officer
may issue the contractor a corrective action request, and require identification of actions taken to correct the specific nonconformity.
8.  Response.  The Contractor shall provide a written response to the cause and the corrective action to prevent recurrence within 10 working
days after receipt of Contracting Officer’s notification.  The Contractor should cite specific quality assurance program procedures or new
procedures instituted to prevent recurrence.

9.  Records.  The COR will maintain contract surveillance files as directed by the Contracting Officer. Surveillance files will include, in
part, the following documentation for this Firm-Fixed-Price contract:

      a. COR designation and appointment letters


      b. A copy of the contract and all contract modifications


      c. QASP and any other tools, checklists, etc.

      d. All correspondence including Contracting Officer notifications and the Contractor’s responses


      e. Evidence of satisfactory performance provided by random sampling from customer location.


      f. Evidence that all materials/equipment obtained under this contract are accounted for and remain in Government possession.

      g. Quarterly technical reviews



      h. Surveillance reports may be submitted in support of unacceptable performance identified during the performance period by the COR, or
         when there is a significant change in performance that alters the assessment in one or more evaluation areas.




10.  Ratings.  The following criteria will be used for performance evaluations:  Exceptional, Satisfactory, Marginal, or Unsatisfactory.  Upward
or downward arrows may be used to indicate an improving or worsening trend insufficient to change to the assessment status.

      a. Exceptional.  Indicates performance clearly exceeds contractual requirements.  The area of evaluation may contain a few minor problems
      for which corrective action appears highly effective.

      b. Satisfactory.  Indicates performance clearly meets contractual requirements.  The area of evaluation contains some minor problems for
      which the corrective actions appear satisfactory.

      c. Marginal.  Indicates performance meets contractual requirements.  The area of evaluation contains one or more serious problems for which
      corrective actions have not yet been identified, appear only marginally effective, or have not been fully implemented.


      d. Unsatisfactory.  Indicates the Contractor is in danger of not being able to satisfy contractual requirements and recovery is not likely
      in a timely manner.  The area of evaluation contains one or more serious problems for which the corrective actions appear ineffective.


11.   Documentation.  Documentation used and referenced to perform surveillance will consist of monthly reports, random sampling, and individual
customer complaints.

      a. Recording Observations.  Use a Surveillance Log(s) to record information on scheduled observations and deficiencies noted.  Each
      observation is recorded on the log.  The documents then become a formal record for reference.  The Contractor is to be told each time a
      deficiency is found during scheduled observations.  The COR makes a notation on the Surveillance Log of the date and time the deficiency
      was discovered.


      b. Potential Unacceptable Performance.  The COR must identify the specific service that is unacceptable and the possible causes, and ask a
      number of questions which if answered, will probably pinpoint the source of the problem.


      c. Documenting Unacceptable Performance.  The COR must attempt to resolve the problem with the Contractor.  The original log and the
      attempted solution (along with an evaluation of results) are forwarded to the Contracting Officer by the COR.


Based on the severity of the discrepancy and the success of the solution, the COR will notify the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor shall
complete a response to the unacceptable evaluation if requested by the Contracting Officer or by its own choice.

12.  Taking Action.


      a. The COR may evaluate the Contractor’s performance and document any non-compliance, but only the Contracting Officer may take action
      against the Contractor for an unacceptable rating.


      b. When the Contractor’s performance is unacceptable and a formal action is required, the COR will evaluate the specific circumstances and
      make a recommendation to the Contracting Officer as to what action shall be taken.



13.  Documentation.  The COR retains a copy of all inspection schedules and surveillance activity logs during the course of the contract, and
forwards them for inclusion in the contract file at the end of each year of performance.  Notwithstanding, when a specific service becomes
unsatisfactory during a surveillance period, the inspection documentation supporting the contract discrepancy report is promptly forwarded to
the Contracting Officer.

14.  Performance Requirements Summary (PRS).  The performance standards for this PWS are stated in the PRS below.

STATEMENT OF WORK
                                                                Statement of Work

PROJECT TITLE:  SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE PROJECT TIME REPORTING SYSTEM FOR THE MARINE CORPS TECHNICAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION

1.  background

The Marine Corps Technology Services Organization develops and maintains Human Resource (HR) and Payroll applications that service both active
and reserve Marines.  These critical applications are developed within strict CMMI level 3 standards.  All application changes are estimated for
effort in all phases of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).  Actual hours are tracked per application change and compared against the
estimated effort to provide burn reports to software development managers. Non-billable hours are also tracked to include training time, holiday
hours, vacation and administrative time off.

Project time reporting systems development is not a key competency of the TSO and is therefore not best suited to develop or maintain such a
system.  Additionally, the accreditation and certification process timeline for software installed on Marine Corps hosted systems exceeds the
cost of procuring a labor hours tracking system.    Procuring a Project Time Reporting system as a service is the most cost effective solution
for the Marine Corps TSO project time reporting needs.

A future requirement will be to utilize the Project Time Reporting System SaaS to track time off requests and overtime authorizations for the
employees within the TSO.  The Project Time Reporting System SaaS will also be utilized to provide a payroll ready file to the DoD’s Civilian
Payroll System (DCPS).

2. OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE

Objective.   Project Time Reporting Software as a Service (SaaS) will be a software service used by the Marine Corps TSO to report actual hours
worked against SDLC tasks within software application changes and application support tasks.  The SaaS is hosted by a vendor where the Marine
Corps TSO does not take ownership of the application and is instead purchasing access to the application via the internet.   The SaaS system
will replace the features of the existing functionality.

        1. Report Sustainment, Operational Support and Maintenance hours by SDLC and predefined tasks for  each  project,  by  AIS  and  funding
           source and customer.


        2. Provide the capability for supervisors to approve the hours input into the projects and  to  retrieve  burn  rate  reports  by  task,
           project, AIS, funding source and customer.

        3. Provide administrative functions to customize the tasks, projects, AIS, funding source, customers and TSO organization.


        4. Provide the administrative functions to restrict user access to only specified task, projects or AIS.


        5. Provide an adhoc data reporting function to allow supervisors and financial personnel to create custom reports.


        6. Provide the administrative function to create approval and notification workflows for task, project and AIS hours.


        7. Provide user capability to request leave (annual, sick, credit, etc) and overtime.


        8. Provide capability for supervisors to approve leave and overtime requests.


        9. Provide capability for users and supervisors to input or approve time from a mobile computing device.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ___    ) are, ( ___   ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or
declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) ( ___   ) Have, ( ___   ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state
or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or
commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating
Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) ( ___   ) Are, ( ___   ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission
of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (   ___  ) Have, ( ___   ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
