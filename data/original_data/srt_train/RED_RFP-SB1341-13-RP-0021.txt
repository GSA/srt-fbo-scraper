AMENDMENT 0001



VENDOR QUESTIONS/AGENCY RESPONSE



NOTE:  AS A RESULT OF AMENDMENT 0001, THE DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF VENDOR PROPOSAL IS EXTENDED UNTIL 2:00 PM, MONDAY, JANUARY 21, 2013.



THE NAICS CODE ASSIGNED TO THIS REQUIREMENT IS 518210.  THE DOLLAR THRESHOLD FOR NAICS CODE 518210 IS $30 MILLION





QUESTION 1 - If there is a present incumbent that provides Web Conferencing services to NIST.



RESPONSE:  This is a new requirement in support of NIST Information Technology Laboratory.  There is no contractor currently providing this requirement.  However, NIST has used ReadyTalk product/services in the past.



QUESTION 2 - the requirement is for total of 400 licenses, right? (i. At least 20 simultaneous meetings; ii. At least 20 or more participants per meeting ;)



RESPONSE:  A given vendor's specific jargon may vary. However, this interpretation of the requirements ("400 licenses") is atypical from what we have seen, historically.

       Typically, we would have seen a proposal for something ranging from, say, 1 to 20 'licenses' or 'subscriptions' (depending on the terminology) where each one could support meetings hosting certain numbers of users (we require they provide an option to support "at least 20 or more participants per meeting").





QUESTION 3 - confirm that we are to provide our technical approach for performing each of the four categories and sub-categories under the heading Web-conferencing and audio services shall support …. as adequate response for a proposal.



Response:  Vendor shall as part of its proposal, provide its proposed approach to meeting all the Scope of Work requirements categorized under WEB Conferencing and Audio Services.
