SUBJECT: Past Perfonnance Survey for Solicitation HTC711-09-R-0036 The United States Transportation Command is in the process of selecting a contractor who will perfonn general and specific tasks for the continued development and support of its Joint Flow and Analysis System for Transportation (JFAST) program. One of the significant considerations in proposal evaluation is the verification of the offeror's past and present perfonnance on contracts which reflect the offeror's ability to perfonn on the proposed effort. We depend on infonnation received from sources such as yours, which have had first-hand experience with an offeror, for the evaluation of the offeror's perfonnance on those contracts. If infonnation on this particular contractor has been entered into the Contractor Perfonnance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), please annotate this on the front of the survey in the appropriate block. We will use this infonnation, as well as the specific infonnation obtained from this survey, to complete our analysis of an offeror's past perfonnance. Our areas of interest in the offeror are summarized in the enclosed survey. Our schedule is extremely tight and we need your written response not later than 12:00 noon (eDT) on 7 Aug 09. To assist you in preparing your response and expediting your reply, the survey may be typed or handwritten and either scanned and emailed to dominic.curcuru@ustranscom.mil or faxed to 618-256-8316 (DSN 576-8316), Attention: Dominic Curcuru. Please call my office at 618-229-2513 prior to sending a faxed transmission or if you have any questions. Your completed survey will become a part of the official records.

1.0  GENERAL

All proposed pricing for this RFP is to be completed within the enclosed table.  No price information is to be listed within the basic contract
award CLIN structure.  The CLIN structure information is provided for information in regards to the possible  structure of the task orders.

2.0  PRICING OF LABOR RATE TABLE FOR TASK ORDERS

a. All task orders awarded pursuant to this contract will be priced IAW the pricing set forth in the Contract Labor Rate Table and below
instructions. The labor in this section will reflect fully-burdened rates for each category and will apply to all direct labor hours.

b.  LH Labor / FFP Rates:

(1)  Government Site Rates.  When performing at Government sites, the contractor shall furnish fully-burdened personnel rates.  The Government
will provide equipment and property for contractor use only as specified by each task order award, but for pricing purposes can fairly be
expected to include only office space, furniture, supplies, and office equipment (to include computers, at a comparable level to that provided
to collocated government employees).

(2)  Contractor Site Rates.  When performing at a contractor site, the contractor shall furnish fully-burdened personnel rates, which includes
loads for office space and all normal supplies and services required to support the work.  This includes, but is not limited to, telephones,
faxes, copiers, personal computers, postage (to include courier services such as Federal Express), ordinary business software (e.g., word
processing, spreadsheets, graphics, etc.), and normal copying and reproduction costs.

c.  Proposed labor rates shall be entered in the enclosed Labor Rate Table.  The Labor Rate Table represents fully-loaded hourly rates for each
skill classification. The fully-burdened labor rates shall include all direct, indirect, general and administrative costs and profit associated
with providing the required skill.  The fully-burdened labor rates shall include all labor and labor-related costs, such as, but not limited to,
the following list of representative labor-related costs:  salaries, wages, bonuses to include stock bonuses, incentive awards, employee stock
options, stock appreciation rights, employee stock ownership plans, employee insurance, fringe benefits, contributions to pension, other post-
retirement benefits, annuity, employee incentive compensation plans, incentive pay, shift differentials, overtime, vacation time, sick pay,
holidays, and all other allowances based upon a comprehensive employee compensation plan.  Contractor site rates shall also include contractor-
provided facilities, furniture, equipment, supplies, tool kits, employee training and overhead amounts required for work at contractor site
rates.  This includes, but is not limited to, telephones, fax machines and their telecommunications lines, copiers, personal computers, postage
(to include courier services such as Federal Express), ordinary business software, such as word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, and normal
copying and reproduction costs.  The use of uncompensated overtime is not allowed.

d.  Labor rates are fixed for the base period and option year periods, however, the contractor may submit a proposal reducing the fixed labor
rates and mark-up percentages at any time during the life of this contract.  The Government will review these proposals and determine if the
revised rates are realistic and in the best interest of the Government.

e.  The rates that are specified in the Labor Rate Table will apply to LH task orders issued within the scope of the work to be performed under
the contract.

f.  At the request of either the contractor or the Government, the contractor may throughout the life of the contract propose additional labor
categories, rates and descriptions in addition to the established labor categories, rates and descriptions that the contractor believes will be
required to support requirements of this contract.  These additional categories, rates and descriptions will be negotiated on a case-by-case
basis.  The additional categories, rates and descriptions proposed, upon determination by the Government that they are necessary for the scope
of the effort, and the prices are considered fair and reasonable, will be incorporated into the Labor Rate Table.

g.  For the purposes of the IDIQ evaluation, added or different labor categories may be proposed. The task order proposal may contain additional
categories at the Offeror’s discretion. The Offeror assumes appropriate risk / reward for additional labor categories as it applies to the
Government’s evaluation. If an Offeror with additional labor categories is awarded, those categories and rates will be added to the IDIQ
contract. As such, the Offeror will include option period rates for those additional labor categories.

3.0  LABOR RATE TABLE

The following Labor Rate Table represents fully-loaded hourly labor rates for each skill classification. The Offeror shall provide one composite
rate for worked performed at the Contractor site and one composite rate for worked performed at the Government site for each labor category. The
table reflects all of the Government required labor categories for evaluation purposes

1.3.5  Task Area 5 - Standards

JFAST is part of the JDDA-E.  The JDDA-E consists of Conceptual, Prescriptive, and Transition Architectures, referred to collectively as the
Enterprise Architecture (EA). The JDDA-E embodies the Distribution Process Owner’s (USTRANSCOM) Corporate Services Vision (CSV) and Service-
Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts.  Current governance, policy, architecture, standards, and specification documentation can be obtained by
coordinating with the JFAST PMO, who, in turn, will contact USTRANSCOM J6-A.  Other standards and specifications that are a part of the JDDA-E
Prescriptive Architecture are being defined and will be made available after they are delivered.  In the mean time, the contractor shall follow
existing federal, DOD, and USTRANSCOM guidelines.  The JFAST contractor shall abide by the requirements of the Department of Defense (DOD)
Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR) and the DOD Net-Centric environment as reflected in the JDDA-E.  The contractor shall show
traceability to the DTS Enterprise Architecture (EA) content to include identifying anticipated standards, new Information Exchange Requirements
(IER), and system interfaces.  This traceability shall be reflected in DODAF products for which the contractor shall be responsible to develop
or update.

DOD is implementing a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment to enhance net-centricity and data sharing within the Global Information
Grid (GIG).  As USTRANSCOM is in SOA discovery mode, the contractor shall consider SOA standards and protocols documented in the DISR and the
Net-Centric Operations Warfare Reference Model (NCOW RM) during system development and enhancement.  A SOA is a design style for building
flexible, adaptable distributed-computing environments for the DOD.  Service-oriented design is fundamentally about sharing and reusing
functionality across diverse applications.  Service-oriented design focuses on the following best practices: Make application and system
functionality as accessible and reusable services, Expose service functionality through programmatic interfaces, Maintain an abstraction layer
between service interfaces and service implementations, Describe service interfaces using standard metadata, Advertise and discover services
using standard service registries, and Communicate with services using standard protocols.

USTRANSCOM's Data Management Strategy is documented in the Information Reference Model Manual which is the governing document for Enterprise
Information Management within the Command.  This document outlines program responsibility in support of the strategy.  It mandates the creation
and use of Standard Message Templates and Standard Reference Data (USTRANSCOM Reference Data Management - TRDM).  The Enterprise Data Office
(TC/J6-AD) will assist with the creation of the Standard Message Templates once validated through the Enterprise Requirements Management
process.  The JFAST Contractor shall ensure JFAST data is submitted and compliant with USTRANSCOM’s Distribution Process Interface Exchange Data
Model (DPIEDM), and that no data business rule from that model is violated in the system, to include the database and interfaces.

which stores, manipulates, transmits, or receives data, the contractor shall include any new data elements in the system Logical Data Model
(LDM), to include a complete representation of the data elements that comprise that data.  The complete representation must contain, at a
minimum, the data element name, its definition, relationship with other data elements, its data type, data length and a list of enumerated
values, if applicable.  The complete representation must also employ a published specification language such as IDEF1X or UML.  To support this
task area, the contractor may be required to submit a complete description of the selected specification language and a completed data model to
the Government for approval.  The contractor shall coordinate with the PMO to consult with TCJ6-PE and/or TCJ6-AD for advice and review the
USTRANSCOM Prescriptive Information Reference Model Manual of the JDDA-E for additional guidance on database design/development and Standard

Deliverable: Process Improvement Recommendations

1.3.11  Task Area 11 - Enhancements.  The contractor shall provide FY 2010 enhancements as follows:

1.3.11.1  Develop Web-Based Capability – Phase I (optional).  Develop a web-based capability to access and update a previously saved JFAST plan.
 Updates will initially include the airlift & sealift fleets as well as port capabilities.  Need user updates from a web-based screen input.
Design will not require user updating JFAST to be logged into the JFAST application.  With proper authentication, the user will be able to
access a JFAST plan and make updates to the air and sea fleets and port capabilities.  This task would allow JFAST to react quickly to real-
world time-sensitive operations, and to operate with the most current data possible, thus increasing accuracy of modeling and scheduling within
JFAST.

1.3.11.2  Expand Sealift Late Analysis Categories.  Expand sealift late analysis categories (Sea):
Align late analysis graphs with sealift cargo categories.  Align with higher visibility cargo categories.  Expand the profiler late analysis
graphs to eight categories:  Break-bulk (MSC cargo class 10), Break-bulk Ammo (MSC cargo class A0), Container (MSC cargo classes 50, 5V, and
5R), Container Ammo (MSC cargo class 5A), Vehicles (MSC cargo class 30), Non-self deploying aircraft (MSC cargo class 2N), Floating Craft (MSC
cargo classes 2F and 3F) and POL (MSC Cargo class 80).  This will result in the elimination of the PAX late analysis graphic from the profiler.

1.3.11.3  Add Aircrews as Scheduling Constraint.  Track aircrews and constrain by augmented and basic aircrews.  Allow the user to define stage
location GEO code and regions to which crews would be allowed to fly.

1.3.11.4  Modify DESS for Compatibility with Integrated Global Transportation Network Exercise System.  Update JDLM and JFAST to allow interface
with the Integrated Global Transportation Network (GTN) Exercise System (IES).  JDLM and JFAST must be able to feed the same level of
information and data at the current level which is fed to the GTN Exercise System (GES).  This development must take advantage of the new
technologies being utilized under the IGC capability.

1.3.11.5  Airlift Shortfall Remark Not Matching Shortfall Condition.  Make remarks match the condition which drive an actual transportation
shortfall.  Below are three specific examples of the problem:
1) Airlift remarks state:  "Need en route to make STN--SK024".  This does not capture the true transportation issue.  This 'remark' was received
when the APOD was placed in an exclusion area.  With the APOD in an exclusion area, JFAST shortfalled all cargo/pax movement to the APOD.  This
'remark' should indicate "No Route" or other similar statement.
2) Airlift remarks state:  "No CGO/PAX A/C qualified--SK021".  The actual transportation issue is the cargo is below minimum ACL.
3) Airlift remarks state: "##mil and #civ air--SK024".  The airlift issue is there were no C5/C17 unloading permissions at the APOD.  Cargo was
shortfalled to the APOD as there were  no aircraft to carry it.  Airlift remark is misleading.

1.3.11.6  Update and Expand Checklist to Include All Modes.  Expand checklist to include standard steps to follow (All) – Make the tool more
user friendly for infrequent users – SDDC key exposes partially complete checklist that aids novice or infrequent user in setting up and using
origin model, which needs expanding to include airlift and sealift model and post-model run analysis steps.

1.3.11.7  Model ILOCS With Mode Changes.  Expand consideration of the effect of planned stops at intermediate locations (ILOC) so that the model
will honor an ILOC between an origin and Port of Embarkation (POE), between a POE and Port of Debarkation (POD), and between a POD and
destination to include the possibility of a transportation mode change at the ILOC.

1.3.11.8  Expanded Force Module Schedule Summary.  Users are often asked to determine how many ships and aircraft it takes to move specific
units.  The units are usually identified as a force module.  The Reports List interface includes a report named Force Module Schedule Summary
that shows aircraft and ship types used in the schedule.  However, the actual aircraft tail number and ship NISC and name are omitted.  Add two
new reports that show the ships and aircraft actually used in the schedule to deliver the force module.

1.3.11.9  Model Permissions by Berth.  Add permissions (ship types, operators, etc.) by berth capability.

1.3.11.10  Payload Delivery Time Incorrectly Reported as Aircraft Arrival Time – It Should Account for Offload.  The delivery time of the cargo
is now being reported as the ETA of the aircraft at the offload event.  This is too optimistic.  It takes some time to discharge the payload
from the aircraft before it can be classified as truly delivered.  As the original symptom description indicates, the delivery time should be
reported as the ETD of the aircraft from the airport at which the offload event occurs.

1.3.11.11  TPFDD Editor Not Carrying TPFDD Record “Non-Baseline” Data.  Allow the build and import and import of a B8 data file, and allow JFAST
to import the field.

1.3.11.12  Dynamically Adjust Port Processing Capability.  Detect port operation enablers being deployed at run time and automatically adjust
the airport’s or seaport’s personnel and cargo processing capability accordingly.

1.3.11.13  Modify Force Module Closure Report.  The Reports List Force Module Closure Graphs Report includes an Excel option that displays some
of the data graphed.  Add the destinations(s) of the movement requirements assigned to the force module to the information in the Excel file
only.  This feature will be particularly helpful in situations where JFAST functionality is being used to support war games.  In many cases, a
force module will contain only one destination.  If a force module has multiple destinations, then list them all.   This will allow the user to
view them all and to pick the one he wants to report.

1.3.11.14  Some PAX RLN`s Incorrectly Show Shortfall in Ground Model Which Run Log Describes as an Accompanying Pax issue (But No Cargo in
Record).  Accompany flag in TpDetail is incorrectly set to .T. for the pax portion of split shipments.  Set the accompany flag to .T. for req.

1.3.11.15  Add Multi Set of FIC to 0 and TUCHA Bump.  JFAST users at the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) often use JFAST for TPFDD development
and editing for future force structure studies.  As available TUCHA data will normally contain only current or historical force structure data,
users are often working with TPFDD data that was created as non-standard units.  CAA has recently developed the capability to create future
force structure TUCHA data.  The users now want those non-standard RLNS to become standard which  will reflect the force structure data in the
selected TUCHA.  This may currently be accomplished by (one RLN at a time) using the UTC editor interface to reset the FIC to zero for the
assigned UTC.  Add the capability to apply this "TUCHA refresh" edit as a mass edit capability against an entire collection of records or marked
records.  There is no need to change the UTC assigned, but only  to reset the FIC to 0 while at the same time pull the standard passenger and
cargo detail from the selected TUCHA reference data.

1.3.11.16  Add Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Modeling Capability.  Fusion Center requires capability to model force flow, FMS, and sustainment
flow during execution planning.  Specifically, planners require analysis of movement requirements from origin to final destination with user
identified waypoints throughout the transportation pipeline.

1.3.11.17  Import Ground Assets from IRRIS.  Establish an interface with IRRIS for the purpose of user controlled transfer to JFAST select CONUS
ground transportation data critical to accurate operational planning and transportation modeling.  Interface should allow a “snapshot in time”
transfer and translation of assets availability data and other available related information that may affect the modeling of CONUS ground
transportation in JFAST.

                                                             NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
                                                 FOR CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES ON USTRANSCOM CONTRACTS


NOTE:  This Non-Disclosure Agreement is a standard agreement designed for use by contractor (including subcontractor) employees assigned to work
on USTRANSCOM contracts.  Its use is designed to protect non-public Government information from disclosure and prevent violations of federal
statutes/regulations.  The restrictions contained in this agreement also serve contractors by promoting compliant behavior that keeps
contractors eligible to compete for Government contracts.  In addition to the potential impact on future business opportunities, failure to
abide by this agreement could result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties specified by statute or regulation.

1.  I,       currently an employee of   , hereby agree to the terms and conditions set forth below:

2.  I understand that I will have access to confidential business information (as defined by 18 USC 1905), contractor bid or proposal
information (as defined by FAR 3.104-3), and/or source selection sensitive information (as defined by FAR 3.104-3) either for contract
performance or as a result of working in a USTRANSCOM facility or of working near USTRANSCOM personnel, contractors, visitors, etc.  I fully
understand that such information is sensitive and must be protected in accordance with 41 U.S. Code Section 423 and 18 U.S. Code Section 1905
and FAR Part 3.  I also certify that I do not have any real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to the information disclosed.  If any
potential conflicts of interest, real or otherwise, do present themselves, then I shall immediately disclose the pertinent information that may
be a potential conflict to an agency ethics official who shall review the circumstances.

3.  In the course of performing under contract/order #    or some other contract or subcontract for the USTRANSCOM, I agree to:

      a)  Use only for Government purpose any and all confidential business information, contractor bid or proposal information, and/or source
selection sensitive information to which I am given access.  I agree not to disclose “non-public information” by any means (in whole or in part,
alone or in combination with other information, directly or indirectly or derivatively) to any person except to a U.S. Government official with
a need to know or to a non-Government person (including, but not limited to, a person in my company, affiliated companies, subcontractors, etc.)
who has a need to know related to the immediate contract/order, has executed a valid form of this non-disclosure agreement, and receives prior
clearance by the contracting officer.  All distribution of the documents will be controlled with the concurrence of the contracting officer.

      b)  “Non-public information,” as used herein, includes trade secrets, confidential or proprietary business information (as defined for
Government employees in 18 USC 1905); advance procurement information (future requirements, acquisition strategies, statements of work,
budget/program/planning data, etc.); source selection information (proposal rankings, source selection plans, contractor bid or proposal
information); information protected by the Privacy Act (social security numbers, home addresses, etc.); sensitive information protected from
release under the Freedom of Information Act (pre-decisional deliberations, litigation materials, privileged material, etc.); and information
that has not been released to the general public and has not been authorized for such release (as defined for Government employees in 5 CFR
2635.703).

      c)  Not to use such information for any non-governmental purposes, including, but not limited to, the preparation of bids or proposals, or
the development or execution of other business or commercial ventures.

      d)  To store the information in such a manner as to prevent inadvertent disclosure or releases to individuals who have not been authorized
access to it.

4.  I understand that I must never make an unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential business information, contractor bid or proposal
information, and/or source selection sensitive information unless:

      a)  The information has otherwise been made available without restriction to the Government, to a competing contractor, or to the public;

      b)  The Contracting Officer determines that such information is not subject to protection from release.

5.  I agree that I shall not seek access to “non-public information” beyond what is required for the performance of the services I am contracted
to perform.  I agree that when I seek access to such information or attend meetings or communicate with other parties about such information, I
will identify myself as a contractor.  Should I become aware of any improper or unintentional release or disclosure of “non-public information,”
I will immediately report it to the contracting officer in writing.  I agree that I will return all forms (including copies or reproduction of
original documents) of any “non-public information” provided to me by the Government for use in performing my duties to the control of the
Government when my duties no longer require this information.

By signing below, I certify that I have read and understand the terms of this Non-Disclosure Agreement and voluntarily agree to be bound by its
terms.

Performance Work Statement Joint Flow and Analysis System for Transportation (JFAST) 22 June 2009

1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES 1.1 Background. JFAST is a multi-modal transportation analysis model designed for USTRANSCOM and the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC). JFAST forecasts transportation requirements, performs course of action analysis, evaluates what-if scenarios, and builds delivery profiles of troops and equipment. JFAST assesses the transportation feasibility of contingency, crisis action, and exercise plans. JFAST is a Windows-based transportation-planning tool that provides an end-to-end transportation analysis capability to model the movement of forces from origin to the tactical assembly area. JFAST routes trucks, trains, buses, convoys, aircraft, and ships over selected lines of communication to identify transportation network bottlenecks, to determine lift requirements, and to project force closures. JFAST also simultaneously analyzes multiple plans to optimize the use of Defense Transportation System (DTS) resources. USTRANSCOM funds the development and support of the JFAST software application. The JPEC, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, and USTRANSCOM TCCs are primary JFAST users. 1.2 Scope. United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) requires continued development and support of its JFAST software application to comply with the Joint Chiefs of Staff planning doctrine, to implement USTRANSCOM and Transportation Component Command (TCC) enhancement requests, and to prototype new algorithms to improve the veracity of transportation planning. The contractor shall plan for all general tasks identified in this PWS required to maintain, support, and enhance JFAST. The contractor shall coordinate with the JFAST Program Manager (PM) to ensure that all activities are well synchronized and integrated with other USTRANSCOM modeling and simulation (M&S) efforts, and that replicated or overlapping efforts do not occur. 1.3 General Tasks. Each individual TO shall exist within the scope of the following task areas: Contract Management, Event and Exercise Support, Requirements Definition, Design and Development, Standards, Maintenance, System Administration, Information Assurance, Contingency Operations, Configuration Management and Enhancements (specific tasks specified and performed under individual TOs). 1.3.1 Task Area 1 ­ Contract Management. This task area shall encompass overall contract management to include administrative, clerical, documentation, and related functions. The contractor shall designate an individual from the contractor`s resources to be the focal point for all contract management communications with USTRANSCOM, and to be responsible for ensuring successful accomplishment of PWS tasks. Point of contact (POC) information, to include name, title, phone number, and email address, are to be provided to the Contracting Officer at the Post-Award Conference. In support of this task, the contractor may be requested to provide documents such as Task Order Management Plans (TOMP), Monthly Status Reports (MSR), In-Process Reviews (IPR), Integrated Management Schedules (IMS), Contract Summary Reports (CSR), and Variance Reports. The contractor may also be requested to provide demonstration and teleconference support. 1.3.2 Task Area 2 - Event and Exercise Support. Using off-site resources, the contractor shall provide technical support to USTRANSCOM for real-world events and Command Post Exercises (CPXs). Software development support for exercises may be required for approximately 50 days during the period of performance. This includes

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 21 of 79 software troubleshooting and development in support of joint exercises. In addition, the contractor shall update the following DESS documentation to incorporate Spiral 7 requirements: Functional Documentation, System Documentation, Technical Documentation, DESS Architecture, External Interface Identification, External Software Item Interface Definition, JFAST Operator`s manual for simulation version, and JFAST - SUSGEN User`s Setup Guide. Note, the contractor-developed system shall be capable of operation at the SECRET level and compatible for operations across the SIPRNET. 1.3.3 Task Area 3 - Requirements Definition. The Functional Manager will provide a prioritized list of functional requirements to the PM, who then will provide these requirements to the contractor. The contractor shall coordinate and integrate the technical expertise required to construct the system and associated databases (if applicable), and support field testing in a limited operational environment. 1.3.4 Task Area 4 - Design and Development. The contractor shall design, develop, and test new system capabilities using commercial best practices appropriate to the JFAST functional requirements. For System Development, the contractor shall:

1.3.5 Task Area 5 ­ Standards. JFAST is part of the JDDA-E. The JDDA-E consists of Conceptual, Prescriptive, and Transition Architectures, referred to collectively as the Enterprise Architecture (EA). The JDDA-E embodies the Distribution Process Owner`s (USTRANSCOM) Corporate Services Vision (CSV) and Service -Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts. Current governance, policy, architecture, standards, and specification documentation can be obtained by coordinating with the JFAST PMO, who, in turn, will contact USTRANSCOM J6-A. Other standards and specifications that are a part of the JDDA-E Prescriptive Architecture are being defined and will be made available after they are delivered. In the mean time, the contractor shall follow existing federal, DOD, and USTRANSCOM guidelines. The JFAST contractor shall abide by the requirements of the Department of Defense (DOD) Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR) and the DOD Net-Centric environment as reflected in

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 22 of 79 the JDDA-E. The contractor shall show traceability to the DTS Enterprise Architecture (EA) content to include identifying anticipated standards, new Information Exchange Requirements (IER), and system interfaces. This traceability shall be reflected in DODAF products for which the contractor shall be responsible to develop or update. DOD is implementing a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment to enhance net-centricity and data sharing within the Global Information Grid (GIG). As USTRANSCOM is in SOA discovery mode, the contractor shall consider SOA standards and protocols documented in the DISR and the Net-Centric Operations Warfare Reference Model (NCOW RM) during system development and enhancement. A SOA is a design style for building flexible, adaptable distributed-computing environments for the DOD. Service-oriented design is fundamentally about sharing and reusing functionality across diverse applications. Service-oriented design focuses on the following best practices: Make application and system functionality as accessible and reusable services, Expose service functionality through programmatic interfaces, Maintain an abstraction layer between service interfaces and service implementations, Describe service interfaces using standard metadata, Advertise and discover services using standard service registries, and Communicate with services using standard protocols. USTRANSCOM's Data Management Strategy is documented in the Information Reference Model Manual which is the governing document for Enterprise Information Management within the Command. This document outlines program responsibility in support of the strategy. It mandates the creation and use of Standard Message Templates and Standard Reference Data (USTRANSCOM Reference Data Management - TRDM). The Enterprise Data Office (TC/J6-AD) will assist with the creation of the Standard Message Templates once validated through the Enterprise Requirements Management process. The JFAST Contractor shall ensure JFAST data is submitted and compliant with USTRANSCOM`s Distribution Process Interface Exchange Data Model (DPIEDM), and that no data business rule from that model is violated in the system, to include the database and interfaces. 1.3.6 Task Area 6 ­ Maintenance. The Contractor shall provide software, systems, and interface maintenance (e.g. CFAST) in support of JFAST. In addition, the contractor shall support the installation of required hardware, communication lines, security and system software at the USTRANSCOM site. 1.3.7 Task Area 7 - System Administration (SA).

APPENDIX D PROJECTED ENHANCEMENTS

The below enhancements are identified by fiscal year and may include an optional tasking. In addition, the enhancements are directly related to the contract period and will be exercised by issuance of a task order. Projected enhancements may include but are not limited to the following: FY10 1.3.11.1 Develop Web-Based Capability ­ Phase I (optional). Develop a web-based capability to access and update a previously saved JFAST plan. Updates will initially include the airlift & sealift fleets as well as port capabilities. Need user updates from a web-based screen input. Design will not require user updating JFAST to be logged into the JFAST application. With proper authentication, the user will be able to access a JFAST plan and make updates to the air and sea fleets and port capabilities. This task would allow JFAST to react quickly to realworld time-sensitive operations, and to operate with the most current data possible, thus increasing accuracy of modeling and scheduling within JFAST. 1.3.11.2 Expand Sealift Late Analysis Categories. Expand sealift late analysis categories (Sea): Align late analysis graphs with sealift cargo categories. Align with higher visibility cargo categories. Expand the profiler late analysis graphs to eight categories: Break-bulk (MSC cargo class 10), Break-bulk Ammo (MSC cargo class A0), Container (MSC cargo classes 50, 5V, and 5R), Container Ammo (MSC cargo class 5A), Vehicles (MSC cargo class 30), Non-self deploying aircraft (MSC cargo class 2N), Floating Craft (MSC cargo classes 2F and 3F) and POL (MSC Cargo class 80). This will result in the elimination of the PAX late analysis graphic from the profiler. 1.3.11.3 Add Aircrews as Scheduling Constraint. Track aircrews and constrain by augmented and basic aircrews. Allow the user to define stage location GEO code and regions to which crews would be allowed to fly. 1.3.11.4 Modify DESS for Compatibility with Integrated Global Transportation Network Exercise System. Update JDLM and JFAST to allow interface with the Integrated Global Transportation Network (GTN) Exercise System (IES). JDLM and JFAST must be able to feed the same level of information and data at the current level which is fed to the GTN Exercise System (GES). This development must take advantage of the new technologies being utilized under the IGC capability. 1.3.11.5 Airlift Shortfall Remark Not Matching Shortfall Condition. Make remarks match the condition which drive an actual transportation shortfall. Below are three specific examples of the problem: 1) Airlift remarks state: "Need en route to make STN--SK024". This does not capture the true transportation issue. This 'remark' was received when the APOD was placed in an exclusion area. With the APOD in an exclusion area, JFAST shortfalled all cargo/pax movement to the APOD. This 'remark' should indicate "No Route" or other similar statement. 2) Airlift remarks state: "No CGO/PAX A/C qualified--SK021". The actual transportation issue is the cargo is below minimum ACL. 3) Airlift remarks state: "##mil and #civ air--SK024". The airlift issue is there were no C5/C17 unloading permissions at the APOD. Cargo was shortfalled to the APOD as there were no aircraft to carry it. Airlift remark is misleading. 1.3.11.6 Update and Expand Checklist to Include All Modes. Expand checklist to include standard steps to follow (All) ­ Make the tool more user friendly for infrequent users ­ SDDC key exposes partially complete checklist that aids novice or infrequent user in setting up and using origin model, which needs expanding to include airlift and sealift model and post-model run analysis steps.

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 38 of 79 1.3.11.7 Model ILOCS With Mode Changes. Expand consideration of the effect of planned stops at intermediate locations (ILOC) so that the model will honor an ILOC between an origin and Port of Embarkation (POE), between a POE and Port of Debarkation (POD), and between a POD and destination to include the possibility of a transportation mode change at the ILOC. 1.3.11.8 Expanded Force Module Schedule Summary. Users are often asked to determine how many ships and aircraft it takes to move specific units. The units are usually identified as a force module. The Reports List interface includes a report named Force Module Schedule Summary that shows aircraft and ship types used in the schedule. However, the actual aircraft tail number and ship NISC and name are omitted. Add two new reports that show the ships and aircraft actually used in the schedule to deliver the force module. 1.3.11.9 Model Permissions by Berth. Add permissions (ship types, operators, etc.) by berth capability. 1.3.11.10 Payload Delivery Time Incorrectly Reported as Aircraft Arrival Time ­ It Should Account for Offload. The delivery time of the cargo is now being reported as the ETA of the aircraft at the offload event. This is too optimistic. It takes some time to discharge the payload from the aircraft before it can be classified as truly delivered. As the original symptom description indicates, the delivery time should be reported as the ETD of the aircraft from the airport at which the offload event occurs. 1.3.11.11 TPFDD Editor Not Carrying TPFDD Rec ord "Non-Baseline" Data. Allow the build and import and import of a B8 data file, and allow JFAST to import the field. 1.3.11.12 Dynamically Adjust Port Processing Capability. Detect port operation enablers being deployed at run time and automatically adjust the airport`s or seaport`s personnel and cargo processing capability accordingly. 1.3.11.13 Modify Force Module Closure Report. The Reports List Force Module Closure Graphs Report includes an Excel option that displays some of the data graphed. Add the destinations(s) of the movement requirements assigned to the force module to the information in the Excel file only. This feature will be particularly helpful in situations where JFAST functionality is being used to support war games. In many cases, a force module will contain only one destination. If a force module has multiple destinations, then list them all. This will allow the user to view them all and to pick the one he wants to report. 1.3.11.14 Some PAX RLN`s Incorrectly Show Shortfall in Ground Model Which Run Log Describes as an Accompanying Pax issue (But No Cargo in Record). Accompany flag in TpDetail is incorrectly set to .T. for the pax portion of split shipments. Set the accompany flag to .T. for req. 1.3.11.15 Add Multi Set of FIC to 0 and TUCHA Bump. JFAST users at the Center for Army Analysis (CAA) often use JFAST for TPFDD development and editing for future force structure studies. As available TUCHA data will normally contain only current or historical force structure data, users are often working with TPFDD data that was created as non-standard units. CAA has recently developed the capability to create future force structure TUCHA data. The users now want those non-standard RLNS to become standard which will reflect the force structure data in the selected TUCHA. This may currently be accomplished by (one RLN at a time) using the UTC editor interface to reset the FIC to zero for the assigned UTC. Add the capability to apply this "TUCHA refresh" edit as a mass edit capability against an entire collection of records or marked records. There is no need to change the UTC assigned, but only to reset the FIC to 0 while at the same time pull the standard passenger and cargo detail from the selected TUCHA reference data. 1.3.11.16 Add Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Modeling Capability. Fusion Center requires capability to model force flow, FMS, and sustainment flow during execution planning. Specifically, planners require analysis of movement requirements from origin to final destination with user identified waypoints throughout the transportation pipeline. 1.3.11.17 Import Ground Assets from IRRIS. Establish an interface with IRRIS for the purpose of user controlled transfer to JFAST select CONUS ground transportation data critical to accurate operational planning and

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 39 of 79 transportation modeling. Interface should allow a snapshot in time transfer and translation of assets availability data and other available related information that may affect the modeling of CONUS ground transportation in JFAST.

FY11 1.3.11.18 Develop Web Based Capability Phase II (optional). Develop a web-based capability to access and update a previously saved JFAST plan. Updates will initially include the airlift & sealift fleets as well as port capabilities. Need user updates from a web-based screen input. Design will not require user updating JFAST to be logged into the JFAST application. With proper authentication, the user will be able to access a JFAST plan and make updates to the air and sea fleets and port capabilities. This task would allow JFAST to react quickly to realworld time-sensitive operations, and to operate with the most current data possible, thus increasing accuracy of modeling and scheduling within JFAST. 1.3.11.19 Create and Maintain a Library of the Current Real-World Ship Manifests for the Prepositioned Ships in DESS Exercises. Create and maintain a library of the current real-world ship manifests for the prepositioned ships in the WPS manifest format and detail to allow rapid entry into the exercise in-transit visibility systems. 1.3.11.20 Add JFAST Model Setup Wizard. This requirement runs the gamut from resetting to a default set of run options to a "Turbo Tax Ž" like wizard which sets up run options according to user responses to questions. 1.3.11.21 JFAST Validation Tool. Add a set of validation rules that could be run always, only when loading a plan, or only upon manual launch that look over all user setup data and evaluate it for reasonableness. For example, does the C-17s max fuel, min fuel, alternate fuel, burn rates, and payload make sense, etc. 1.3.11.22 SUSGEN opens in back ground when other software applications are open. When multiple applications are open, SUSGEN will open in the background of other applications. Stop SUSGEN from opening in these scenarios. 1.3.11.23 Ensure JFAST Provides Up-to-Date Airlift Transportation Cost. Revise how the airlift model processes airlift cost rate per hour. Currently, aircraft cost-per-hour is included as part of each aircraft`s characteristics. As an aircraft is entered into a JFAST plan, aircraft attributes are set. As the plan ages, aircraft cost per hour within the plan does not update. Additionally, the JFAST system user has no way of knowing that aircraft cost data may not be accurate. To update the cost data, aircraft would need to be re-inserted into the plan. Reinserting aircraft into the plan updates aircraft attributes which includes bringing up to date aircraft cost. Aircraft cost per hour is update yearly based on USTRANSCOM J8 provided data. Aircraft Cost Factors Report ­ Estimated cost of airlift transportation listing all aircraft types (denoting primary use as CGO or PAX), total flying ours, cost rate per hour and total cost for Pax and Cargo.

FY12 1.3.11.24 Honor JOPES Scheduling Priority. Modify the JFAST scheduling algorithm to honor a combatant commander assigned priority for each POD and LAD, when provided. The Joint Operations Planning and Execution (JOPES) database includes optional data fields in which a priority may be assigned to each unit line number formatted force movement requirements. These fields are the named the "Port of Debarkation Priority of Arrival" (PODPRI) and the "Port of Debarkation Priority Add On" (PODADD). The PODPRI value is a three-digit number (000-999). It indicates the desired sequence of arrival at the POD. The number indicates the sequence of arrival within an LAD. Priority order is depicted with a unique number for each LAD when order of arrival of forces at the POD is essential for operations. The same priority number may be used for a single LAD, a single POD, or repeated for more than one requirement for each LAD/POD when arrival order is not strictly prescribed. The PODADD is a single alpha character value excluding "I" and "O". It provides a means of inserting a force requirement into the

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 40 of 79 POD priority for arrival without re-sequencing the already assigned priorities. Combined, the PODPRI and PODADD values may determine the combatant commander's required order for forces to arrive at each POD on each LAD. 1.3.11.25 Volumetric Loading of Aircraft. Complete work on constraining aircraft loading by taking into account cargo compartment sq ft and pallet capacity. Use cargo hold and cargo dimensions (computed volumes) to more accurately assess a concept aircraft`s ability to efficiently transport Outsize/Oversize/Bulk cargoes. Use actual number and capacity of pallets in computing concept aircraft capability. 1.3.11.26 Simplify Manual Air Route Network. Modify the logic so the manual air network router captures all the from/to pairs in the requirements and builds routes between the possible from/to pairs. Add logic to help identify which from /to pairs require enroute airfields. 1.3.11.27 Forecasting Transportation Feasibility During Execution. Model planned vs. actual with multiple processors and collaborative planning. Allow automatic rewind of the schedule to reschedule around fixed events taking into account new data. This is essentially a rolling forecast. 1.3.11.28 Enhance JFAST Messaging to Show All Errors, Not Just Last. JFAST messaging currently only shows the last error that caused a requirement not to move. Modify the messaging system to make it more complete and simpler. Create a message table which would hold all possible error messages. As the scheduler runs, it would write the error ID to the runlog for all constraints that don't work. For example, if more than one aircraft are tried and fail for one reason or another, all the various reasons would be captured, not just the last. 1.3.11.29 Extend Marshalling and Staging to Air. Add ability to constrain airlift with staging and marshalling capacities at POE and POD similar to Sea. 1.3.11.30 Add Ground Mode Requirements to Profiler. Enhance Profiler by adding Ground Mode Requirements. Adds capability for graphing and presentation of requirements and lateness for origin to POE or POE to POD ground movements. 1.3.11.31 Oversize/Outsize Cargo Definition. Add the capability to define or override hardwired definition of Outsize and Oversize Cargo. Allow either certain "defined outsize" cargo to load on concept aircraft while restricting load from C-5/C-17 or "defined oversize" to not load on C-130. 1.3.11.32 Display Dates as Calendar or Relative Dates. All dates in JFAST are currently expressed in relative dates with positive values representing days following the first day of the deployment timeline (C-day) and negative values for dates preceding the first day of deployment. This is appropriate in a plan for which C-day is undefined/unknown. When JFAST is used to analyze time-phased force and deployment date for which the C-day is known, the user selectable option to display dates in either relative dates or Gregorian calendar-based dates is required. Create/modify this option so as it can be applicable to all reports, graphs and user interfaces in JFAST. 1.3.11.33 Create the ability to lock down a file in JFAST to provide a read-only look at post conference Force Flow data. Create the ability to lock down a file in JFAST to provide a read only look at post conference Force Flow data. Purpose is to provide a "PID of Record" like capability in JFAST where planners can retrieve the data from a secure folder and open in the JFAST environment to and look at the actual conference data, but not have the ability to change it. There may be many ways to accomplish this. One would be to provide access to a read-only library that the lead and/or the USTRANSCOM planner can publish the final conference data to. Possibilities also are that the read-only library would be by plan or by plan series, so all XXXXXX series plan appear in that library. Similar to 16932, but JFAST stand alone specific. 1.3.11.34 Load Ship Based on ALD. Create options in the Sea Setup user interface to select 'Load ship based on ALD' or 'Load ship based on LAD (default)'. The intent of this feature is to change the relative importance of latest arrival date (LAD) at the port of debarkation and the available to load date (ALD) at the port of embarkation in

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 41 of 79 prioritizing strategic sealift requirements. Sometimes ALD is more of a driving factor in ship selection and assignment to requirements than LAD. 1.3.11.35 Develop Manual Ground Planner Routing. Develop manual routing planner for the ground scheduler. 1.3.11.36 Activate JCS Priority Code. Activate JCS Priority Code as a Scheduling Priority Indicator. The "TPFDD Loader PID and TUCHA Selection" screen is one of three screens presented the user during the load of a TPFDD B8 file. It contains a currently unused user definable field for assigning a JCS Priority code to each PID loaded into the JFAST TPFDD database. Activate this feature as a priority indicator for the schedulers to honor when movement requirements exceed capability within a standard scheduling day. In this way, the JCS priority code may be used by the planner to indicate the relative priority, by PID, for assignment of the scarce transportation assets and infrastructure capability when dates alone are inadequate. FY13 1.3.11.37 Adjust Profiler Requirements Window Date Range. Adjustable Profiler Requirements Window. The Profiler graphic is the JFAST signature output. It displays the requirement for sealift by LAD (or RDD for the Theater phase). Add a feature that will allow user selection of the date range over which the requirement displayed is averaged. For example, this feature might allow the user to define that the movement requirement is to be spread (averaged) over the LAD minus 2 to the LAD date range, or perhaps the lad minus 4 to the lad minus 1 date range. Similarly, for the theater phase, the requirement could be referenced to the RDD so that the user may define that the requirement be averaged over the RDD - 5 to the RDD - 0 date range. 1.3.11.38 Wargame Validation of JFAST Schedules. 1. Add event horizons to JFAST. Currently the model "sees" an event before it happens (i.e., close a port, reduce throughput, etc.). This works fine if the change is preplanned. Provide the ability to input an enemy action and see the impact on the deployment (e.g., close a port due to enemy attack) without the model seeing it but react to it when it happens. This drives more toward a simulation. 2. Automatically reroute air/ship. Tied to the event horizon above, if a port is closed, reroute the aircraft/ship to the next/nearest available port for offloading, using only those PODs already in the plan (try to simulate the human decision process, what port would be diverted to). 1.3.11.39 Sustainment Generator Not Saving Time Periods Tab. Allow the changes to the Time Periods Tab in SUSGEN to be saved. 1.3.11.40 Need a Berth Editor for Reference Data. Add the capability to edit berths at the reference data level (in admin module). 1.3.11.41 Create Ship Load at SPOE Lock. Provide the capability to pre-assign a ship to an SPOE so that the sealift scheduler will give priority to use that ship for manifesting requirements at that SPOE on the second and subsequent voyages of the ship. Additional proactive work on assigning FMIDs. Pre-assigning a ship to cargo is sometimes insufficient to guarantee the ship will load at the desired SPOE. Sometimes holding a ship against the JFAST sealift scheduler's desire to move it to a different SPOE, perhaps on the opposite coast, is required. The policy phase of the strategic sealift scheduler currently supports pre-assigning a force module ID to a ship which should result in the sealift scheduler giving priority to first manifesting the ship with the requirements in the force module before considering any other voyage assignments for the ship. Editor can say why cargo isn't a good match, etc. Possibly block the ship according to pre-assigning, but use it during the interim buffer time. 1.3.11.42 Segregate Exclusion Area Affects on Road Transportation from Rail Transportation. Modify implementation of exclusion areas such that effects on road and rail transportation are segregated. A recent exercise focused on the impacts of a natural disaster and providing disaster relief. Highway and rail were among the various infrastructures affected by the natural disaster. It was projected that only isolated sectors of the highway network were affected by the disaster therefore degraded highway transportation was still viable. However,

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 42 of 79 all rail transportation was suspended within the affected region pending inspection the rail infrastructure. Implementation of a scenario in JFAST that disables all rail transportation in the affected area while allowing degraded highway transportation is not feasible in JFAST using exclusion areas. As currently implemented, defining an exclusion area that disables rail travel also disables all highway travel. 1.3.11.43 Allow Addition of User Defined Locations to Transportation Scenarios. Implement a capability for the JFAST user to identify locations necessary to define transportation scenario routing details beyond the limitations of the locations defined in the JOPES geographic location reference data. Implementation should support both mapbased user selection of a location and data entry of a latitude and longitude to define the geographic position of each location. The location attributes should be scalable to support user definition of other characteristics that determine how the location may be used in the transportation scenario. With the exception of user defined air refueling points, locations currently employed in the JFAST transportation scenarios are limited to those defined in the geographic location reference data obtained from JOPES. As the JFAST enhancements continue to improve transportation modeling fidelity, it will become necessary for the user to identify itinerary locations for the transportation scenario in addition to those provided in the movement requirements. For example, as is the case with air refueling locations, theater ground transportation routing may require use of locations in the definition of the transportation routing scenario that are not defined as a JOPES geographic location. 1.3.11.44 Separate Airport Editor. Engineer the airport editor into a separate component. 1.3.11.45 Separate Seaport Editor. Engineer the seaport editor into a separate component. 1.3.11.46 Separate Origin Out-Loading Editor. Engineer the origin out-loading editor into a separate component (DPO). 1.3.11.47 Separate Reports Component. Engineer the reporting system into a separate component.

H-3. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 1. Organizational Conflicts of Interest (a) As required by FAR 9.5, the Government will ensure that no organizational and consultant conflicts of interest are present in this acquisition. The Government will accomplish this by following the guidance set forth in paragraphs b-e below. (b) As a part of the proposal, the offeror shall provide the Contracting Officer with complete information of previous or ongoing work for the Government, or for a contractor under contract with the Government, that is in any way associated with the contemplated acquisition. Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that: ___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or ___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, complete information of previous or ongoing work that is in any way associated with the contemplated acquisition and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 50 of 79 (c) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. The Contracting Officer may also determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award. (d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit, upon request or as part of its proposal, a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan. (e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to the Government to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict. 2. Organizational Conflicts of Interest (continued) (a) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest is identified during performance of this contract, the Contractor will immediately make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict of interest. (b) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision. (c) Remedies--USTC may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential organizational conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose it or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (d) Flow-down. The Contractor agrees to insert in each subcontract or consultant agreement placed hereunder, which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. 3. Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel Contract Clause (a) In addition to the requirements of the contract clause above entitled Organizational Conflicts of Interest, the following provisions with regard to employee personnel performing under this contract shall apply until the earlier of the following two dates: the termination date of the affected employee(s) or the expiration date of the contract. (b) The Contractor agrees to notify immediately the USTC Contracting Officer of (1) any actual or potential personal conflict of interest with regard to any of its employees working on or having access to information regarding this contract, or (2) any such conflicts concerning subcontractor employees or consultants working on or having access to information regarding this contract, when such conflicts have been reported to the Contractor. A personal conflict of interest is defined as a relationship of an employee, subcontractor employee, or consultant with an entity that may impair the objectivity of the employee, subcontractor employee, or consultant in performing the contract work.

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 51 of 79 (c) The Contractor agrees to notify the USTC Contracting Officer prior to incurring costs for that employee's work when an employee may have a personal conflict of interest. In the event that the personal conflict of interest does not become known until after performance on the contract begins, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer of the personal conflict of interest. The Contractor shall continue performance of this contract until notified by the Contracting Officer of the appropriate action to be taken. (d) The Contractor agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement placed hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (d), unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. 4. Limitation of Future Contracting Contract Clause Pursuant to FAR 9.507-1 and 9.507-2. (a) The parties to this contract agree that the Contractor will be restricted in its future contracting in the manner described below. Except as specifically provided in this clause, the Contractor shall be free to compete for contracts on an equal basis with other companies. (b) If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through the performance of work pursuant to this contract, is required to develop specifications or statements of work and such specifications or statements of work are incorporated into an USTC solicitation, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described in that solicitation as a prime Contractor or subcontractor under an ensuing USTC contract for a period of three years after the completion of the contract. (c) If the Contractor performs systems engineering and/or technical direction, but will not have overall contractual responsibility for the system's development, integration, assembly and checkout, or production, the Contractor is precluded for the life of the system from award of a USTC contract to supply the system or any of its major components, and from acting as a subcontractor or consultant to a USTC supplier for the system or any of its major components. (d) If the Contractor participates in the technical evaluation of other Contractors' proposals or products, to ensure objectivity, the Contractor is precluded from award of any supply or service contract or subcontract for the system or its major components. This restriction shall be effective for three years after the completion of the contract. This does not apply to other technical evaluations concerning the system. (e) The Contractor may gain access to proprietary information of other companies during contract performance. The Contractor agrees to enter into company-to-company agreements to (1) protect another company's information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it is considered proprietary by the other company and (2) to refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. For information purposes, the Contractor shall furnish copies of these agreements to the Contracting Officer. These agreements are not intended to protect information which is available to the Government or to the Contractor from other sources and furnished voluntarily without restriction. (f) The Contractor agrees to insert in each subcontract or consultant agreement placed hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may request in writing that the Contracting Officer exempt from this clause a particular subcontract or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services not specifically listed above, including laboratory analysis. The Contracting Officer will review and evaluate each request on a caseby-case basis before approving or disapproving the request.

PAYMENTS UNDER TIME AND MATERIALS AND LABOR HOUR CONTRACTS (FEB 2007)

The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative: (a) Hourly rate. (1) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are-(i) Performed by the Contractor; (ii) Performed by the subcontractors; or (iii) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control. (2) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of direct labor hours performed. (3) The hourly rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by employees that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (4) The hourly rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (5) Cost vouchers may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer), to the cognizant DCAA office, Contracting Officer and authorized Contracting Officer`s Representative (See section G). The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment and by: (i) Individual daily job timekeeping records; (ii) Records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; or (iii) Other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer.

(7) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a contract modification requiring the Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the amounts due under paragraph (a) of this clause, but the total amount withheld for the contract shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor executes and delivers the release required by paragraph (g) of this clause.

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 58 of 79 (8) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. (b) Materials. (1) For the purposes of this clause-(i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service. (ii) Materials means-(A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control; (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); and (D) Applicable indirect costs. (2) If the Contractor furnishes its own materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the-(i) Quantities being acquired; and (ii) Actual cost of any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (3) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for allowable cost of materials provided the Contractor-(i) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (ii) Ordinarily makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (4) Payment for materials is subject to the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract. The Contracting Officer will determine allowable costs of materials in accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this contract. (5) The Contractor may include allocable indirect costs and other direct costs to the extent they are-(i) Comprised only of costs that are clearly excluded from the hourly rate; (ii) Allocated in accordance with the Contractor's written or established accounting practices; and (iii) Indirect costs are not applied to subcontracts that are paid at the hourly rates. (6) To the extent able, the Contractor shall--

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 59 of 79 (i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (ii) Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the reasons. The Contractor shall give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the Contractor, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not deduct from gross costs the benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the Government. (7) Except as provided for in 31.205-26(e) and (f), the Government will not pay profit or fee to the prime Contractor on materials. (c) If the Contractor enters into any subcontract that requires consent under the clause at 52.244-2, Subcontracts, without obtaining such consent, the Government is not required to reimburse the Contractor for any costs incurred under the subcontract prior to the date the Contractor obtains the required consent. Any reimbursement of subcontract costs incurred prior to the date the consent was obtained shall be at the sole discretion of the Government. (d) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (e) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (f) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit of the vouchers and supporting documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the Contractor as the ``completion voucher'' and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents and the terms of paragraph (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion voucher, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 60 of 79 (g) Assignment and Release of Claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions: (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor. (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. (h) Interim payments on contracts for other than services. (1) Interim payments made prior to the final payment under the contract are contract financing payments. Contract financing payments are not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act. (2) The designated payment office will make interim payments for contract financing on the 30th day after the designated billing office receives a proper payment request. In the event that the Government requires an audit or other review of a specific payment request to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the specified due date. (i) Interim payments on contracts for services. For interim payments made prior to the final payment under this contract, the Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 72 of 79 limitations may be placed on responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs). The specified page limits for EN responses will be identified in the letters sent to the offerors. B. Specific Instructions 1. Volume I ­ Past Performance

Each offeror may submit up to three (3) past performance examples for same or similar type contracts performed for Federal agencies or commercial customers within the last three (3) years. These contracts should be similar in size, scope and complexity to the PWS requirements and should demonstrate the offeror's ability to perform the work identified in the Performance Areas identified below. Each individual example provided does not need to reflect performance in all of the areas. Information must be current (within the last 3 years). Undated information or information over three years old will not be considered. In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problem. a. Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor`s consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor. (Not included in page count limitation.) b. Quality and Satisfaction Rating. Provide any information currently available (letters, metrics, customer surveys, independent surveys, etc.) which demonstrates customer satisfaction with overall job performance and quality of services. Submitted information must be customer/user generated ­ not a document developed by the offeror. (No page limit.) c. Performance Questionnaires. The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror`s performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFP. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources, such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. The offeror shall send out the Past Performance Questionnaires (Attachment 1) to each of the offeror`s Points of Contact (POCs). The responsibility to send out the Past Performance Questionnaires rests solely with the offeror; whereas, it shall not be delegated to any other entity. The Transmittal Letter shall be used by the offeror in sending out the Past Performance Surveys. Once these Past Performance Questionnaires are completed by your POCs, the information therein shall be considered sensitive and shall not be released to you, the offeror. Surveys shall be sent directly back to the Government. If more than one survey is received on any of the three contract examples, only the first one received will be accepted. The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. (No page limit ­ One survey accepted per contract example). d. Relevancy Statements. For each of the three relevant contracts for which you send a Past Performance Questionnaire, provide with your proposal a relevancy statement which provides a clear explanation of the relevancy of each contract. The Government will not be bound by those statements in making its own relevancy determinations. Each example shall include the following header information: Point of Contact (w/ name, duty title/organization, phone#, email), contract name, contract number, performance period, CAGE code, and DUNS number. (Page limit is two (2) pages per statement; no more than six (6) pages total.) Performance Areas:   Experience with software development that supports strategic and theater deployment and sustainment of forces for multi-modal transportation feasibility models (includes the calculation of fuel requirements used by air and/or sea fleets). Experience with the development that supports forecasting of transportation requirements, course-ofaction analysis, crisis action planning and conducting what-if scenarios in support of end-to-end

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 73 of 79 distribution or mobility modeling. This also includes discrete event modeling (i.e., a specific event within an end-to-end or mobility process). Experience with development of transportation models that support the exercise of training objectives and simulation of data feeds to operational command and control systems.



e. Teaming Arrangements. If contemplated, provide complete information as to the arrangement, including any relevant and recent past/present performance information on previous teaming arrangements with same partner. If this is a first time joint effort, each party to the arrangement must provide a list of past and present relevant contracts. (Page limit is two (2) pages.) 2. Volume II ­ Task Order Approach Offerors shall submit a sound approach for accomplishing the requirements of the Task Order 0001 within the required period of performance (The optional task at 1.3.11.1 shall be included in the proposal). The plan shall adequately identify all major project activities in logical order and realistic milestone dates. Rationale for the proposed labor categories and hours mix of personnel shall be provided in a narrative. Additionally, offerors shall show their approach in a personnel matrix which identifies all labor categories to be used in performing Task Order 0001. The matrix shall correlate positions by labor category to the PWS paragraphs. The format for this matrix is as the offeror deems appropriate. The matrix is included in the page count. 3. Volume III - Contract Documentation and Cost & Price a. Complete Contact Information Sheet (Attachment 2). b. Complete blocks 15, 16 and 17 of the SF33. If applicable, include signed amendments to the RFP. In so doing, the offeror accedes to the contract terms and conditions as written in the RFP, with attachments. c. Pricing. (i) Complete the attached Contract Labor Rate Table (Attachment 3). Explanation of this IDIQ-level rate table is provided in the attachment. (ii) Complete the attached pricing table for Task Order 0001 (Attachment 4). The matrix shall list labor categories and fully-loaded hourly rates for the task order performance period. A total price shall be submitted for Task Order 0001, shown in the CLIN structure at Attachment 5. d. Complete the necessary fill-ins and certifications in Section K. e. Complete blocks 6 and 7 of the DD form 254, Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification, (Attachment 6). f. Complete the Source Selection Evaluation Matrix (Attachment 7). g. In accordance with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, all large business offerors shall submit a subcontracting plan. 4. Volume IV - Small Business Commitment a.

The statement shall not exceed five (5) pages and must address the following:

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 74 of 79 i. The dollar value and percentage of the total proposed subcontracted effort including the effort to LB, SB, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone firms, and HBCUs/MIs. Identify, in terms of dollar value AND percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor. If the subcontracting targets proposed are less than the USTRANSCOM subcontracting goals (See Attachment 8), the offeror shall provide supporting rationale. Successful offeror`s goals will be incorporated into the PWS at time of award. ii. The type of services to be subcontracted. b. For each contract referenced under Past Performance Volume I, all Offerors shall submit a copy of Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts (for example the SF294/Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) Individual Subcontract Reports (ISR)) submitted under those contracts for the last three years. If targets were not met on referenced contracts, provide an explanation as to why. In addition, provide an explanation for any SF294/eSRS ISR not submitted for a contract referenced. Small business offerors may submit the total dollar value percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to LB, HUBZone, SB, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB firms, and HBCUs/MIs for each contract referenced. If subcontracts were not awarded to all small business categories, provide an explanation as to why, for each category that did not receive subcontract work. If a contract(s) referenced under Past Performance Volume I did not include a SF294/eSRS ISR or subcontracts were not awarded to small business categories, along with an explanation, offerors may provide a SF294/eSRS ISR(s) or subcontract information for a relevant contract(s) not referenced in Past Performance Volume I. L-5. JFAST LIBRARY (a) The Government has compiled a JFAST Library (the Library) containing documents and information that may be useful to an Offeror in the preparation of a proposal. (b) The information contained in the Library is considered Protected Information and shall be disclosed only to those parties (Parties) who intend to offer a proposal for the JFAST competition, are identified in writing to the Contracting Officer (including subcontractors), and signed the provided non-disclosure agreement. (c) The Prime Offeror may obtain one Protected Information CD-ROM for its use and one CD-ROM for each of its identified subcontractor(s). The Prime Offeror shall be the recipient for the Protected Information CDROM(s) from the Contracting Officer and is responsible for the distribution to its identified subcontractor(s) and ensuring that adequate precautions are taken to prevent disclosure of protected information. The Contracting Officer will not provide Protected Information CD-ROM(s) to any party other than the identified Prime Offeror and assumes no responsibility for authorized distribution of the Protected Information CD-ROM(s) to the Prime Offeror`s subcontractors. (d) The Prime Offeror shall forward the original signed copy of the non-disclosure agreement (Attachment 11) to the Contracting Officer. The NDA shall be signed by a Prime Offeror Company Representative with legal authority to bind the company for this proposal. The Prime Offeror`s NDA assumes responsibility for all subcontractors in receipt of the Library. Primary means of distribution will be in-person, physical pick-up at the TCAQ-S-R office. The Prime Offeror must make an appointment to do so with the Contract Specialists listed in L-1 above. The original signed copy of the NDA must be received by the Contracting Officer (thru the Contract Specialist) before the Protected Information CD-ROM(s) will be released to the Prime Offeror. For any Prime Offeror for which in-person pick-up is not possible, contact TCAQ-S-R for other arrangements. (e) The Prime Offeror will return all Protected Information CD-ROM(s) provided to it by the Contracting Officer upon written request by the Government, contemplated to be prior to contract award.

The Prime Offeror is responsible for the cost of mailing/shipping Protected Information CDROMs to the Contracting Officer.

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 75 of 79 Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award M SOLICITATION PROVISIONS IN FULL TEXT FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SOLICITATION PROVISIONS: 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JUL 1990). Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government`s best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). M-1. BASIS FOR AWARD The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitations requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that it will best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher priced offeror outweighs the cost difference. To arrive at a source selection decision, the SSA will make an integrated assessment based on the evaluation factors described below. A. Evaluation Factors: Factor I: Past Performance

Factor II: Task Order Approach Factor III: Cost & Price Factor IV: Small Business Commitment All evaluation factors, other than price, when combined, are considered significantly more important than price. In addition, the factors of Past Performance and Task Order Approach are considered of equal importance. Small Business Commitment will be rated on an acceptable / unacceptable basis. B. Factor I - Past Performance 1. Past performance will be evaluated as a measure of the Government`s confidence in the offeror`s ability to successfully perform the requirements of the solicitation based on current and recent past performance efforts. The Government will consider past performance information identified by each offeror, as well as any additional past performance information obtained by the Government, in determining an overall past performance confidence assessment rating for each offeror. The term past performance, as used in this solicitation, includes both current and recent past performance. 2. The Government will begin its evaluation by first determining the recency and the relevancy of each past performance effort being evaluated. To be considered a recent effort, the effort must be currently on-going, or have been completed within three (3) years of proposal submission. Relevant performance is defined as having current or recent (within the last 3 years) experience in some or all of the Performance Areas identified in Section L. In addition, experience in multiple areas will be considered more relevant than experience in only one area.

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 76 of 79

3. The following definitions will be utilized to determine the relevancy of past performance:

Rating Highly Relevant (HR)

Definition Past performance efforts in the specific performance areas identified in Section L involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities as those identified in the solicitation. Past performance efforts in the specific performance areas identified in Section L involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities as those identified in the solicitation. Past performance efforts in the specific performance areas identified in Section L involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities as those identified in the solicitation. Past performance efforts in the specific performance areas identified in Section L did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities as those identified in the solicitation.

Relevant (R)

Somewhat Relevant (SR)

Not Relevant (NR)

4. After the Government has determined the recency of each past performance effort being evaluated, along with the relevancy of those efforts, one of the following overall Past Performance Confidence Assessment ratings will be assigned to each offeror: Rating High Confidence Significant Confidence Satisfactory Confidence Little Confidence No Confidence Neutral/Unknown Confidence Definition Based on the offeror`s performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror`s performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror`s performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror`s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the contractor will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror`s performance record, extreme doubt exists that the contractor will successfully perform the required effort No relevant performance record is identifiable

Note: If an offeror does not have any relevant past performance, that offeror will receive an overall Past Performance rating of Neutral/Unknown Confidence which will be considered neither favorably or unfavorably. 5. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. 6. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Section L. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g., the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 77 of 79

C. Factor II - Task Order Approach 1. Color/adjectival ratings will be used for rating this factor. Each offeror`s proposal will be given a color/adjectival rating using the table at paragraph F. The color/adjectival ratings depict how well the offeror`s proposal meets the measures of merit and solicitation requirements. The Government will also assess any proposal risk (see table at paragraph G) that could potentially lead to Offeror`s poor performance and could jeopardize the success of the program. 2. Measures of merit for this factor are met when the offeror submits: a. A sound plan for accomplishing the requirements of the task order within the required period of performance. The plan shall adequately identify all major project activities in logical order and realistic milestone dates. b. A sound approach as reflected in a personnel matrix which identifies all labor categories the contractor will use in performing the task order that properly correlates positions by labor category to the PWS paragraphs and reflects a realistic approach to accomplishing the requirements of the PWS. D. Factor III ­ Cost & Price 1. Cost/Price will be evaluated but not rated. Cost/Price will be evaluated against proposed labor rates against the base and option periods of the IDIQ contract, and against the overall proposed price for the task order. 2. A price reasonableness and realism analysis will be performed on the labor rates as provided in the Contract Labor Rate Table for the base period and all option periods. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options. 3. A price reasonableness and realism analysis will be performed on the task order and on the overall price of Task Order 0001. 4. Each offeror's proposal will be evaluated as follows: (i). Completeness - Offerors` proposals will be reviewed to determine the extent to which the cost/pricing elements of the offer have been addressed. (ii). Fair and Reasonable - the Government will conduct a price analysis to determine whether the proposed prices are considered fair and reasonable. (iii). Realism - the Government will conduct a price realism analysis to determine whether specific elements of the proposal reflect a clear understanding of and sound approach to the requirements and are consistent with the unique methods of performance described in the offeror` proposal. When an offer is evaluated as unrealistically low, risks associa ted with this fact will be identified and considered in the evaluation of all areas of the Offeror`s proposal as deemed necessary by the Government. 5. The Government will consider the total evaluated price of each proposal when making a best value decision. E. Factor IV - Small Business Commitment. The Government will evaluate this factor on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable. 1. This measure of merit is met when the Offeror:

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 78 of 79 (i). Provides a Small Business Commitment Statement which demonstrates a sound approach for utilizing small businesses into the Offeror`s approach and the level of small business commitment that they demonstrate. Offeror proposes small business subcontracting goals which meet or exceed all of the USTRANSCOM established small business subcontracting goals; and (ii). Provides evidence that established subcontracting goals for all small business categories were consistently met or exceeded under current or prior commercial or government contracts, or provided acceptable justification for not being able to consistently meet all goals.

F. RATINGS Color/adjectival ratings will be used for rating Factor II, Task Order Approach. Each offeror`s proposal will be given a color/adjectival rating based on the below criteria. The color/adjectival rating depicts how well the offeror`s proposal meets factors and solicitation requirements: . Color Rating Definition

Blue

Exceptional

Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the Government; proposal must have one or more strengths and no weaknesses to receive a blue. Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements delineated in the Request for Proposal; proposal rated green must have no weaknesses. Does not clearly meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements delineated in the Request for Proposal, but any such uncertainty is correctable. Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements; proposal has one or more deficiencies. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.

Green

Acceptable

Yellow

Marginal

Red

Unacceptable

Strengths are defined as a significant aspect of an offeror`s proposal that has merit and exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that is advantageous to the Government. Weaknesses are defined as a significant aspect of an offeror`s proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. G. RISK ASSESSMENT Proposal risk includes an assessment of the risks associated with a contractor`s proposed approach, weaknesses in the proposed approach, and weaknesses in the proposal itself. Proposal risk will be assigned at the factor level and one of the following proposal risk ratings will be assigned: Risk Rating High Definition Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring. Can potentially cause disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties. Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of

Moderate

Low

HTC711-09-R-0036 Page 79 of 79 performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties.
