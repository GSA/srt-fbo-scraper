OVERVIEW

This Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (FS) ­ Washington Office (WO)-Operations, 1720 Peachtree St., NW, Suite 700, Atlanta, GA 30309, hereinafter referred to as FS, to obtain the services of one General "Prime" Contractor (GC), and also referred to as Offeror or Contractor, who shall be singularly responsible to satisfy the terms of the resulting contract. FS has developed five in-house training courses for delivering on-demand training to agency Acquisition Management (AQM) staff and customers. The five training courses include (1) Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) Training for Service COTRs, (2) Grants and Agreements Program Manager Training and (3) Stewardship Agreements Training, (4) Grants and Agreements Program Manager, Process Improvement Training and (5) Grants and Agreements Specialist Training. These courses were developed in PowerPoint or MS Word by in-house teams of technical specialists. The FS now requires contractor assistance in getting the training courses ready for publication in the USDA online learning system, AgLearn, in accordance with the scope of work, and contract requirements included herein. Additional details on the requirements are available in the sections that follow.
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS ­ See Section L ­ Instructions

SECTION C--DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK

SCOPE OF CONTRACT This contract requires custom computer programming services and/or development of training using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) training software and related work in compliance with its terms, specifications, and provisions. This includes furnishing labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals. The contractor will review the current courses, make recommendations on improvement to layout, graphics, and flow (if applicable), implement government-approved recommendations in the training courses, and convert the courses to a format that meets all AgLearn online training requirements, as included in Attachment 1. The government will have at least two opportunities to review and recommend updates to the training prior to final approval. Reference the "Contract Deliverables" section for additional details on the testing and approval process. The content for each course has already been developed by the government. For details on each course in terms of number of modules and number of slides per module, please reference Attachment 2. The government may increase or decrease the total number of slides per course by up to 15 without contract modification, if slides are added or removed prior to provision of the modules to the successful vendor. The training vendor will travel to two government-specified locations to record the audio portion of the course as narrated by FS-identified experts: Medford, OR (Stewardship Agreements Training) and Arlington, VA (all other Grants and Agreements Training). The narration for the fifth course (Contracting Officer's Technical Representative Training for Service Contracts) will be done by a consultant who will travel to the vendor's place of business to record the training. The method used to develop the training is at the vendor's discretion. The vendor may elect to offer one or two training formats for each course. If the vendor's proposed solution is not Section 508 compliant, the vendor must develop the same course using a tool that is Section 508 compliant as well (resulting in the creation of 10 training courses versus five). Currently, the Forest Service often develops in-house training using Lectora for the training version that is not compliant with Section 508 but meets the government's needs for user interaction, and CourseAvenue for the Section 508 compliant version of the course. Other vendors have been successful in the past by developing the training in HTML directly.

AG-3187-S-11-0035 WO Operations Aglearn Conversion PAGE 17 of 36

EMPLOYEES (OCT 2007) (a) The contractor shall comply with the personal identity verification (PIV) policies and procedures established by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Directives 4620-002 series. (b) Should the results of the PIV process require the exclusion of a contractor's employee, the contracting officer will notify the contractor in writing. (c) The contractor must appoint a representative to manage compliance with the PIV policies established by the USDA Directives 4620-002 series and to maintain a list of employees eligible for a USDA LincPass required for performance of the work. (d) The responsibility of maintaining a sufficient workforce remains with the contractor. Employees may be barred by the Government from performance of work should they be found ineligible or to have lost eligibility for a USDA LincPass. Failure to maintain a sufficient workforce of employees eligible for a USDA LincPass may be grounds for termination of the contract. (e) The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. (f) The PIV Sponsor for this contract is a designated program point of contact, which in most cases is the Contracting Officer Representative (COR), unless otherwise specified in this contract. The PIV Sponsor will be available to receive contractor identity information from 9:00 AM Monday to 5:00PM Friday at the Washington DC office. The Government will notify the contractor if there is a change in the PIV Sponsor, the office address, or the office hours for registration; however, it is the contractor's responsibility to meet all aspects of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e).

52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (APR 2008) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. "Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.

AG-3187-S-11-0035 WO Operations Aglearn Conversion PAGE 18 of 36

"Registered in the CCR database" means that-- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS+4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS+4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number-- (i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business name. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code. (iv) Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical).

(v) Company telephone number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the CCR database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

AG-3187-S-11-0035 WO Operations Aglearn Conversion PAGE 20 of 36

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

FAR 52.246-20 Warranty of Services (MAY 2001) (a) Definition. "Acceptance," as used in this clause, means the act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of existing and identified supplies, or approves specific services, as partial or complete performance of the contract. (b) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government or any provision concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants that all services performed under this contract will, at the time of acceptance, be free from defects in workmanship and conform to the requirements of this contract. The Contracting Officer shall give written notice of any defect or nonconformance to the Contractor 365 calendar days from final acceptance. This notice shall state either-(1) That the Contractor shall correct or reperform any defective or nonconforming services; or (2) That the Government does not require correction or reperformance. (c) If the Contractor is required to correct or reperform, it shall be at no cost to the Government, and any services corrected or reperformed by the Contractor shall be subject to this clause to the same extent as work initially performed. If the Contractor fails or refuses to correct or reperform, the Contracting Officer may, by contract or otherwise, correct or replace with similar services and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the Government thereby, or make an equitable adjustment in the contract price. (d) If the Government does not require correction or reperformance, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price.

Any changes provided by the offeror are applicable to this solicitation only, and do not result in an update to the representations and certifications posted on ORCA.

FAR 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (DEC 2008) (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-- (A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing

AG-3187-S-11-0035 WO Operations Aglearn Conversion PAGE 27 of 36

with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

FAR 52.219-28 Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation. (APR 2008)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options.

Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity. (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. (2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract. (3) For long-term contracts-- (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter. (c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/ . (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update. (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause. (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed: The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code ______________ assigned to contract number ______________.[Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].

Introduction
Purpose
The intent of this document is to provide developers of content for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)a better understanding of the USDA Information Technology (IT) environment, as well as the standards and requirements that apply to content developed for the USDA. This document is meant to be an overview and is not a substitute to any appropriate documentation regarding the specific technologies referenced herein. The technical specifications contained within this document are based on industry standards and best practices and are provided as guidance and references for designers and developers in the creation of content for the USDA. Content developers should also note that the IT environment at USDA is constantly evolving, as are industry standard technologies and best practices. Contact the USDA's AgLearn Office with questions regarding the compatibility of content or practices with the USDA IT infrastructure.

Audience
It is assumed that content developers have knowledge of and/or experience with:  Multiple delivery environments including UNIX web servers and CD-ROMs  Industry standard web technologies including HTML, DHTML, XML, CSS, and JavaScript  Information architecture and file management best practices including directory structures and the use of file naming conventions  Techniques for creating accessible content meeting the requirements for Section 508 Compliancy  Requirements for creating Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) version 1.2 conformant content

Environmental Considerations
It is important to consider how content will be delivered, managed, and potentially reused or repurposed. All content designed and developed for distribution within the USDA must allow for a variety of environmental variances without negatively impacting the user's viewing experience. These variances may include whether or not the content is to be delivered via the USDA Intranet, the Internet, or physical digital media such as CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. Some of the factors to consider when assessing the delivery environment include:

4

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

Server Platform
All AgLearn+ servers used in staging and production are UNIX based servers and content should be developed with the UNIX platform in mind. UNIX is a case-sensitive platform, therefore case conventions and standards must be carefully followed, especially when naming and referencing files and directories.

Network Bandwidth
When delivering courses across a network, identify the expected bandwidth and how it will affect any multimedia elements contained in the course. As a general best practice, it is recommended that all content be developed assuming delivery across a low bandwidth 56kbps connection. This will allow for the same content to be delivered both to users with higher bandwidth connections, and to those without network connections via a CDROM-based delivery.

Network Security
For purposes of security when dealing with SSI content, this access has been designed to incorporate a content caching capability and code has been implemented to clear cached content from the local computer cache at the end of each session. Presently, this solution works for SSI content in the HTML, SWF, PDF, and MS Office formats. For non-SSI courseware, caching is not a concern from a security standpoint; however the performance of this content is still affected by the caching Implementation.

Cross-Domain Scripting Issues
It is a known issue within the SCORM community that courses typically cannot be delivered by an LMS if the course content resides within another domain; a domain being defined as a web URL, not an IP address. For example, "www.abc.com" is not the same as "www.xyz.com". The source of this restriction is the JavaScript used to implement and support SCORM functionality, which is often not permitted for security reasons. It is necessary to fully understand this issue if the courseware is intended to be delivered or distributed across multiple domains. A complete description of this issue and possible solutions can be found in the document "Cross-Domain Scripting Issue, Version 1.0" from the ADL. This is not currently an issue for the USDA IT infrastructure as both the content and application reside within the same web domain, but it should be noted, as the platform is susceptible to change. NOTE: For additional information on cross-domain scripting and SCORM, refer to the ADL website (http://www.adlnet.org). Additionally, cross-domain scripting is currently not allowed by USDA.

Host Platform Specifications
+ Production Environment Currently, all live and approved content reside within the USDA's production environment. No courseware testing can be administered on this server. A separate staging environment is configured to support content testing for both developers and for the USDA course owners. In addition, telecommunications impact assessments are also conducted within staging. No content will be migrated to the production environment until all phases of testing have been completed on staging. Staging Environment Enables content developers to log into the system from external locations for the purposes of testing using generic login accounts. Team AgLearn should be contacted at TeamAgLearn@usda.gov to obtain a generic login account. These accounts are shared and rotated between vendors as required. So do not consider your account assignment a permanent assignment. In addition, the production database has been migrated back to the staging environment. This allows USDA users and administrators access to the staging environment using their regular AgLearn+ eAuthentication logins.

End-User Platform Specifications
USDA End-Users will be using any combination hardware, software, and OS to access AgLearn+ content. The most current requirements can be found by visiting: https://aglearn.usda.gov/plateau/softwarechecker/checkSoftware.do?showDetail=Y

Courseware Expectations
The usability of courseware content is of utmost importance, including clarity of the navigational structure, the means of navigating the content (the actual controls for navigation), accessibility both as mandated by Section 508 and as would be generally accepted in industry best practice, and any other aspects of the courseware that affects the user experience. While the intent of the AgLearn+ is to deliver web-based training, lack of connectivity in some locations or the inaccessibility of a training room to a screener requires that all content be deliverable as both WBT and CBT. Some considerations of the dual purposing of content include limited scripting language support, file size optimization, and file type limitations. Server-side scripting languages such as .php and .asp should be avoided in favor of JavaScript, which would allow the same content to be delivered on both a CD-ROM or over a web environment without any significant changes to the code. Content must not require Internet access to any remote files (such as those residing on a vendor's host server) since external Internet access may not be available in some locations. Content should load quickly over a range of bandwidths and network speeds including dial-up connections and LANs. Best practices for achieving this include the optimization of file types and sizes using the following techniques: + Web-native content For standard web-native content, which may include HTML, graphical elements, JavaScript scripting, etc, the total load not including any cached items should not exceed 80KB in size. GIFs, JPGs, and PNGs for graphical purposes Any images used as part of course content should be in the .gif, .jpg, or .png format. Ideally the .png format is reserved only for use when the alpha transparency feature of a .png is absolutely necessary, as some older web browsers are not capable of displaying this file format. When using any of these file types, it is recommended that their file size does not exceed 60KB in size. SWFs for content/animation/interactive graphics A benefit to using Flash for courseware content includes the ability to break down an animation or interaction into multiple files that load individually to a user's computer. This speeds the initial appearance of the content and allows a developer to manipulate the efficiency of the animation's loading by dictating which externally loaded .swf files load and when. When using the .swf file format for graphical animation purposes, it is recommended that each individual file be a maximum of 70KB to 100KB in size. 7

+

+

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

+

SWFs for audio/video Multimedia content including audio and video should be optimized for delivery over low bandwidth connections. Currently, Macromedia Flash is the preferred format for multimedia type content being delivered over the USDA IT infrastructure. A benefit to using Flash is the ability to break down content into multiple files that load individually to a user's computer. It is recommended that no single .swf used for audio/video multimedia file be larger than 40MB in size. Other graphical/audio/video formats Bandwidth intensive formats including .avi, .mpeg, or other audio/video formats that may significantly negatively impact the performance of the USDA network are generally not recommended for use in courseware content. If a new technique or format outside of those recommended by the USDA AgLearn+ is desired, a vendor should deliver content to act as a "preliminary technical test" for compatibility testing with the USDA infrastructure prior to the start of development work. Bookmarking Book marks should be placed in the course that allow the user to either re-enter the course where they exited or to re-enter the course at a sound re-starting point such as a topic or chapter.

SCORM
Overview
The Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) is a model that references a set of interrelated technical specifications and guidelines designed to meet the Department of Defense's high-level requirements for Web-based learning content. In a nutshell, SCORM was developed by the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) initiative for the Department of Defense as a means of constructing and presenting "learning objects". It is important to note that SCORM is basically an amalgamation of several different preexisting standards. The SCORM standard is comprised of the following standards governing the setup and presentation of online content:

As shown above, SCORM treats each individually referenced specification as a separate "book". With the release of version 1.2, the SCORM was divided into three books (Overview, CAM, and RTE). SCORM 2004 added the Sequencing and Navigation specification. Each of these books are available from the ADL website. + + Overview Covers areas of the CAM, RTE, and SN books at a high level. Content Aggregation Model - CAM The SCORM Content Aggregation Model contains guidance for identifying and aggregating resources into structured learning content. This standard describes 19

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

the content of the imsmanifest.xml file which details the course structure, supporting meta-data and sequencing information (SCORM 2004 only). The imsmanifest.xml is the file used by an LMS to import SCORM content. + Run-Time Environment - RTE The SCORM Run-Time Environment includes guidance for launching, communicating with and tracking content in a web-based environment. This book was originally derived from the run-time environment functionality defined in AICC's CMI001 Guidelines for Interoperability. It details the responsibilities of both the content and the LMS regarding the communication of tracking data. Sequencing & Navigation (SCORM 2004 only) The SCORM SN book describes how SCORM conformant content may be sequenced through a set of learner-initiated or system-initiated navigation events. This defines how a learner may proceed through a particular course.

+

NOTES:   This site will discuss the SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004 CAM, RTE, and SN as they pertain to AgLearn+. The Run-Time Environment (content communication) standard for SCORM 1.2 was taken from AICC Appendix B (API method) so the SCORM 1.2 and AICC data models are essentially the same. SCORM 2004 diverged slightly from the original AICC spec, but much of the functionality remains the same.



20

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

The SCORM Communication API

Initially, the SCORM communication model was borrowed from the AICC Appendix B (API) model and thus uses many of the same data elements discussed in the AICC portion of this site. As shown above, SCORM communication is processed by a clientside API provided by the LMS. The content object (SCO - sharable content object) communicates with the API through a series of SCORM-defined javascript function calls. The API processes the functions and handles the communication with the LMS. SCORM 2004 introduced some additional functionality which moved beyond the original AICC communication model. For a comparison of SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004, please see the SCORM 1.2 vs SCORM 2004 page of this site. The basic idea is any SCORM compliant LMS will provide an API that understands a set of SCORM-defined javascript functions. All the messy details of communicating with the LMS are handled by the API, thus allowing SCORM content to communicate with any SCORM compliant LMS simply by using the predefined API functions. 21

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

NOTES:  If SCORM content is NOT hosted under the same DNS (someserver.yourcompany.com) as the LMS, the browser will prevent the SCO from communicating with the API. Please see the Cross-Domain Restriction page of this site for more information. For a listing of the functions and parameters supported by AgLearn+'s API, please see the appropriate SCORM technical section of this document.



SCORM 1.2 API Calls Supported By AgLearn+
As discussed in the API Communication Overview page, SCORM content communicates with an LMS via a client-side API. This API is designed to process a set of functions (defined by SCORM), and relay the information to the LMS. It is important to note the communication portion of SCORM 1.2 was borrowed from the AICC standard and thus shares roughly the same data model as AICC. For a list of the data elements used in AICC communication, please refer to the Standard AICC_DATA Values page of this site.

LMSInitialize( )

The content must call this function before calling any other API function. It indicates to the LMS system that the content is going to communicate. The LMS can take any initialization steps required in this function. For instance, this can contact the CMI via AICC messaging to pull down the cmi.core variables for quick access.

LMSGetValue( )

This function is used to pass data from the CMI to the content. Only one value is returned for each call. The category and/or element is named in the parameter. The following LMSGetValue parameters are supported by AgLearn+:


cmi.core._children - returns "student_id, 22

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

    

     

         

student_name, lesson_location, credit, lesson_status, entry, score, total_time, exit, session_time"ˇ cmi.core.student_id cmi.core.student_name cmi.core.lesson_location - 255 char string typically used for bookmarking cmi.core.credit - returns "no-credit" or "credit" cmi.core.lesson_status - indicates SCO completion - returns one of the following: "passed", "completed", "failed", "incomplete", "browsed", or "not attempted" cmi.core.entry - returns "ab-initio", "resume", or "" cmi.core.score._children - returns "raw, min, max" cmi.core.score.raw - the raw score value cmi.core.score.max - the maximum possible score if not set, assumed 100 cmi.core.score.min - the minimum possible score if not set, assumed 0 cmi.core.total_time - returns the sum of all a learner's session times cmi.core.lesson_mode - returns "browse", "normal", or "review" cmi.suspend_data - 4096 char string usually used for progress data cmi.launch_data - 4096 char string used to pass data to the SCO on launch from the LMS cmi.objectives._children - returns "id, score, status" cmi.objectives._count - returns the number of objectives currently stored for this SCO. cmi.objectives.n.id - returns the objective identifier where "n" is the objective number cmi.objectives.n.score._children - returns "raw, min, max " cmi.objectives.n.score.raw - the raw objective score value cmi.objectives.n.score.min - The minimum possible score - if not set, assumed 0 cmi.objectives.n.score.max - the maximum possible objective score - if not set, assumed 100 cmi.objectives.n.status - indicates if the learner has completed the objective - returns one of the 23

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

following: "passed", "completed", "failed", "incomplete", "browsed", or "not attempted" The following are legitimate element names, but are writeonly. These would therefore return "" and set an error: 404 element is write-only.
 

cmi.core.exit cmi.core.session_time

LMSSetValue( )

This function is used to pass data from the content to the LMS. The parameter indicates which category or element is being set. Only one value may be set with a single function call. The following LMSSetValue parameters are supported by AgLearn+:
 

         

cmi.core.lesson_location - 255 char string usually used for bookmarking cmi.core.lesson_status - indicates SCO completion - accepts "passed", "completed", "failed", "incomplete", "browsed", "not attempted" cmi.core.score.raw - the raw score value cmi.core.score.max - the maximum possible score if not set, assumed 100 cmi.core.score.min - the minimum possible score if not set, assumed 0 cmi.core.exit - indicates how the learner left the SCO - accepts "time-out", "suspend", or "logout" cmi.core_session_time - Time spent in the SCO HHHH:MM:SS.SS cmi.suspend_data - 4096 char string usually used for progress data cmi.objectives.n.id - the objective identifier where "n" is the objective number cmi.objectives.n.score.raw - the raw objective score value cmi.objectives.n.score.min - The minimum possible score - if not set, assumed 0 cmi.objectives.n.score.max - the maximum 24

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0



possible objective score - if not set, assumed 100 cmi.objectives.n.status - indicates if the learner has completed the objective - accepts "passed", "completed", "failed", "incomplete", "browsed", or "not attempted"

The following are legitimate element names, but are readonly. These would therefore return "false" and set an error: 403 - element is read-only:
      

cmi.core.student_id cmi.core.student_name cmi.core.credit cmi.core.entry cmi.core.total_time cmi.core.lesson_mode cmi.launch_data

The following elements are legitimate element names, but are keywords for multiple elements. These would therefore return "" and set the error code 402 - "Invalid set value, element is a keyword":
    

cmi.core._children cmi.core.score._children cmi.objectives._children cmi.objectives._count cmi.objectives.n.score._children

LMSCommit( )

Any values set using the LMSSetValue command are stored for delivery. This function submits any values not yet sent to the LMS.

LMSFinish( )

The content must call this function before it terminates, if it successfully called LMSInitialize at any point. It signals to the LMS that the content has finished communicating. The content may not call any API function except 25

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

LMSGetLastError after it calls LMSFinish

LMSGetLastError( )

This function provides content with a way of assessing whether or not any given API call was successful, and if it was not successful, what went wrong. This routine returns an error code from the previous API call. Each time an API function is called (with the exception of this one), the error code is reset in the API. The content may call this any number of times to retrieve the error code, and the code will not change until the next API call.

LMSGetErrorString( )

This function returns a textual description of the error represented by an error code number.

LMSGetDiagnostic( )

This function would return an LMS-specific error description based on an error code number.

NOTE: For more detailed information, please refer to SCORM Run Time Environment document included in the Resources section of this guide.

Making The SCORM API Visible For Debugging
The SCORM API can be made visible in AgLearn+, allowing a user to monitor the communication between the content and the API. To make the applet visible, edit the main_online_frameset.jsp page in AgLearn+. Open the main_online_frameset.jsp page in a text editor such as notepad and remove the two slashes ("//") before the following line: //debugMode = "1";

26

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

NOTES:  It may be necessary to clear the application server cache after making changes to JSP files  If you are running AgLearn+ on a Weblogic application server, the main_online_frameset.jsp will be in the elms.war package which is inside the elms.ear file. In addition, you will need to remove the servlet-mapping for the main_online_frameset.jsp in the web.xml file (also in the elms.war package).  If you are running AgLearn+ on a Weblogic application server, the main_online_frameset.jsp will be in the elms.war package which is inside the elms.ear file. In addition, you will need to remove the servlet-mapping for the main_online_frameset.jsp in the web.xml file (also in the elms.war package).

SCORM Import SCORM content usually contains files which are used by an LMS to import the course definitions. The primary import file is the imsmanifest.xml which may or may not have supporting xml files. It is important to note that the actual content is not imported into the LMS, just the definition or setup of the content (the Content Package and Content Object definitions). A SCORM imsmanifest.xml file may be divided into three primary parts.  The Resources Section  The Organizations Section  Supporting Meta-data The Resources section is composed of a single <resources> element which contains one or <resource> elements. Individual <resource> elements define individual pieces of content which may be either an Asset or a SCO. An asset is simply a piece of content which does not contain code to communicate SCORM data. A SCO is content which contains code for SCORM communication. Resource elements contain the following attributes:

<resource> Attribute

Description

adlcp:scormtype

Identifies the resource as either an "asset" or a "sco

27

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

identifier

Unique ID for the resource. Used in the Organizations section to reference the resource.

type

Defines the type of resource. Always defined as "webcontent".

href

Required for SCO resources. This is the filepath to the resource.

The Organizations section is composed of a single <organizations> element which typically contains a single, but may contain multiple, <organization> elements. An organization element defines a course structure using one or more <item> elements. An item may map to a <resource> resulting in a content object, or an item may contain other item elements resulting in a folder in the course structure. In AgLearn+, an item referencing a "sco" type resource is imported as a SCORM type content object and an item referencing an "asset" type resource is imported as a content object that is configured to "mark complete on launch". Item elements contain the following attributes:

<item> Attribute

Description

Identifierref

Ties the item to a resource through the resource identifier attribute.

28

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

Identifier

Unique ID for the item.

parameters

isvisible

Indicates if the item is visible in the LMS course structure.

The above sample would result in the following structure:

Supporting Meta-data is defined in a <metadata> element and may be applied to individual <resourse>, <organization>, or <item> elements. Meta-data elements may be defined in the imsmanifest.xml file itself or in supporting xml documents identified in the <metadata> element. In the following example, metadata for SCO R_S110002 is defined in a supporting xml document named sco03.xml.

29

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

A metadata element can contain a wide array of information most of which is irrelevant to an LMS. AgLearn+ only pulls the follwing elements from supporting meta-data.  Title - Defined in a <title> element under the <general> element  Description information - defined in a <description> element under the <general> element.  Educational Objective - The objective is pulled from the <description> element under a <classification> element but only if the <puporse> element for the <classification> contains a <value> element defined as "Educational Objective".

The AgLearn+ SCORM Import Assistant prompts the user for a zip file, and will not process any remote file over 1MB. If you have a SCORM course zip file that is over 1MB, and would like to use the import process from a local file, simply extract all the xml files into a new Zip file and use the new file with the import assistant. If you wish to import a zip from a URL, the zip file will need to be hosted on a web server that shares the same DNS as the LMS server (something.somethingelse.com), and a fully-qualified path (http://...) to the zip file must be provided. SCORM 2004 introduced sequencing elements to the imsmanifest fle. Please see the SCORM Sequencing page of this site for more details.

Cross-Domain Communication Restriction
Content can communicate with AgLearn+ using one of two technologies; a direct HTTP Post or via a client-side API. AICC content uses direct HTTP posts to send information to AgLearn+. SCORM content uses a client-side API. The Plateau Tracking Functions can use either direct HTTP posts or a client-side API. When content is using a client-side API for communication, that content must be hosted under the same DNS as the API it is attempting to use. If the content and the API are hosted under separate DNS names, the browser will prevent them from communicating. It is important to note that this is not a AgLearn+ specific issue. It is a restriction that is inherent in the SCORM communication standard.

33

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

In the diagram above, the content and the API's are hosted under the same DNS. As a result, the content can access both the SCORM and Plateau Tracking API's for communication.

34

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

In the diagram above, the content and the API's are hosted under separate DNS names, preventing them from communicating with one another. Under this scenario, only direct HTTP posts may be used for communication.

If it is necessary to host your content under a separate DNS, several solutions exist to work around the cross-domain restriction. ADL, the writers of the SCORM spec, have compiled a collection of potential solutions for the cross-domain issue. This paper is available below and can also be found on the ADL web site (http://adlnet.org):
ADL Cross-Domain Scripting Issue v2.0 ADL Cross-Domain Proxy Solution

Solutions discussed in the ADL paper fall under three categories:  Combination LMS and content solution  Network architecture solution 35

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0



LMS-based solution

Reverse Proxy
One common network architecture solution to work around the cross-domain restriction is the reverse proxy. This is essentially a proxy server that sits in front of the LMS and any content servers in your environment. All requests for the LMS or content are routed through the reverse proxy and are forwarded to the appropriate servers based on the context of the request. For example, if your network contained the following servers:  LMS = http://lms.customer.com/elms/learner/login.jsp  Content Server 1 = http://content.customer.com/content1/course_x/sco_x.htm  Content Server 2 = http://content2.customer.com/content2/course_y/index.htm  A reverse proxy server (http://revProxy.customer.com) could be added to your network with the following rules:  route any "/elms" request to "http://lms.customer.com/elms"  route any "/content1" request to "http://content.customer.com/content1"  route any "/content2" request to "http://content2.customer.com/content2"  This would allow a user to use the following reverse proxy requests to access the LMS or content:  LMS = http://revProxy.customer.com/elms/learner/login.jsp  Content Server 1 = http://revProxy.customer.com/content1/course_x/sco_x.htm  Content Server 2 = http://revProxy.customer.com/content2/course_y/index.htm The browser would see the content and the LMS as coming from the same DNS and thus the cross-domain restriction would not apply. The ADL Cross-Domain Proxy Solution paper discusses the implementation and configuration of the reverse proxy solution in detail.

Proxlet Solution
In AgLearn+ 5.5 an entirely LMS-based solution (no changes required in the content) was introduced. This solution resolves the cross-domain restriction by placing the communication APIs on the content server and relies on a communication proxy (proxlet) on the content server to relay tracking data back to AgLearn+ (section 1.3.8 of the ADL document). It can be thought of as placing part of the LMS, needed by the content for communication, on the content server. This solution is enabled via the LMS configuration files, and requires additional settings at the content object or question object level. This solution resolves the cross-domain restriction for the following APIs:  Plateau Tracking  SCORM 36

PEXAM (external questions for internal exams)

Click Here for information on deploying this solution.

The diagram above shows the LMS-based solution introduced in AgLearn+ 5.5. The content and the APIs are loaded into a wrapper. The APIs communicate back to AgLearn+ via a communication proxy running on the content server.

Document Domain Manipulation
AgLearn+ 4.1 introduced a cross-domain configuration setting in the LMS configuration framework. This setting allows a user to set the domain of the SCORM and Plateau Tracking API's to a root domain. For instance, the diagram above has the API's hosted under LMS.PLATEAU.COM, so AgLearn+ could be configured to host the API's under PLATEAU.COM (it is not possible to specify just COM as a domain). Once AgLearn+'s API's are configured to a root domain, it is possible to use javascript to 37

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

manipulate the domain of the content. The following code can be used to hard code the domain of the content:
<script language="javascript"> document.domain="Plateau.com"; </script>

Or this code can be used to dynamically set the domain to the top root-level domain. For instance, if the domain was MY.CONTENT.SERVER.PLATEAU.COM, this code would set the domain to PLATEAU.COM.
<script language="javascript"> midDotLoc = document.domain.lastIndexOf('.'); dotLoc = document.domain.lastIndexOf('.',midDotLoc-1); document.domain=document.domain.substring(dotLoc+1); </script>

Once the AgLearn+ API domain and the content domain have been set to a common root, the cross-domain restriction no longer applies. and the content will be able to access the APIs.

38

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

Troubleshooting SCORM 1.2 Content
Issues
The following are some issues that have frequently arisen and suggested solutions. Content is unable to find the SCORM API When SCORM content is launched, the first thing it does is to search for the LMS communication piece, an object called "API". The content searches all the frames in it's own window first, and if it does not find the API object, it attempts to search in it's opener window. In AgLearn+, the API is hosted in the learner application, so the content will have to search the opener window to find the API. There are several reasons why the content may not be able to find the API.  Make sure the content is specified as a "SCORM" type content object in AgLearn+ (use "Browser" type for AgLearn+ v.4.2 and earlier). The SCORM 1.2 API is not available to AICC, Browser, SCORM2004 or Document type content objects.  If the content is hosted under a separate DNS name (server name) from the LMS, the content will not be able to access the API. The browser, for security reasons, will prevent the content from searching in the opener window and will usually give an "Access Denied" error. For more information, please see the cross-domain restriction page of this site.  The code that looks for the API may need to be altered. Typically there will be an APIWrapper.js file that contains functions provided by ADL (writers of the SCORM spec). The functions that locate the API are "getAPI" and "findAPI". The getAPI function calls the findAPI function and specifies a window to search. As mentioned above, the content will first search the content window, and then the opener window (AgLearn+ student piece). The getAPI call to search the opener window is usually: theAPI = findAPI(window.opener);  If the SCORM content is using frames, this function call will not make sense to the browser because it will look for the opener of a particular frame. It may be necessary to fix this line of code to search the opener of the frameset as follows: theAPI = findAPI(top.window.opener);  Likewise, if the content is using an opener window to format the content's browser window, the content will be two levels out from the LMS and thus the proper call would need to be: theAPI = findAPI(window.opener.opener);

39

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

Not sure if the content is communicating There are two ways to confirm content communication. The first method is to check the learner record in the AgLearn+ Administrator.  Log-in to AgLearn+ Administrator.  Open the Learners>Online Status tab.  Click the Object Details link to examine the details for the content object. Values updated by SCORM include Total Time, Score, Finished, Complete, Objective Finished, and Objective Complete. This method should allow you to see if the content is communicating, but it will not show you all the SCORM data being stored in the AgLearn+ Database. Since AICC and SCORM share a common data model, it is possible to construct a simple AICC request to obtain all the content data stored in the database. The following page can be used to retrieve AICC or SCORM data from AgLearn+. If no data is recorded for the content, please read the "Content is unable to find the SCORM API" section above. Content is communicating but is not marked complete Content completion is tied to the SCORM Lesson_Status value. AgLearn+ only grants credit for a Lesson_Status value of "passed", however, many content vendors only send a value of "completed". It is possible to configure AgLearn+ to grant credit for a sco sending a Lesson_Status value of "completed". Please see the Lesson_Status section on the AICC Common Issues page for details.

AICC
Overview of AICC
The Aviation Industry CBT (Computer-Based Training) Committee (AICC) is an international association of technology-based training professionals. The AICC develops guidelines for the aviation industry in the development, delivery, and evaluation of CBT and related training technologies. http://www.aicc.org Purpose: AICC provides a standard for communication between training content and learning management systems.

Explanation: As an LMS, AgLearn+ is focused on two facets of the AICC guidelines: + Communication between content and an LMS (AgLearn+). The Communication guidelines set well defined rules for passing information from content to an LMS and vice-versa. The guidelines specify the method by which information should be passed, and the format in which the information should be communicated (analogous to saying we will communicate by telephone and in French). The AICC outlined two means of communicating with online content. These are defined in Appendix A and Appendix B of the AICC CMI Guidelines for Interoperability document. Content setup within an LMS (AgLearn+'s AICC Import Assistant). The AICC guidelines define a set of files used to provide an LMS with course information. These files may be used by an LMS to import the course. It is important to note that the actual content is not imported or exported, just the definition or setup information for the content; the item (component) and content object definitions.

+

AICC Required Data Format AICC communication is performed by HTTP posts comprised of a series of name/value pairs (see the table below).

When AICC content is launched from an LMS, two parameters are appended to the launch url: AICC_SID and AICC_URL. The content retrieves these parameters from the launch path and uses them to communicate back to the LMS (AgLearn+). The AICC_URL is the URL to which AICC data is posted. The AICC_SID is a unique

41

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

identifier for the learner, course, and content object. In an AICC post, the AICC_SID is returned to the LMS under the "session_id" parameter. In AgLearn+, the AICC launch parameters are composed of the following data:  AICC_URL = <LMS protocol>://<LMS DNS>:<LMS port>/<LMS application context>/PwsAicc - for example if a learner logged into the AgLearn+ user application using https://lms.company.com:7008/plateau/user/login.jsp then the AICC_URL would be https://lms.company.com:7008/plateau/PwsAicc. AICC_SID = "C"<studCpntID>"M"<modID>"S" where the studCpntID is a unique numeric identifier for the student and item, and the modID is a unique numeric identifeir for the content object. for example, if the studCpntID = 175 and the modID = 21, then the AICC_SID would be C175M21S.



NOTE: Each student will have a unique AICC_SID for any given content object

Lesson_Status Lesson_Status is used to determine the completion status of the content module. Acceptable values for Lesson_Status are as follows: + Passed (or p) Necessary number of objectives in the lesson were mastered, or the necessary score was achieved. Student is considered to have completed the lesson and passed. Completed (or c) The lesson may or may not be passed, but all the elements in the lesson were experienced by the student. The student is considered to have completed the lesson. Failed (or f) The lesson was not passed. All the lesson elements may or may not have been completed by the student. Incomplete (or i) The lesson was begun but not finished. Not attempted (or n or na) This is the initial lesson_status value set by the LMS. Not attempted means that the student did not even begin the lesson.

Each Lesson_Status value may be followed by one of the following flags: + Time_out (or T) This indicates the lesson ended because the lesson has determined an excessive amount of time has elapsed. Suspend (or S) This indicates the student leaves the lesson with the intent of returning to it later at the point where he/she left off. The LMS will send a resume lesson_status flag the next time the content is launched. Logout (or L) This indicates that the student logged out of the LMS from within the lesson instead of returning to the LMS to log out. The intent is to require reauthentication from the student.

+

+

Rules:    Only the first letter of the lesson_status value is processed, so "P", "pass", and "passed" would all be treated the same. The Lesson_Status and Lesson_Status Flag are separated by a comma (for example: P,L). The flag information is not passed back as part of the Getparam response. The only flags possible when passing information back to the content are the ab initio andresume flags. For more information, please refer to the CMI Guidelines for Interoperability document.

Lesson_location Bookmarking information can be stored using the AICC Lesson_Location value. Each new Lesson_location post overwrites the existing value. The Lesson_Location field is limited to 255 characters. Score

48

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

Indication of the performance of the student during his/her last session in the content object. This score may be determined and calculated in any manner that makes sense to the program designer. For instance, it could reflect the percentage of objectives complete, it could be the raw score on a multiple choice test, or it could indicate the number of correct first responses to the embedded questions in the content object. The score can be a stand-alone value, or may be followed by two values: a maximum and minimum. Where the maximum is the largest score the student could have achieved with the interactions experienced and the minimum is the smallest score that the student could have achieved with the interactions experienced. Format: Decimal number or blank for all three values. If three values are passed, they are separated by commas, and the order is significant: Score, Maximum, Minimum Score Examples: SCORE= 79 Probably a percentage result. Score = 8.0,10.0,0.0 Raw score of 8 with a maximum of 10. AgLearn+ would show a percentage score of 80%. Time Accumulated time of all the student sessions in the content. format: HHHH:MM:SS.SS Integer number representing hours, followed by a colon, an integer from 00 to 59 representing minutes, followed by a colon and a decimal or integer from 00 to 59.99 representing seconds. Three numbers, separated by colons, are always required, even if only seconds or minutes are represented. Examples: TIME=00:29:00 Student spent 29 minutes in lesson. time=01:27:00 Student spent 1 hour 27 minutes in lesson.

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

AICC [Objectives_Status]
The Objectives_Status group allows the content to store information related to the lesson's learning objectives. To link an AICC objective with an AgLearn+ objective, create an objective in AgLearn+ and assign the AICC objective ID as the AgLearn+ "objective" field (not the auto-generated objective ID value). The newly created AgLearn+ objectives can then be assigned to the AICC content module that contains the objectives. AgLearn+ will then update the objective status using the J_Status and J_Score values passed for that objective.

J_Status.1

Objective Status

NOTE: The Objectives Status group can contain multiple objectives differentiated by a unique numeric parameter extension (i.e. J_ID.3 or J_ID.9).

J_Score Values The objective score parameter indicates the score obtained by the student after each attempt to master an objective. A maximum and minimum value may accompany the score. The maximum values indicate the largest score the student could have achieved and the minimum value is the smallest achievable score.   A semicolon separates multiple attempts with the latest attempt listed first. Commas separate maximum and minimum values.

J_Score Examples: 50

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

J_Score.2=87 The student scored an 87 (assumed to be 87%). J_Score.2=2,3 The student scored 2 out of a maximum possible score of 3. J_Score.4=9.5,10,0;6.5,10,0 On the student's first attempt, they scored a 6.5 out of a maximum of 10 and a minimum of 0, and on their second attempt, they scored a 9.5 out of a maximum of 10 and a minimum of 0. J_Status Values The objective status parameter indicates the completion status of the objective. There are five possible statuses: + + Pass (or p or pass) The student has mastered the objective. Complete (or c) The student has gone through all segments of the lesson related to the objective. She may or may not have passed. Fail (or f ) Failed may be followed by a comma and an integer number indicating the number of times the objective has been failed. Incomplete (or i ) The student has not gone through all the segments of the lesson related to this objective. Not attempted (or n or NA) The student has not gone through any of the segments of the lesson related to this objective. Browsed (or b) The student launched the lesson with a CMI mode of Browse on the initial attempt.

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

Using AICC [Core_Vendor] The Core_Vendor group is used to pass data to the lesson on launch. Core_Vendor data can be entered in the content object's "AICC Support" tab within AgLearn+. Core_Vendor data is only passed from the LMS to the content, and cannot be reset by the content. This data may be set automatically by the AICC import assistant from the "Core_Vendor" parameter of the AU import file. This data group is limited to 4096 characters.

Using AICC [Core_Lesson] The Core_Lesson group is contained in the AICC_Data section of a PutParam command. Core_Lesson contains data that is created by the content and stored by the LMS to be passed back to the content the next time it is run. Typically this data is used to store learner progress data. Any new Core_Lesson data will overwrite the existing data. Core_Lesson is limited to 4096 characters. AICC Max Normal Value: 1 to 99, if null it defaults to 1.The Max Normal value may be set manually on the "Online Settings" tab of the item (component), or it may be set automatically by the AICC import assistant from the "max_normal" parameter in the CRS import file. The Max Normal is the maximum number of assignable units (content objects) that may be taken for credit simultaneously. That is, this value indicates how many content objects in an item (component) are allowed to be incomplete at any given time. When the number of incomplete content objects exceeds the Max Normal value, subsequent 53

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

launches of AICC content will be with credit="no credit" (AICC Lesson_Status and Score values cannot be updated). For example, if an item has 5 content objects and the max normal value for the item is set to 3, a student can access up to 3 content objects without completion. If they access and do not complete a fourth content object, any AICC content object they access afterwards will be launched with Credit="No Credit", and the Lesson_Status and Score values will be locked. It is important to note the completion value used for the Max Normal calculation is AgLearn+'s completion status, not AICC's. As a result, the Max Normal calculation is based on all content objects in an item whether they are AICC content objects or not (this also includes exam objects). However, only AICC (and SCORM) content objects are affected if the Max Normal value is exceeded. AICC Import Files In addition to developing a communication guideline, AICC also defined a method of importing content definitions into an LMS. It is important to note that the actual content is not imported, just the definition or setup of the content (the item (component) and content object definitions). Importing the same files twice will produce two sets of data, so any edits that need to be made after importing the content definitions should be made to the actual records in AgLearn+. AgLearn+ supports the following AICC data files: The Course file (*.crs) This file contains course-level information about the course as a whole. The Assignable Unit file (*.au) This file contains technical information relating to all the assignable units (content objects) in the course (i.e. content object launch url). The Descriptor file (*.des) This file contains descriptive information relating to every course element in the course (i.e. content object description). It is used as the basic cross-reference file showing the correspondence of system generated IDs with user-defined IDs for every element. The Course Structure file (*.cst) This file contains the basic data on the content structure of the course. It includes all of the assignable units (content objects) and blocks (folders) in the course. AICC import files may be used with the AICC import assistant in AgLearn+ to automatically generate the item and content object records for a given course. It should

54

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

be noted that the AICC import assistant does not do anything that cannot be done manually through the Admin user interface. AICC import files may be generated for existing online items in AgLearn+ by using the "AICC Export" option on the "Online Settings" tab of an item. The exported files contain the definitions of the item and all associated content objects. These export files can then be imported to another LMS, bringing in the structure of the original item.

AICC Import Files Issues

Lesson_Status Issue The Lesson_Status value is passed as part of the [Core] group of the AICC_Data parameter (see the [Core] Grouppage of this site). Lesson_Status is used to determine the completion status of the content object. Acceptable values for Lesson_Status are as follows:

+ Passed (or p)
Necessary number of objectives in the lesson were mastered, or the necessary score was achieved. Student is considered to have completed the lesson and passed. +

+ Completed (or c)
The lesson may or may not be passed, but all the elements in the lesson were experienced by the student. The student is considered to have completed the lesson. +

+ Failed (or f )
The lesson was not passed. All the lesson elements may or may not have been completed by the student. + 55

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

+

Incomplete (or i) The lesson was begun but not finished.

+ Not attempted (or n or na)
This is the initial lesson_status value set by the LMS. Not attempted means that the student did not even begin the lesson. + + AgLearn+ interprets the values as follows:

AICC Lesson_Status

AgLearn+ Finished (Viewed but not mastered all the material) yes

AgLearn+ Complete (Earned Credit )

Passed yes Completed yes Failed no Incomplete

yes

no

no

no

not attempted

no

no

Some content providers only use Lesson_Status values of "completed" and "incomplete". This presents an issue because AgLearn+ only grants credit if a Lesson_Status value of "passed" is sent (this due to an interpretation difference of the AICC guideline definitions of "Completed" and "Passed" listed above). Configuration for AICC Lesson_Status Work Around In 4.1.1 and above, AgLearn+ may be configured to grant credit for a Lesson_Status value of "completed". Users can configure a keyword for one of the fields listed below, that will trigger AgLearn+ to treat "completed" as "passed".

56

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

     

Item > Source ID - If this field is used, the trigger will be applied to all content objects in the item. Content Object > Developer Tool - Applied to the individual content object only. Content Object > Build Company - Applied to the individual content object only. In AgLearn+ 4.1.1, the completion triggers may be established using the following page: <address of your plateau server + context path>/pwa/sysadmin/configuration_edit.jsp In AgLearn+ 4.2 and above, the configuration is found under the SysAdmin>Configuration>AICC

Note that several triggers will already be configured. To establish a new trigger, copy and paste a complete mapping block for the appropriate field name and edit the "name" value. For example:
<ContentBuildCompany name="TOOLBOOK" ignoreCase="yes"> <LessonStatus vendor="C" aicc="P"/> </ContentBuildCompany>

This block establishes the trigger "TOOLBOOK" for the Build Company field, so if a content object's build company field contains the string "TOOLBOOK", then AgLearn+ will treat an incoming lesson_status value of "completed" as "passed" and grant credit for the object. NOTE: The keyword is case sensitive; the ignoreCase variable applies to the lesson_Status value being communicated.

NOTE: Please make note of the following conditions:   If using Build Company as the trigger, you can have non-trigger data in either Item Source or Developer Tool. If you are using Developer Tool as a trigger, you can have non-trigger data in Item Source, but if an invalid trigger string exists in Build Company, the completion is reset. If you are using Item Source, you cannot have invalid trigger strings in either Build Company or Developer Tool.



AICC Import Files Issues 57

AgLearn+ Courseware Technical Reference Guide Version 1.0

The following issues will cause errors during the AICC import process:  CST file - No empty strings should exist as member place holders. If a block has only three members, then only three members should be listed. (fixed in version 4.2)  AU file- If any values are present for the "command_line" parameter in the AU file, the import process produces a content player type content object rather than an aicc type object. All "command line" parameter values should be removed from the AU file prior to import. (AICC interpretation difference)

AICC SCORM 1.2

Mastery_Score (cmi.student_data.mastery_score) - AgLearn+ versions prior to 5.8 SP2 do not support Mastery_Score. AgLearn+ support for mastery_score only includes passing the value to the content. The AgLearn+ LMS relies on the content to determine if a learner has passed or failed a module.

AICC SCORM 1.2

Time Tracking ­ AgLearn+ treats every time value sent in an AICC post or a SCORM commit independently, and updates the total time value of the module. If multiple time values are sent to AgLearn+ in a single content session, all will be added to the total time value for the module.

AICC SCORM 1.2

Objective Data Tracking - AICC and SCORM Objective data is not tracked unless the objectives exist in the AgLearn+ database and are associated with the content module. The objective IDs for all incoming AICC or SCORM objective data must match existing objectives in the AgLearn+ database. AgLearn+'s SCORM import assistant generates and associates objectives from the imsmanifest metadata, but the AICC import assistant does not generate objective records.
