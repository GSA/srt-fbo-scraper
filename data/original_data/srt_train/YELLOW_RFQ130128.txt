Background The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information. The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by "bridges". The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics. The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol. The Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) is responsible for the operation and management IT infrastructure that supports patient care and research. The infrastructure includes networking equipment, servers, Storage Area Networks (SANS), Virtual Tape Library, desktops, laptops, workstations on wheels (WOW), Sun Ray terminals, Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) applications, custom applications, and other supporting technology systems. The COTS applications, both clinical and administrative, as well as custom applications are hosted on a variety of Windows and UNIX based server technologies located in the Clinical Center Data Center (CCDC). The workflow of the clinicians on the inpatient units, day hospital and outpatient clinics in conjunction with the critical nature of its patient population dictates the need for specialized clinical workstations shared by numerous clinical providers. Shared workstations are located in centralized areas such as the nurse's station, or physician offices, but may also be located in patient examination rooms, individual patient rooms, phlebotomy and pharmacy. The workstations are currently deployed on Dell and Apple Macintosh hardware employing Windows and Mac OS X, managed personal computers with a standard imaged desktop and Flo Healthcare/Emerson 1750/1760 Clinical Workstations on Wheels (WOWS). NIH also uses Sun Ray terminals. Standard imaged desktops, Sun Ray terminals and Clinical WOWs are examples of the shared clinical workstations managed by DCRI which allows multiple clinical and administrative users to use the same set of computers.
