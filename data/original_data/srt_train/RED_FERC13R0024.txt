B.2 STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (v25)



1.0 BACKGROUND



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is an independent agency that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil. FERC’s  is to ensure reliable, efficient, and sustainable energy for consumers. Fulfilling this mission involves pursuing two primary goals:

Ensure that rates, terms and conditions are just, reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.

Promote the development of safe, reliable and efficient energy infrastructure that serves the public interest.



In an effort to support the first goal, the Commission protects consumers through market oversight and surveillance; assuring compliance with tariffs, rules, regulations, and orders; detecting, auditing, and investigating potential violations; and developing and formulating policies and regulations to address emerging issues.  The Commission employs various methods in these activities, including:

Developing surveillance procedures to detect potential manipulation, anticompetitive behavior, and other anomalous activity.

Identifying potential subjects of nonpublic investigations.

Analyzing trading and other complex data related to manipulation or other improper conduct. 

Analyzing long-term electric market trends.

Issuing, coordinating, and developing proposed policy reforms to address emerging issues affecting wholesale and interstate electric energy markets.



In support of these objectives, the Commission issued Order 771 which grants the Commission access to eTags that source, sink or wheel-through the United States’ portions of the Eastern or Western Interconnections. E-Tags were developed as a direct result of the Commission’s open access initiatives in Order Nos. 888 and 889 as more electricity transactions began flowing across longer distances.  A copy of Commission Orders 771, 888 and 889 are available through the FERC eLibrary at http://www.ferc.gov/docs-filing/elibrary.asp



An e-Tag is an electronic request to implement a new interchange transaction as a physical energy flow. E-Tags document the movement of energy across an interchange over a prescribed physical (or contract) path, for a given duration, and for a given energy profile(s), and includes information about the entities with financial responsibilities for the receipt and delivery of the energy. E-Tags specify the physical path of the power by identifying the source and sink and all steps involved in the transaction. To properly account for parallel (or loop) flows, NERC introduced the e-Tag system to provide transmission system operators with the identity of the source of the loop flows impacting their systems.



Order 771 requires e-Tag authors or Authority Services to ensure that the Commission is listed as an addressee on e-Tags.  Access to e-Tag data in this manner will assist the Commission in: 

effectively monitoring interchange transactions, 

preventing price manipulation over interchanges, 

ensuring an efficient and orderly transmission grid, and 

developing well-informed policies related to the electric energy markets.  



The Commission is seeking a contractor to provide access to a comprehensive eTag database solution to enable the Commission’s staff to effectively and efficiently view, query, and analyze e-Tags pursuant to Order 771.  The scope, objective, technical requirements, constraints and deliverables for solution are defined herein. 



2.0 SCOPE



The scope of the solicitation and resulting contract is all work including, but not limited to, labor, materials, hardware, software, administration, and management necessary to deploy, operate, support, maintain and improve/upgrade an eTag database solution to meet the Commission’s objectives set forth in this document.

OBJECTIVE



The objective of this procurement is to acquire the services of a contractor who can provide a comprehensive eTag database solution that collects, stores, organizes, and maintains the e-Tags pursuant to Order 771 in a manner that facilitates effective, efficient, and reliable Commission access to the e-Tags for viewing, querying, and analyzing the information contained therein.

E.6 EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS – COMMERCIAL ITEMS



The Government intends to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, represents the best value to the government. The best value determination will be based on a trade-off analysis of technical/non-price factors and price with technical/non-price evaluation factors (including past performance) being more important than price alone.  The technical/non-price criteria, price criteria and best value determination approach are as follows: 



Technical/non-price evaluation



Technical proposals will be evaluated and given an adjectival rating based on the following four factors:

Technical and Management Approach		

Corporate Capability and Experience		

Personnel Qualifications and Experience		

Past Performance				



Note: the above technical/non-price evaluation factors are listed in their relative order of importance, in descending order of importance, except that an offeror with no corporate experience providing services similar to the services described in the SOO will not be eligible for award.



The technical proposals will be evaluated and given an adjectival rating.  Proposals with the same adjectival rating will be ranked based on relative risk/benefit to the government.  



Proposals with exceptions to the solicitation requirements may be determined to be non-responsive.



Price



Price proposals will be evaluated for completeness, accuracy, compliance with the proposal instructions and consistency with the offeror’s technical proposal.  Proposals will be ranked based of the total price, base year and options inclusive.  Proposals with exceptions to the solicitation requirements may be determined to be non-responsive and not considered for award.  Proposals must be firm fixed price; proposals which include costs in addition to the firm fixed prices will be determined to be non-responsive and not considered for award.



Best value determination approach



After the technical proposals are evaluated and ranked, the government will consider the respective offeror’s total price in making a best value determination.  The government intends to award to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the government.  The best value determination will be based on a trade-off analysis of technical/non-price factors and price with technical/non-price factors (including past performance) being more important than price alone.  Consequently, a proposal with a higher technical rating and a higher price may be selected for award if the government determines that the better, more expensive proposal is the best value.  Conversely, a proposal with a lower technical rating and lower price may be selected for award if the government determines that the lesser, cheaper proposal represents the best value.



Minor irregularities



The government reserves the right to waive minor irregularities in proposals.



Discussions, revised proposals and competitive range



The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised proposals if the contracting officer later determines it is necessary. 



If the contracting officer determines that discussions and revised proposals are necessary the contracting officer reserves the right to limit discussions and receipt of revised proposals to offerors within a competitive range which will be comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.  The contracting officer will inform those offerors whose proposals have been excluded from the competitive range and those proposals will no longer be considered for award.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--

    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;

    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

      (ii) Examples.

        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

    (1) Listed end products.

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
