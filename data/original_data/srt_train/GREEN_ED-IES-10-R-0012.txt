(a) Pending the establishment of final indirect cost rates, as required by the clause entitled "Allowable Cost and Payment" FAR 52.216-7, the Contractor shall be reimbursed for its indirect costs on the basis of the negotiated provisional, or billing, rates as set forth below. Those rates shall remain in effect until the contract is modified to incorporate either negotiated final indirect rates, as directed by either paragraph (d) or (f) of the same clause, as applicable, or revised provisional indirect cost rates, as explained in paragraph (e). (b) The provisional overhead rate(s) applicable to this contract: B. 3 52.217-2 CANCELLATION UNDER MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS (OCT 1997)

(a) "Cancellation," as used in this clause, means that the Government is canceling its requirements for all supplies or services in program years subsequent to that in which notice of cancellation is provided. Cancellation shall occur by the date or within the time period specified in the Schedule, unless a later date is agreed to, if the Contracting Officer(1) Notifies the Contractor that funds are not available for contract performance for any subsequent program year; or (2) Fails to notify the Contractor that funds are available for performance of the succeeding program year requirement. (b) Except for cancellation under this clause or termination under the Default clause, any reduction by the Contracting Officer in the requirements of this contract shall be considered a termination under the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause. (c) If cancellation under this clause occurs, the Contractor will be paid a cancellation charge not over the cancellation ceiling specified in the Schedule as applicable at the time of cancellation. (d) The cancellation charge will cover only-(1) Costs-(i) Incurred by the Contractor and/or subcontractor; (ii) Reasonably necessary for performance of the contract; and (iii) That would have been equitably amortized over the entire multi-year contract period but, because of the cancellation, are not so amortized; and (2) A reasonable profit or fee on the costs. (e) The cancellation charge shall be computed and the claim made for it as if the claim were being made under the Termination for Convenience of the Government clause of this contract. The Contractor shall submit the claim promptly but no later than 1 year from the date-(1) Of notification of the nonavailability of funds; or (2) Specified in the Schedule by which notification of the availability of additional funds for the next succeeding program year is required to be issued, whichever is earlier, unless extensions in writing are granted by the Contracting Officer. (f) The Contractor's claim may include-(1) Reasonable nonrecurring costs (see Subpart 15.4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation) which are applicable to and normally would have been amortized in all supplies or services which are multi-year requirements; (2) Allocable portions of the costs of facilities acquired or established for the conduct of the work, to the extent that it is impracticable for the Contractor to use the facilities in its commercial work, and if the costs are not charged to the contract through overhead or otherwise depreciated; (3) Costs incurred for the assembly, training, and transportation to and from the job site of a specialized work force; and (4) Costs not amortized solely because the cancellation had precluded anticipated benefits of Contractor or subcontractor learning. (g) The claim shall not include-(1) Labor, material, or other expenses incurred by the Contractor or subcontractors for performance of the canceled work; (2) Any cost already paid to the Contractor; (3) Anticipated profit or unearned fee on the canceled work; or (4) For service contracts, the remaining useful commercial life of facilities. "Useful commercial life" means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than their physical life with due consideration given to such factors as location of facilities, their specialized nature, and obsolescence. (h) This contract may include an Option clause with the period for exercising the option limited to the date in the contract for notification that funds are available for the next succeeding program year. If so, the Contractor agrees not to include in option quantities any costs of a startup or nonrecurring nature that have been fully set forth in the contract. The Contractor further agrees that the option quantities will reflect only those recurring costs and a reasonable profit or fee

(i) Quantities added to the original contract through the Option clause of this contract shall be included in the quantity canceled for the purpose of computing allowable cancellation charges. (End of Clause) B. 4 3452.232-71 INCREMENTAL FUNDING (AUG 1987)

(a) Sufficient funds are not presently available to cover the total cost of the complete project described in this solicitation. However, it is the Government's intention to negotiate and award a contract using the incremental funding concepts described in the clause titled "Limitation of Funds" in FAR 52.232-22. Under that clause, which will be included in the resultant contract, initial funds will be obligated under the contract to cover an estimated base performance period. Additional funds are intended to be allotted to the contract by contract modification, up to and including the full estimated cost of the entire period of performance. This intent notwithstanding, the Government will not be obligated to reimburse the contractor for cost incurred in excess of the periodic allotments, nor will the contractor be obligated to perform in excess of the amount allotted. (b) The Limitation of Cost clause in FAR 52.232-20 shall supersede the Limitation of Funds clause in the event the contract becomes fully funded. (End of provision)

The contractor shall: - Ensure that all non-U.S. citizen contractor employees are lawful permanent residents of the United States or have appropriate work authorization documents as required by the Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Immigration and Appeals, to work in the United States. - Ensure that no employees are assigned to High Risk designated positions prior to a completed preliminary screening. - Submit all required personnel security forms to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) within 24 hours of an assignment to a Department contract and ensure that the forms are complete. - Ensure that no contractor employee is placed in a higher risk position than that for which he or she was previously approved, without the approval of the Contracting Officer or his or her representative, the Department Personnel Security Officer, and the Computer Security Officer. - Ensure that all contractor employees occupying High Risk designated positions submit forms for reinvestigation every five (5) years for the duration of the contract or if there is a break in service to a Department contract of 365 days or more. - Report to the COR all instances of individuals seeking to obtain unauthorized access to any departmental IT system, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information. - Report to the COR any information that raises an issue as to whether a contractor employee's eligibility for continued employment or access to Department IT systems, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information, promotes the efficiency of the service or violates the public trust. Withdraw from consideration under the contract any employee receiving an unfavorable adjudication determination. - Officially notify each contractor employee if he or she will no longer work on a Department contract. - Abide by the requirements in Departmental Directive OM:5-101, "Contractor Employee Personnel Screenings." Further information including definitions of terms used in this clause and a list of required investigative forms for each risk designation are contained in Departmental Directive OM:5-101, "Contractor Employee Personnel Screenings." Failure to comply with the contractor personnel security requirements may result in a termination of the contract for default. H. 3 307-15 WITHHOLDING OF CONTRACT PAYMENTS - SECURITY (JUN 2006)

Notwithstanding any other payment provisions of this contract, failure of the contractor to submit required forms, responses or reports when due; failure to perform or deliver required work, supplies, or services; or, failure to meet any of the requirements of the contract, to include all requirements as specified in Clause 307-13 Department Security Requirements, will result in the withholding of payments under this contract in such amounts as the contracting officer deems appropriate, unless the failure arises out of causes beyond the control, and without the fault of negligence, of the contractor, as defined by the clause entitled "Excusable Delays or Default", as applicable. The Government shall promptly notify the contractor of its intention to withhold payment of any invoice or voucher submitted. Payment will be withheld until the failure is cured, a new delivery schedule is agreed upon, or payment is made as part of a termination settlement. H. 4 307-17 CONFLICT OF INTEREST (AUG 2007)

PAGE 12 OF 60

(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, has certified that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest), (or apparent conflict of interest) for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: 1. Unequal access to information - a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. 2. Biased ground rules - a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract, 3. Impaired objectivity - a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; - significant connections to teaching methodologies that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services; or - significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property or services. Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) of interest regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest), including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, Section 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government. The Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (D) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. (E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E). H. 5 307-19 REDACTED PROPOSALS (DECEMBER 1998)

The contractor shall provide a redacted copy of its successful technical proposal to the Contracting Officer within five (5) days after contract award. The redacted proposal shall be suitable for release by the Government under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

That is, an individual is prohibited from receiving double payment for any given period of work. H. 8 307-7a PUBLICATION AND AUDIO-VISUAL PRODUCTION (MAY 1997)

Except as provided below, neither the development or production of any publication or audiovisual product is authorized. In the event that development or production of any publication or audiovisual product subsequently becomes a contract requirement (expressed or implied), the contractor shall obtain approval in writing from the Contracting Officer. Until the contractor obtains such Contracting Officer approval, no costs for development or production of the publication or audiovisual product shall be allowable. The following items are excepted from the approval requirements of this clause: 1. Up to 50 copies of progress and final reports.

The Contractor shall ensure that any publication or audiovisual product developed or produced under this contract is compatible with the Department of Education's responsibilities under the Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,29 U.S.C. 794 and 794d, as amended, to ensure the accessibility of its programs and activities to individuals with disabilities. The contractor shall not distribute or release to the public any publication or audiovisual product developed or produced under this contract without written authorization of the Contracting Officer. To obtain this authorization, the contractor shall submit 2 copies of the publication or audiovisual product to the Contracting Officer. Since the Contracting Officer must obtain internal public affairs or other clearances, the Contractor should plan at least 45 days to obtain authorization from the Contracting Officer.

Payment to the GPO shall be made directly by the Department and charged to the Contract. H. 10 316-1 ACCESSIBILITY OF SOFTWARE (OCTOBER 1999)

The Department of Education (ED) considers universal accessibility to information a priority for all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities. Under Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d,as amended), ED must ensure the accessibility of its programs and activities, specifically its obligation to acquire and use accessible electronic and information technology. ED maintains the manual, "Requirements for Accessible Software Design," to convey the accessibility

needs of the Department to the developers and suppliers of computer applications. To comply with the provisions of this

clause, the contractor may use the edition of the ED manual

PAGE 14 OF 60

"Requirements for Accessible Software Design" in effect at the date of award of this contract or any more recent edition. A copy of the most recent edition of the manual may be found at http://www.ed.gov/fund/contract/apply/clibrary/software.html (a) Software delivered to or developed for ED--Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this clause, all software delivered to or developed for ED, under this contract, for use by ED's employees or external customers must meet all the requirements of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." However, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, the contracting officer may waive a particular requirement of the ED Manual, provided that ED's use of the software will meet the requirements of Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d, as amended). (b) Software enhanced or modified for ED--Any enhancements and other modifications, made under this contract to software for use by ED's employees or external customers, are subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this clause, regardless of where or how the software was first developed. Except as otherwise specified elsewhere in the contract schedule, the contractor is only required to ensure that enhancements or modifications (not other, preexisting features or components) of the software fully comply with the accessibility requirements of paragraph (a). However, the contractor is encouraged point out any preexisting features or components that do not meet accessibility requirements and to suggest solutions to ensure the software complies. (c) Waiver of requirements--It is recognized that new technologies may provide solutions that are not envisioned in or consistent with the provisions of the manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." Also, compliance with certain requirements of the manual may not be feasible for the particular software required. In such extraordinary circumstances, the contracting officer may grant a waiver, in writing, to any requirement of the manual or of this clause if it furthers a public interest of ED and will not significantly impair ED's ability to ensure accessibility of its programs and activities to all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities. To request a waiver, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing, listing the specific accessibility requirements that would not be met and explaining how the accessibility of a particular feature can be achieved by alternative means or why it is not feasible to make a feature of the software accessible. (d) Condition of payment--The contractor agrees that compliance with the provisions of this clause upon delivery of the software to ED is a condition of payment under this contract. H. 11 3452.227-70 PUBLICATION AND PUBLICITY (AUG 1987)

(End of Clause) I. 53 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (DEC 2008)

(a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have /_/ have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (C) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision. (D) Have /_/, have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has /_/ has not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and

PAGE 31 OF 60

similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of Clause) K. 8 307-17a CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (AUG 2007)

(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: 1. Unequal access to information # a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. 2. Biased ground rules # a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract, 3. Impaired objectivity # a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; - significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services; or - significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property or services. Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest

PAGE 38 OF 60

(or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause , the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, Section 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government. The Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (D) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. (E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E).

In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The Offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such Conflict of Interest (or apparent conflict of interest).

(a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have /_/ have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (C) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision. (D) Have /_/, have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,

PAGE 40 OF 60

this will

not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has /_/ has not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

sections L and M regarding past performance, is any subcontractor that is subcontracted for a minimum of 25% of the total contract amount. Each major subcontractor shall identify the name of the prime contractor on each of its past performance forms. If the offeror has no relevant

corporate or organizational past performance, the offeror may substitute past performance of a predecessor company or of the offeror's management or proposed key personnel who have relevant experience. A. Each offeror shall submit information about its most recent four contracts, completed in the last three years or currently in process, which are of similar size, scope, complexity or, in any way, are relevant to the effort required by this solicitation.

Request that the reference please return the completed form to the contracting officer by this date. Do not ask the reference to give you a copy of the completed form or any information therefrom. Beyond that initial request, you do not need to follow up with the reference; the contracting officer will contact the reference if necessary. F. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offerors' relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government will

(1)

PAGE 50 OF 60

focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. The "Contractor Performance Information" form identified in Section J will be used to collect this information.

L. 8 1997) 52.215-1 I INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION (JAN 2004)--ALTERNATE I (OCT

(a) "Definitions." As used in this provision-"Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. "In writing," "writing," or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. "Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) "Amendments to solicitations." If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) "Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals."

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral

PAGE 51 OF 60

proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals.

(7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer. (8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. (d) "Offer expiration date." Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) "Restriction on disclosure and use of data." Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall-(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed-in whole or in part-for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in connection with-the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) "Contract award." (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (f) (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to wh ether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other

PAGE 56 OF 60

ED will make an award to the Contractor whose offer conforms to the solicitation, has no deficiencies (as defined in FAR 15.301) and is most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered. For this requirement the results of the technical evaluation will outweigh the results of the price evaluation. As the technical merit (as determined by the technical evaluation) becomes more equal, the price will become a more significant factor. However, to be considered for an award, an offer must be fairly and reasonably priced. The contracting officer will determine whether any difference in technical merit is worth the difference in cost or price.

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M. 1 (A) 312-2 EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD (MAY 2004) The Government will make award to the responsible offeror(s)whose

offer conforms to the solicitation, has no deficiencies (as defined in FAR 15.001) and is most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered. For this solicitation, price will be a

substantial factor in source selection, however quality factors (including technical merit and past performance), considered together, are significantly more important than cost or price. The contracting officer will determine whether the difference in quality is worth the difference in cost or price.

(B) Past Performance 1. Each offeror's past performance will be evaluated based on the subfactors below. The past performance rating will be combined with the technical rating at a ratio of 36% past performance to technical to produce a combined quality rating. The relative importance of combined quality factors to cost or price is described in paragraph (A). 2. Past performance subfactors: a. Quality of Product or Service - compliance with contract requirements - accuracy of reports - appropriateness of personnel - technical excellence. b. Problem Resolution - anticipates and avoids or mitigates problems - satisfactorily overcomes or resolves problems prompt notification of problems - pro-active - effective contractor-recommended solutions. c. Cost Control - within budget - current, accurate and complete billings - costs properly allocated - unallowable costs not billed - relationship of negotiated costs to actual - cost efficiencies. d. Timeliness of Performance - meets interim milestones reliable - stays on schedule despite problems - responsive to technical direction - completes on time, including wrap-up and contract administration - no liquidated damages assessed. e. Business Relations - effective management - use of performance-based management techniques - business-like concern for the customer's interests - effective management and selection of subcontractors - effective small/small disadvantaged business subcontracting program reasonable/cooperative behavior - effective use of technology in management and communication - flexible - minimal staff turnover - maintains high employee morale - resolves disagreements without being unnecessarily litigious. f. Customer Service - understands and embraces service and program goals - team approach with the customer satisfaction of end users with the contractor's service - positive customer feedback - prompt responses - courteous interactions - effective escalations and referrals initiative and proactive improvements - creative service strategies. Bonus Rating--Where the offeror has demonstrated an exceptional performance level in any of the above six subfactors, the contracting officer may give additional consideration for that factor. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances when contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance level of "excellent." 3. Past performance evaluation will be based on information obtained from the awards and references listed in the offeror's proposal, other customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, and others who may have useful and relevant information. Information will also be considered regarding any major subcontractors, and key personnel records. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context

PAGE 58 OF 60

of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance will be considered. The contracting officer will give greater consideration to information about an offeror's past performance that the contracting officer considers either more reliable or more relevant to the effort required by this solicitation. 4. Evaluation of past performance may be quite subjective,based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.It will include consideration of the offeror's commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgement. 5. An offeror will be given an opportunity to discuss adverse past performance information, if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to comment on the information. The contracting officer may review recent contracts to ensure that corrective measures raised in discussions have been implemented.Prompt corrective action in an isolated instance might not outweigh an overall negative trend. 6. If no relevant information on past performance is available for an offeror, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably credit.

(C) Technical Evaluation Criteria: In accordance with the technical evaluation criteria, technical solutions that exceed any mandatory minimums will be given appropriate evaluation.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT 



SUPPORT FOR POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION STATISTICAL ANALYSES AND DATA COLLECTION





I.INTRODUCTION



A. Purpose



The U.S. Department of Education’s (ED), Institute of Education Sciences (IES) [National Center of Education Statistics (NCES)/Postsecondary Studies Division (PSD)] and Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) intend to award a 60 month contract to support postsecondary data collection and data analysis. The contract will provide support for the National Education Data Resource Center (NEDRC), Maintenance and Updating of the National Postsecondary Education Cooperative’s  Website (NPEC), a statistical report on the average cost per postsecondary completion by field of study,  and data collection for the Campus Crime Survey, Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act  Survey and School Accreditation List.



B. Background



Section 406 (b) of the General Education Provision Acts mandates that NCES

 

“Shall collect and disseminate statistics and other data related to education in the United States and in other nations. The Center shall... collect, collate, and from time to time, report full and complete statistics on the condition of education in the United States; conduct and publish reports on specialized analyses of the meaning and significance of such statistics. . .. 



In order to fulfill this mandate, NCES includes 4 major divisions, each of which is devoted to a specific area of education statistics. The divisions include the Postsecondary Studies Division (PSD), the Assessment Division (AD), the Elementary and Secondary Education Studies Division (ELSEC), and the International and Cross Cutting Studies Division (ICSD).  The Postsecondary Studies Division is responsible for postsecondary education data collection and analysis. The major data collections of PSD include  and the Postsecondary Sample Surveys. IPEDS consists of a series of surveys of all Title IV postsecondary institutions on topics including enrollment, institutional characteristics, institutional finance, student financial aid, human resources, graduation rates, and degree completions. The postsecondary sample surveys focus on individual student level surveys and include the following data collections: the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study (BPS), Baccalaureate and Beyond Study (B&B) and the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF).



In addition to collecting postsecondary data, the PSD is also responsible for disseminating and reporting on the condition of education in the United States. Part of this responsibility includes providing education information and analyses to the U.S. Department of Education officials; Congress; and State and local education agency officials on a quick turnaround basis. In order to fulfill this responsibility, the Postsecondary Studies Division has established the National Education Data Resource Center (NEDRC).  This contract will provide analytical and technical support for the NEDRC. 



In addition to the NEDRC, the PSD, houses the  (NPEC), whose mission is to "promote the quality, comparability and utility of postsecondary data and information that support policy development at the federal, state, and institution levels". NPEC fulfills this mission by establishing a research and development agenda to improve the quality of IPEDS data. This contract will provide support for the maintenance and updating of NPEC’s website. 



The PSD also disseminates data through their website . Using College Navigator students can search for information on postsecondary Title IV institutions. The information which students can access comes from IPEDS Surveys and OPE’s Campus Crime Survey, Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) Survey, and the Accredited Schools Data Base. The Campus Crime Survey is mandated by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, which requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to keep and disclose information about crime on and near their respective campuses and provide this data to the Department. The EADA Survey is mandated by Section 1092, Subchapter IV, Chapter 28 of Title 20 of the United States Code, which requires co-educational institutions of postsecondary education that participate in a Title IV, federal student financial assistance program, and have an intercollegiate athletic program, to annually report to the Department of Education statistics on athletic participation, staffing, and revenues and expenses, for men's and women's athletic teams. 



IPEDS Data is used to populate the sections of College Navigator that provide information on admissions, completions, enrollment, financial aid, and student retention and graduation rates. The Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act Survey populates the section of College Navigator which reports on what NCAA athletic teams each campus has and the number of men and women participating on each team, while the Campus Crime Survey provides statistics on the number of arrests and criminal offenses that have taken place on campus and in on-campus residence halls. Finally, the Accredited School Database provides information on College Navigator regarding what agencies provide accreditation to a postsecondary institution.  In addition, information from the Accredited Schools database is used to create the collection universe for IPEDS and the sampling frame for the postsecondary sample surveys. This contract will provide support for OPE’s three data collections which are used by PSD to populate College Navigator, to develop the sampling frame for the PSD sample surveys and create the IPEDS Universe.



In fulfilling its mandate to “conduct and publish reports on specialized analyses of the meaning and significance of such statistics”, the PSD publishes statistical reports relevant to postsecondary education. This contract includes the development of a statistical report which will examine the average cost of completing a postsecondary award by field of study. It will utilize data from the IPEDS surveys including the IPEDS Finance Survey, Completions Survey, and Student Financial Aid Survey. 




II. SCOPE OF WORK

Appendix A- IES/NCES Web Standards



All website developers should be familiar with these general standards before beginning any work on IES / NCES websites. Additional standards in Section 3 apply to the many pages on the IES / NCES websites that are served by data-driven, dynamic web applications (written in classic ASP or ASP.NET 2.0/3.5).

1.1 - File and Directory Standards 

Last revised: 04/20/2009 | 

Added source / sourcecode directory.

1.1.1 - Directory Structure Layout

In the interests of reducing maintenance and bringing about directory standardization to the IES / NCES website, individual program areas are directed to break down their web sections into a more manageable directory structure. At a minimum, separate folders must be provided for images, PDF files, data and include files. Any additional files requiring special access or handling should also be placed in their own subdirectory structure. Do not put any of these components inside the root and do not mix files within a subdirectory (e.g. PDFs with .asp pages). Additionally, the name NET should never be used as a folder name. It is used for other purposes in our environment and as such is a prohibited folder name. If your site does not follow this structure it will not be moved over to the production area. All DLLs need to be registered in the components directory through the Members site. The default naming convention is as follows: 

images - all GIF, JPG, PNG and SVG images. 

PDF - all PDF files 

inc - all classic ASP server side includes (note that include files ). 

css - Cascading Style Sheet (*.css) files. 

js - JavaScript / JScript (*.js) files. 

data - all downloadable components. These should be further broken out by: xls for Excel, ppt for PowerPoint, and zip for zip files. Word and text files are not acceptable formats for the website with the exception of text files for record layout documentation. 

dev - old or unused files (these will never appear on the IES / NCES production website) 

source or sourcecode - used for source code repositories when deployments involve precompiled code

The directory structure listed above may be repeated as needed in any subdirectories or other applications. For applications sharing a common set of files (e.g. CSS files, icons, etc.), a higher-level directory may be referenced (e.g. nces.ed.gov/css/ or /common/images/). 

Any files or directories that are not referenced by our website should be deleted or placed in the dev directory. If you choose to use Interdev or FrontPage to create web pages, you will notice creation of several three letter directories preceded by an underscore such as _vti and _ctf. In addition to these, files such as vssver.scc, and _notes which are created by applications but not needed to run web pages will not be moved over to the IES / NCES production web server and must be deleted from the development server before a request will be actioned.

Files and folders with the following extensions must never be used in production in any circumstances: 

dev or any variation of development 

old 

bak, or any variation of backup 

test 

copy 

notes 

ftp

If any of these are used they must remain in development. Requests that include such files intermingled with legitimate files will be rejected. 

Only necessary files should exist in your website's directories. Do NOT leave extraneous files or directories in your website. This includes temporary files and source control marker files.

 |  |  | 

Last revised: 08/03/2009

1.1.2 - File Naming Conventions

Keep all filenames in lower case. Make your filenames intuitive to the people who will be seeing them ("orgchart2000" rather than "oc2k") - this will help make your information easy to search for and find. Try to be descriptive in your file name, but not verbose. One word names are always best, but useless when cryptic. 

Most special characters are not supported in file names for the web on our servers. Web names (URLs) should be alphanumeric (letters and numbers). Examples of Special Characters not supported (this is not a complete list) include: (*) asterisks, (?) question marks, (!) exclamation point, and (@) at signs. 

More than one dot or period (.) in a filename is prohibited. This character should be reserved for offsetting the file extension (filename.asp). 

Spaces in filenames are prohibited. If you need to separate words in a file name, use underscore ( _ ) or dash ( - ) characters. 

As a rule use only letters, numbers and underscores. Anything else appearing in a request could be returned for renaming. 

DO NOT change file or directory names arbitrarily. Once a file is named it should retain that name when possible. This will result in broken links, as other parts of the site may be pointing to existing files.

Last revised before April 2009

1.1.3 - Website Default Document

A default document is the web page that is displayed when a browser request (URL) does not include a specific file name. The IES / NCES web servers search directories for the default document name Default.aspx for ASP.NET 2.0+ applications, and index.asp for all other applications. All IES / NCES websites must follow this convention. (e.g. http://ies.ed.gov displays http://ies.ed.gov/index.asp)

 |  |  | 

Last revised before April 2009

1.1.4 - Temporary Files

Many applications are developed for the NCES website that make use of the creation of temporary files. These files might include data tables or graphs. Regardless of the content for these temporary files they must all be stored in one central location in the IES/NCES web environment. A folder has been designated called tempfiles in which all temporary files must be stored. The path for these temporary files is off the root of the NCES website located at: /tempfiles/foldernameforyourapplication. You cannot place these tempfiles within the web share of a specific application. The tempfiles folder is automatically emptied out twice a day at 7:00 am and 7:00 pm. For help in setting this up please contact .

 |  |  | 

Last revised before April 2009

1.1.5 - File Attributes

IES Support will control and maintain file-level attributes for applications. Therefore, when modifying or uploading files, they MUST NOT be set to Read-only or Hidden. Also, do not enable any other of Windows' Advanced Attributes (Archive and Index / Compress or Encrypt attributes) for files. Beware of files copied from source control programs (e.g. Microsoft Visual Source Safe) as these may be set to Read-only when retrieved from source control databases.

 |  |  | 

Last revised before April 2009

1.1.6 - Supported File Types

Standard web content (HTML files, plain text files, JavaScript (.js), Cascading Style Sheets (.css) and images () are supported as well as . These other file types are also served and supported by the IES / NCES websites: 

Active Server Pages (.asp) - All ASP versions that are supported by Windows 2000 or Windows 2003 are allowed. 

ASP.NET (.aspx) - Standard ASP.NET 2.0 or 3.5 content is supported, including user controls, MasterPages and HTTP handlers (.ashx), as well as XML Web Services when they are not used for public serving of data (most approved web services are internal only). (.NET) Remoting is NOT currently used (but may be in future). 

Macromedia Flash (.swf) - Macromedia Flash is a standard for multimedia playback featuring vector-based images, keyframe animation, MP3-compressed audio, and a host of interactivity elements. The Flash client-side plug-in can perform streaming animation and audio playback. Flash media files are usually assigned the extension SWF and are stored on the server-side (similar to an embedded graphic). Flash can be used on the IES/NCES website after first securing approval from the NCES webmaster for any planned application. However, a non-flash alternative must accompany any flash application.
Note: When using Flash, the <object> must have a wmode parameter set to opaque and must also be embedded with the opaque parameter. i.e. 

<param name="wmode" value="opaque" />

<embed wmode="opaque" src="movie/movie.swf" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="0" height="0"></embed>

This is to prevent Flash objects overlaying over the top of any HTML content (such as the drop down navigation hover menus in the HFS). 

Microsoft Office (.xls, .doc, etc.) - Microsoft Office files are allowed. 

Binaries (.dll, .exe, .ocx) - With the exception of standard ASP.NET 2.0/3.5 DLLs, the NCES webmaster must approve all binaries deployed within a program area. Furthermore, these extensions must be separated into a Script subdirectory within a site, or, at the webmaster's discretion, moved to the global Script subdirectory. Full documentation (as well as source code) must be provided with the extension describing, at a minimum, what the extension does, why it is needed, and any necessary security precautions. Any custom ActiveX COM/DLL objects require testing on our development server before they can be registered on our web servers. 

XML and XSLT (.xsl) - small amounts of non-sensitive data may be stored as XML on the web server. XML Transformations performed using XSLT are permitted.

The following file types are NOT supported and may not be used: 

FrontPage and Interdev Extensions - These are not loaded on the production server and their use is prohibited. Configuration subdirectories (e.g. vti_cnf) will not be deployed into production websites. 

ColdFusion, Perl, Python, PHP, CGI - None of these technologies are supported on IES websites. 

Java Applets - For performance, accessibility and security reasons, Java Applets (or any applications requiring the user to have Java Virtual Machine installed) are not permitted on the website. (JavaScript is allowed.) 

VB Script Files (.vbs) - All VBScript must be incorporated into ASP pages (.asp). 

ASP.NET 1.x - The only versions of the .NET Framework supported are 2.0 or 3.5. No other versions will be installed on IES servers.

 |  |  | 

1.2 - HTML Composition 

Last revised: 08/6/2009 | 

Firefox 2 not longer supported. Statistics updated from WebTrends.

1.2.1 - Cross Browser Compatibility

All IES hosted web pages must be accessible, at a minimum, by the following web browsers: 

Internet Explorer version 6.0 and higher (Internet Explorer version 8 soon to be supported) 

Firefox 3.* (Firefox 2 no longer supported)

According to WebTrends, for the month of July 2009 the top browsers for visits to nces.ed.gov were: 

Internet Explorer 7 - 38% 

Firefox 3 - 22% 

Internet Explorer 6 - 13% 

Internet Explorer 8 - 11% 

Firefox 2 - 0.5% 

Safari - 0.3%

More recent statistics on browser usage are available at  for approved members, or see an overall trended history of the . 

To help achieve this: 

All website content should be XHTML 1.0 and use up-to-date widely supported standards, such as validated CSS - avoid using deprecated tags (e.g. <font> <center> <u> <strike>), keep all tags and attributes in lowercase, enclose all attributes in double quotes (e.g. nowrap="nowrap") and close all tags (e.g. <br/>). 

To convey emphasis in content, either use the <strong> and <em> tags or use a style (via a <span> tag, for example), instead of <b> and <i> tags. <b> and <i> tags convey only a visual style onscreen and while they may be useful for purely visual elements in certain applications, for general content on the IES / NCES website they should not be used. 

Check client-side (JavaScript) functionality - never use browser specific JavaScript. For example, use document.getElementById instead of document.all, which is only supported by IE; never use the const keyword, which is Mozilla-specific. 

Use existing stylesheets that have been tested for cross browser compatibility. 

Use HTML tables for content requiring tabular layouts, and <div> tags with CSS for other layout only where practical. In many cases, <div> tags may not be practical for layout, especially for cross browser compatibility. Also, to comply with , pages should be readable without stylesheets. Using complex <div> layouts may make pages unreadable without stylesheets.

Make use of the  to validate your HTML, CSS and check for broken links.

Statistics updated.

1.2.2 - Screen Resolutions

The IES website is designed for a minimum screen resolution of 800 by 600 pixels, which is large enough to cover the vast majority of users. 

Screen resolution statistics for users of the NCES home page as of April 2009 are: 

1024 x 768 38.4% 

1280 x 800 18.23% 

1280 x 1024 17.04% 

1440 x 900 6.52% 

800 x 600 5.05% 

1680 x 1050 4.25% 

1152 x 864 3.07%

Horizontal scrolling should not be necessary to view pages at this resolution. Table should not have absolute widths. By default, page widths are set by IES global style sheets. (They do not exceed 750 pixels.) This will ensure no horizontal scrolling occurs. 

It is not a good idea to have several pages of text on a single web page that forces the user to scroll and scroll and scroll some more. However, if you find that you do have several pages of text then they should be organized in a logical manner with a contents area that provides headings, links to text (or graphics or data) and a "Top" button following each section. This will permit the user to go directly to their area of interest and then return to the table of contents to continue with their selection. An example of this can be found at: .

1.2.3 - HTML Editors

While IES does not prohibit using any particular HTML editor for creating web pages, it is important to note that no custom FrontPage, Interdev, DreamWeaver, etc. objects nor extensions (such as Search, ImageMap, etc.) will be supported on our site. In addition, you may find that these tools generate extraneous folders such as vti_*. If you are using one of these editors you must remove such folders from the IES development server. See  for a list of allowed files. Some programs used to create or edit HTML (e.g. Microsoft Word, some WYSIWYG editors) will also generate a lot of extraneous code. Beware of these. 

An HTML editor that we have found to produce "clean" code is Macromedia HomeSite. You may also use any text-based editor that generates "clean" code.

Note: For ASP.NET 2.0+ web applications, Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or later is recommended.

 |  |  | 

Last revised before April 2009

1.2.4 - DOCTYPE and Encoding Declarations

The first line of every HTML document must be a DOCTYPE declaration (document type declaration). This informs the validator which version of HTML you're using. DOCTYPEs are a key component of compliant web pages: your markup and CSS won't validate without them. The opening html tag should also have the correct XML namespace URL. For example, for a typical XHTML 1.0 Transitional document: 

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

, although pages may also be written in XHTML 1.0 Strict. Do not use Frameset DOCTYPEs unless necessary (see 1.2.7 on usage of Frames), and never use older DOCTYPEs (e.g. HTML 3.2).

You must also specify a specific character set in addition to the DOCTYPE. A simple technique to mitigate exposure to cross-site scripting attacks is to explicitly declare which character set should be used on your HTML page. If a character set is not explicitly defined, any character encoding may be used and due to the many variations of character encoding, it becomes very difficult to filter out unwanted characters. All IES web pages should use the 8-bit ASCII ISO-8859-1 character set, which would be specified by including this line: 

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">

Additional meta tags are used throughout IES websites for search purposes - see the section on  for details.

Last revised: 04/20/2009 | 

Tip added.

1.2.5 - Comments

Use HTML comments only when you need to see the comment in the output HTML. Do not leave comments in any content that is served to the client, especially HTML source. This includes notes, bits of server-side code, and other sensitive information such as user IDs, passwords, file paths, database locations, etc. Sensitive information should only be stored in appropriate server-side files - for example, ADO.NET database connection strings will be stored in web application configuration files. Basic comments in CSS files or JavaScript are allowed. 

Tip: When editing an asp/aspx file in Visual Studio, you can use the Ctrl-K, Ctrl-C keystroke combination to comment a block of text and by default it will use ASP instead of HTML comments.

1.2.6 - Pop-up Windows

The following rules apply to any pop-up windows you use: 

Pop-up windows must not include an address line for a URL. 

Pop-up windows must be set to open in the far upper left-hand corner of all browsers. For an example, see . This requirement fits with the IES standard of center-justified pages, especially for users who are not adept at moving and resizing windows. To create pop-ups that account for Netscape's and IE's varying JavaScript syntax, the screenx, screeny, top, and left parameters need to be included in the window.open statement as follows: 

window.open('testpage.htm','myExample6','width=200,height=200,screenX=0,screenY=0, top=0,left=0');

Using this syntax, Netscape will ignore the top and left parameters and look only at screenx and screeny. IE will do the opposite. 

A "close window" button must be included immediately after the last line of text in the pop-up window. 

DO NOT include the IES / NCES header or footer. 

The  MUST be included to prevent the pop-up from being included in site-wide searches. These pages should not be included in any search indexing. 

Include a mechanism to focus on the pop-up when it is loaded to ensure that the window is not lost behind other windows, for example: onload='self.focus();' in the <body> tag of the html page of the pop-up window. (Don't put this code in the <body> tag of the page that creates the pop-up window!) 

<body onload='self.focus();' vlink="#s0000FF" bgcolor="#sFFFFF4">

If you want the user to be able to print from that window, include a print option button.

1.2.7 - Frames

Designing web pages with frames enables the display of multiple scrollable panels on a single screen. Frames divide web pages into separate regions that can display content independently. However, frames present navigation and accessibility problems. They typically don't work as well on low-resolution screens because the content must be compressed into smaller frames and because they require multiple page loads, they can also increase download time. 

For these reasons the use of frames is not allowed on the IES website, unless there no other design option exists. These special exceptions must be approved during the pre-design phase by the NCES webmaster before any actual work is done. You may also be asked to provide an alternative accessible non-frames version, both as a default for browsers that do not support frames and as a prominent link users may choose from the frames version.

If a special exception is approved, you must provide context and orientation information to help users understand the elements. This includes: 

Title each frame to facilitate frame identification and navigation. For example, in HTML use the "title" attribute on FRAME elements. 

Describe the purpose of each frame and how each frame relates to another if it is not obvious from frame titles alone. For example, in HTML, use "longdesc," or a description link.

Added note about self-closing tags.

1.2.8 - XHTML DOCTYPE Standards

As of August 13, 2008 all pages on ies.ed.gov and nces.ed.gov were required to use XHTML 1.0 (Transitional or Strict) as their standard DOCTYPE (previously HTML 4.01 was acceptable). XHTML gives us better coding possibilities, enforces better coding practices, and increases platform compatibility. All pages must be tested and in working order in browsers in our . 

Below are the two doctypes you can choose from:

Transitional: 

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Strict: 

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

This code must be entered EXACTLY as it appears above. 
Note: In order to validate as XHTML you should also include the XML namespace attribute on your opening HTML tag: 

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

If you are familiar with working in HTML 4.01, changing to XHTML 1.0 may alter or break some visual aspects of some web pages, which will require minor changes to the html code and css styles. In most cases using XHTML instead of HTML will have no affect on the look or function of your web pages. Pages need not fully validate to XHTML 1.0, but they do need to render as expected.

Specific issues to look out for if you are unfamiliar with the XHTML DOCTYPE: 

Comment tags
Comment tags should be rendered as <!--Your Comment -->. Avoid using extraneous comments, and stick to comments that will help other developers identify key pieces of content. For instance, more than 41 dashes in a row, will break webpages in Firefox. 

Divs falling below content
If, on a columned page set with divs, the right column is falling beneath the left column, adjust the div sizes and test in all browsers (hint: avoid mixing set widths with percentage based widths). 

Empty tags
Tags should not be left empty, (i.e., if you need a blank cell in a table, <td></td>). All empty tags should have a non-breaking space inserted, (i.e., <td>&nbsp;</td>).

Suggested guidelines for developing valid XHTML pages: 

ALL documents must have a DOCTYPE declared before the opening <html> tag appears and the correct XML namespace URL (xmlns attribute) on the opening <html> tag. 

The most common characters that require escaping are &, < and >.Use &amp; instead of &. A common mistake is to have URLs with unescaped ampersands. e.g., 

<a href="foo.php?chapter=1&amp;section=2">Here & There</a>

instead of: <a href="foo.php?chapter=1&section=2">Here & There</a> 

Tags must be closed in the same order they are opened. 

<strong><em>text</em></strong>

instead of: <strong><em>text</strong></em> 

Also, block and inline elements must be correctly nested. e.g., 

<p><strong>text</strong></p>

instead of: <strong><p>text</p></strong> 

Do not omit tags that are required as part of the tag's definition. e.g., 

use <table><tr><td>content</td></tr></table>

instead of: <table><td>content</td></table> 

and

<ul><li>listitem</li><li>listitem 2</li></ul>

instead of: <li>listitem<li>listitem 2 

All tags and attributes must be lowercase e.g., 

<meta name="rating" content="General">

instead of: <META NAME="rating" CONTENT="General">. 

(Note: the DOCTYPE declaration is not a tag, and must be in uppercase.)

Attributes must always have a value, and the value must be in double quotes, not single quotes (or no marks at all). e.g., 

<input checked="checked" />

instead of: <input checked /> or <input checked='checked' /> or <input checked=checked /> 

All tags must be closed. This includes tags that are often left unclosed such as <img>, <input>, <link>, <br>, <hr>, <p>, <meta>, etc. 

e.g., <p>paragraph 1</p><p>paragraph 2</p>instead of
<p>paragraph 1<p>paragraph 2

In many cases you can use the self-closing tag format for to make it easier: e.g., 

<img src="test.jpg" height="32" width="32" alt=" " />

instead of: <img src="test.jpg" height="32" width="32" alt=" ">, and 

<br />

instead of: <br>. (Note: <br /> is preferred instead of <br/>.) 

Note: script and meta tags should never be self-closing, in order to avoid browser and search engine spider compatibility issues.

1.2.9 - Secure Sites

NCES supports 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryptionvia its two F5 Networks Big IP load balancing servers. To facilitate encryption and server authentication, valid certificates signed by a trusted certificate authority are required. NCES currently owns a VeriSign-issued certificate for the site surveys.nces.ed.gov. 

When the client browser is engaged in a secure connection, a small padlock symbol will be visible at the bottom of the browser window. Double-clicking (for Internet Explorer) or clicking (for Netscape) on the padlock will generate a dialog window containing information about the certificate used by the server for the purpose of encryption.

Alternatively, developers can place a seal on any page that is part of the secured site thereby prominently showing that the connection is encrypted and also providing a link to VeriSign's database containing information about the certificate used by the site. The code consists of two parts - a JavaScript part that generates the pop-up window with the certificate information and an HTML part that is inserted into the .ASP file at the location in which the seal should appear. Simply copy and paste the code below into the appropriate area of the .ASP file.

Use the following code to embed the Verisign logo for SURVEYS.NCES.ED.GOV 

<script src="https://seal.verisign.com/getseal?host_name=surveys.nces.ed.gov&size=S&use_flash=NO&use_transparent=NO"></script>

1.3 - Section 508 and Style Guidelines 

Section 508 regulations cover IT accessibility requirements for Federal agencies and have been in effect since June 2001. Essentially they require that information technology be equally usable by members of the public with and without disabilities as well as Federal employees with and without disabilities. For IES / NCES websites, this means that text labels and descriptors be provided for all graphics or graphical representations, amongst other considerations. 

In addition to Section 508 requirements, style guidelines are provided for IES / NCES websites' designs. With IES / NCES websites hosting over 23,000 static pages contained in approximately 75 major directories, these have been created to promote consistency and good design principles through all our websites and must be followed.

You are responsible for the pages on your website. Please check your pages for compliance (see specific details below in this section) and correct them before your next update request.

1.3.1 - Section 508 Technical Standards

These are the standards that apply to IES / NCES websites, taken from 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications of Section 508: - 

(a) A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content).
(b) Equivalent alternatives for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation.
(c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup.
(d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet.
(e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map.
(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape.
(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables.
(h) Table markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. Defining row and column headers, defining the scope attribute and using ID and header attributes, will make the tables 508 compliant.
(i) Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation.
(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz.
(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be provided to make a website comply with the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes.
(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology.
(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with §1194.21(a) through (l).
(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed online, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.
(o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links.
(p) When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required.

More information is available through the link to the Federal IT Accessibility Initiative at: 

, written for the Information Technology Technical Assistance and Training Center, funded in support of Section 508 by NIDRR and GSA at Georgia Institute of Technology, Center for Rehabilitation Technology, shows you how to make your web pages accessible and meet Section 508 standards.

Testing tools URL updated.

1.3.2 - Section 508 Tests

All web pages that are submitted for review should at a minimum pass certain tests. Visit  to find tools that analyze web pages for their accessibility to people with disabilities. 

The types of errors reported by tools vary, but the following items must be included or submisssions will be considered as failing Web accessibility requirements for people with disabilities by IES content review staff: 

Provide alternative text for all images 

Provide alternative text for all image map hot-spots 

Give each frame a title (frames should not be used on IES / NCES websites)

The  can also be used to help check your content. 

Sites should also be tested by a text reader such as JAWS.

1.3.3 - ALT and TITLE attributes

Note: Although ALT and TITLE are displayed here in capital letters they should always be written in lowercase throughout any HTML document, as with any HTML attribute. 

The ALT attribute is designed to be an alternative text description for images. It must be present for all image elements, Java applets, Flash files, video files, audio files, plug-ins etc. ALT attributes are essential for addressing accessibility issues and satisfying Section 508 requirements for users with disabilities. It may also convince those with their graphics turned off to load the image. The ALT attribute provides context for your images, especially when used for navigation bars, buttons, and other graphical navigational elements. ALT text is displayed instead of the image in text-based browsers like Lynx, and in place of the image if the image is not displayed in most regular browsers.

Use empty ALT attribute text to identify images such as decorative graphics with functional information: alt=" " (i.e., quote space quote - do not leave out the space!). Screen readers bypass this empty ALT, cutting down the aural clutter/confusion that a graphic-intensive page may otherwise generate. At the same time visual ALT attributes will 'pop' up, letting a user know where there are design element level graphics. This convention should be used for images that would otherwise be labeled: "left" or "right" or "spacer" or "border" or similar things. 

DO use an English language description such as "picture of boy", or "photo of Secretary Spellings at IES". 

DO use ALT text such as "go to What's New" instead of just "What's New" if the image represents a link. 

DO use, as a minimum, the title of the table or graph as the ALT image for an image that is a table or graph. 

DO limit the length of your ALT texts. If the text description is too long or complicated to go into an ALT attribute, consider first including the text in the page. If this is not feasible, include the text as a link - use both the longdesc attribute (with the longdesc text being the link) and append a descriptive link (a standard href) after the image as well (since the longdesc attribute is not supported by all screen readers and has no visual representation on most browsers). Using "D" links is not recommended. 

DO NOT use the file name of a graphic (e.g. horishort440.GIF) as its ALT text. 

DO NOT use generic words such as "table" or "graph" for a table or graph's ALT text. 

DO NOT use the ALT text as a pop-up tooltip for images. The TITLE attribute may be used instead (but note that it is up to a particular browser's interpretation of the W3C Specification on how the TITLE text is displayed). 

DO NOT use blank ALT text (alt="") in any situation.

The TITLE attribute may be used to include additional descriptive information for most structural HTML elements including links and images. Unlike the ALT attribute, it is not required. TITLE text is rendered as a popup tooltip in many browsers although this is not part of their specification, and may vary from browser-to-browser. They may also be read as page content keywords by search engine ranking algorithms.

1.3.4 - Colors

When designing web pages for the IES website you must use white as a body background color. No other body background colors may be used. This helps provide the IES website with a consistent look and feel. When users are on a site and the site changes drastically in terms of color (as well as other things) they no longer feel they are on the same site and they potentially get confused as to their current location. Non-white background colors make readability an issue, especially with certain computers and resolutions. 

The simplest approach to selecting a color scheme is to limit oneself to only 3 or 4 colors (in addition to black and white), using a primarily monochromatic scheme. Choose a base color for the main scheme and find one or two other shades of the same color family to tone with it. Determine whether the selected colors come from the yellows group (generally warmer colors) or the blues group (cooler colors). Make sure that the chosen shades contrast enough to be readable when used as text on top of another shade, or on white. Then select an accent color (as may be used for followed links) from the 'other' group of colors.

Also keep in mind that an estimated 7 to 10% of men have some form of color blindness. This can cause difficulties distinguishing between colors - commonly red and green (95% of color blind cases), or yellow and blue, and in rare cases an inability to perceive any colors at all. You are recommended to avoid foreground/background color combinations that would make the text hard to read for people with color blindness.

1.3.5 - Fonts

Do NOT use HTML <font> tags to set font properties (in fact, do not use them all). Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) should always be used for visual styles. 

Typeface: use a sans serif typeface, such as Helvetica, Arial, Univers or News Gothic, which is not condensed. Avoid the use of serif (e.g. Times New Roman), novelty (e.g. Old English Text), and display (e.g. Bodoni Poster) typefaces. 

Use medium or bold face type. 

Present body text in initial capitalization. Use all capital letters and italics in headlines only (OK for publication titles as well). Use underlining for links only. 

Aligning text to the left is preferable to center or right alignment. 

When using the CSS font-family property, specify several different fonts (we recommend at least 3) in the order you want them accessed in case a user's computer does not have them installed. List specific font family names first (e.g. arial, helvetica) and use a generic family name (sans-serif is recommended) as the last in your list.

Also note the following font size suggestions adapted from the : 

Do not specify the font size in pt, or other absolute length units. They render inconsistently across platforms and can't be resized by the browser. Only specify the font size for pages that need a fixed physical size (e.g. print media). 

Use relative length units such as percent or em, or, even better, set a base font-size for the document and use absolute size ([ xx-small | x-small | small | medium | large | x-large | xx-large ]) or relative size ([ larger | smaller ]) when defining the font size for a particular element within the document.

1.3.6 - Style Sheets

All newly developed and updated IES / NCES web pages must use our global style sheets, which will provide the correct positioning and styling of page content. All IES / NCES pages using the latest Header Footer Service (HFS) will automatically link to the correct basic style sheet (main.css). Existing style sheets other than the members site style sheets will be phased out: 

Well-written style sheets provide consistency and flexibility with a website's visual design, while adding support for DHTML and other web technologies and are typically cached by a client's browser, increasing performance. 

We encourage you to use your own style sheets in your applications, with the following rules: - 

Do NOT set global styles in your style sheets. That is, do not set styles for <a>, <p>, <div>, <input>, etc...
Don’t use: 

a, a:visited {
margin-top:6px;
margin-bottom:6px;
}

Instead, use classes: 

a.space, a.space:visited {
margin-top:6px;
margin-bottom:6px;
}

Style sheets must not interfere with the display and function of the standard IES / NCES header and footer rendered by the HFS. 

All pages must be tested to confirm that the style sheets do not cause display or functional errors in Internet Explorer 6+ and Mozilla Firefox. In addition, we reserve the right to require your pages to function correctly in Safari/Google Chrome and recommend you testing your pages in one of these browsers (display differences such as minor alignment issues will not be enforced for these).
Note: Section 508 requires that IES web pages must be laid out so they are readable without requiring any style sheets. 

All links to style sheets should be inside the <head> section of your XHTML document, not inside the <body> section. 

You may use one new style sheet of your own per new application, making sure that it does not overwrite any existing site styles. Try to use existing style sheets unless new styles are needed. Multiple applications may share the same style sheets. Do not use separate style sheets for single pages (use inline styles if they will be applied to only one page).

Requests pertaining to content that breaks these rules may not be approved. These rules apply to all newly developed, in-development, or updated web content.

To help you create functional and effective style sheets that adhere to the above rules and are consistent with the IES/NCES websites, we recommend the following guidelines when creating and using style sheets in your web pages: - 

Use <div> tags to lay out your pages as opposed to using tables. Tables should be used for tabular information, not to line up to columns of text. 

Avoid specifically underlining any text. Links and only links should be displayed with underlines. 

Use a consistent naming convention for your CSS classes. In new applications try using a prefix to differentiate your styles from other applications, such as: .dasTitle, .dasBodytext, etc. Do not use "ies" or "hfs" as prefixes, as these are reserved for IES / NCES class names. 

Use ID tags for programming purposes only, not in place of a class. IDs should be unique and therefore used for elements that will appear once on a page.

1.3.7 - Usability Testing

In addition to , usability tests are useful for all websites - and major new applications in particular. It is virtually impossible to tell how users will react to websites without having them try to perform what is expected of them. One type of usability test that is currently popular is conducted in a fully functional lab environment with a live site. For each test six to eight users who fit the target population for the website are found. Once the users are found they come to the lab individually and perform a series of tasks with the website. The ability of the website to allow users to easily find them and quickly perform a task is observed and measured. Some of the variables measured are speed to complete a task and accuracy of task completion. The user's overall opinion of the site is also recorded. Issues from each task attempted are recorded and recommendations for addressing these issues are made. IES/NCES has access to a usability lab at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you would like to arrange for its use please contact  (202) 502-7498.

1.4 - Content Composition 

This section covers the authoring and updating of general web content (especially HTML and multimedia).  for web publications are also available on the Members site. For additional rules and standards specific to sections of the IES websites (e.g. surveys, publications and tables), see . For additional rules governing ASP conventions, please see .

Last revised: 04/20/2009

1.4.1 - Header and Footer

IES has an established standard header and footer that must be included on all pages of the IES website. The header and footer identify all sections of the websites as part of IES and provide common, central points for site navigation and key website features, such as headlines and NewsFlash. All pages on the IES site must include both the IES header and footer, except those designed to open in pop-up windows. Do not include the header or footer in any pages designed to open in pop-up windows. Additionally, neither the header nor footer should be placed within a table, nor wrapped within a container table or div. 

The header and footer are rendered using an internal web service, the Header Footer Service (HFS) which is available on both development and production. The HFS provides rendered HTML for both the header and footer, including stylesheet links and menu navigation specific to any IES site (including all centers).

To use the HFS on a classic ASP page: 

Insert the following line after the <body> tag: 

<!--#include virtual="/inc/header_inc.asp"-->

Insert the following line before the </body> closing tag: 

<!--#include virtual="/inc/footer_inc.asp"-->

DO NOT nest these includes inside another include. They must be placed directly into your ASP page. (A variable declared in the header is filled in a single web service call and then used again in the footer.) 

Note: The referenced paths shown above will vary depending on where your application is hosted. IES websites and NCES websites, for example, have slightly different header and footer files.

For ASP.NET 2.0+ applications, you can call the web service directly either from each page, or preferably from a single point (such as a Master Page or base page). To call the web service you will need a reference to the assembly  which is in the GAC (Global Assembly Cache) on development and production web servers. To do this, in your application's configuration file, under <system.web> => <compilation> => <assemblies> you will need the following <add assembly="IES.Common, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=66430E5E5C9741E3"/>. (In future we may make this reference a default for all ASP.NET applications.) In your code you can then populate the following Master Page front-end example: 

<head id="hd" runat="server"><!-- whatever head HTML --></head><body runat="server" id="bodyMain"><%=htmlHeader%><asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID="cphMain" runat="server" /><%=htmlFooter%></body>

with the following code (C# shown) 

protected new void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)

{

  base.Page_Load(sender, e);

  if (!IsPostBack)

  {

    HFSReader hfsr = new HFSReader("internalws/HFS", SiteHF.NCES, "<http://nces.ed.gov/someurl>");

    Literal litHead = new Literal();

    litHead.Text = hfsr.htmlHead;

    hd.Controls.Add(litHead);

    htmlHeader = hfsr.htmlHeader;

    htmlFooter = hfsr.htmlFooter;

  }

}

And the hfsr object will then by filled with the properties htmlHead, htmlHeader, htmlFooter which contain the HTML for the <head>, the header, and the footer. The internalws server is the IES/NCES internal web services server and will always resolve to the correct version of the HFS whether you are on development or production. SiteHF is an enumerated type specifying which website you are on and affects the stylesheets, menu, etc. pulled into the header (there is a value for each center, and for IES). The URL is the URL of the page calling the HFS and is used to determine whether or not a menu item in the navigation should be highlighted (you can specify the same URL for all pages in your application, if suitable). 

Note: The HTML inside the <head> element is separate from the htmlHeader - this allows XHTML compliance for stylesheet includes, etc. (Classic ASP pages that call the HFS do not have this feature in order to comply with legacy page structures, and combine the <head> HTML with the htmlHeader.)

The HFS is available as a deployable package for development testing on your environment. For a copy of this package, or for more examples, details and troubleshooting on calling the HFS from ASP.NET, please contact .

1.4.2 - External Links

In accordance with OMB Circular A-130 Management of Federal Information Resources IES has established agency-wide linking policies. Foremost among this directive is the understanding to limit external linking to information or services necessary for the proper performance of IES' functions. All external links must be reviewed periodically to ensure that they remain active or otherwise continue to provide the level of quality (including objectivity, utility and integrity) as intended by IES and expected by users. As such any external link needs to be approved after program staff determines its applicability. Make sure that offsite links are relevant and their review should be part of your standard maintenance procedures (check these links on a regular basis for changes). 

You must use a standard IES exit page to notify users when they are redirected out of the ed.gov domain via a link. To do this, add the target URL (minus the http://) to our transfer.asp file as a location variable, as in the following examples:

If linking to the Adobe Acrobat page you would type your anchor link as:

<a href="/transfer.asp?location=www.adobe.com">Site</a>

If linking to a secure site (using https://), you need to add another variable called "sec" and give it a "true" value:

<a href="/transfer.asp?sec=true&location=www.secure.com">Secure</a>

If linking to a ftp site, you need to add another variable called "ftp" and give it a "true" value:

<a href="/transfer.asp?ftp=true&location=www.myftp.com">FTP Site</a>

If linking to a site and its URL contains variables, you need to change ampersands (&) to %26 as shown below:

<a href="/transfer.asp?location=www.site.com?val=A%26val2=B">Site</a>

1.4.3 - Internal Links

There are two ways to link internally - relative and absolute. A relative URL (e.g. "../ccd/") specifies one object, but doesn't say what server it's on or what protocol it uses. Those elements are assumed from the page the link was found on. An absolute URL (e.g. "http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/") tells the browser what protocol to use (http) and what server to find the object on (nces.ed.gov). Relative URLs are useful for situations where what you're linking to is part of the same logical site as the page you are linking from. Absolute URLs are useful, and necessary, for linking to outside sites or sites on a different server. 

If you build a site with absolute URLs where relative URLs would do, you end up limiting yourself to a more specific structure than necessary. If you have to move your site later, you will have to go through and recode all your links. You may also go up and down directories with relative links by using ".." to represent the directory above the current one. Going down a directory is done by specifying the directory name with no leading "/" . 

Note: Do NOT use "../" when .

The following rules apply to all IES internal links: 

All links should be coded as relative links. For example a link to IPEDS Cool should be /ipeds/cool/ and not http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cool. 

Links should not include the default document. For example a link to Fast Facts should be /fastfacts and not /fastfacts/index.asp 

There is no www in any IES website URL. Do not use www in any IES address.

Note: Absolute links may be used when they are dynamically generated by an application (for example ASP.NET 2.0+) as long as they do not enforce a specific structure.

1.4.5 - Images

The IES website supports graphics in GIF, JPEG, PNG and SVG formats. No BMP, TIF, PSD or other graphic formats will be accepted unless they are pre-approved and a case has been made as to why they are necessary. A catalog of  exists for image files. These must be used universally on the IES website (for both dissemination and for survey operations) by referencing the /icons folder off the root. DO NOT recreate these icons and DO NOT put them in folders that reside in your local shares. 

The following summary may help you decide when to use a particular image format: 

GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is a lossless method of compression. All that means is that when the program that creates a GIF squashes the original image down it takes care not to lose any data. It uses a simple substitution method of compression. The maximum compression available with a GIF therefore depends on the amount of repetition there is in an image. A flat color will compress well - sometimes even down to one tenth of the original file size - while a complex, non-repetitive image will fare worse, perhaps only saving 20% or so. The major limitation of GIF images is that they are limited to a palette of 256 colors or less.
GIFs are ideal for flat color objects, and natural images that contain a fairly narrow range of tones - such as icons. Since the basic palette of a GIF is 256 colors, GIFs are ill suited for handling complex colors and gradients: these nearly always appear banded no matter how carefully you adapt the image. (Try and steer clear of long gradients in general, as they tend to bring out the worst in people's monitors.) 

JPEGs are suited to displaying natural, complex images and support more than 256 colors. Unlike a GIF, a JPEG is always full 24-bit color, so on anything but a 24-bit monitor it will always be dithered by the browser. If you're fairly certain your target audience is 24-bit capable and quality is an issue, then go for a high quality JPEG every time. The images will be smaller than a GIF too. On the other hand, if quality isn't an issue but size is, then go for a lower quality JPEG, as it will be substantially smaller than the equivalent GIF. The trade-off is that you lose the control over the image that GIF gives you: it's less easy to specify colors and the quality can be dire.
JPEG is a lossy compression method. In other words, it eliminates parts of an image to save space. Depending on how much you want to compress the image the algorithm used by JPEG throws away the less significant part of the data (the smaller curves), which adds less to the overall "shape" of the image. Unlike GIF, you get a say in by how much you want to compress an image. However the lossy compression method can generate artifacts - unwanted effects such as false color and aliasing ("blockiness") - if not used carefully. 

PNG is an extensible file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many common uses of TIF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and true color images are supported, plus an optional alpha channel for transparency. Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits. As PNG files as lossless, they will tend to be larger files than an equivalent sized JPEG (but better quality). 

SVG is a platform for two-dimensional vector-based graphics. It has two parts: an XML-based file format and a programming API for graphical applications. Key features include shapes, text and embedded raster graphics, with many different painting styles. It supports scripting through languages such as ECMAScript and has comprehensive support for animation. SVG builds upon many other successful standards such as XML (SVG graphics are text-based and thus easy to create), JPEG and PNG for image formats, DOM for scripting and interactivity, SMIL for animation and CSS for styling. Not all browsers have native support for SVG.

Coding Requirements 

 must accompany images to make the image content available to users with text-only or screen-reading browsers. Where possible, it should express the exact same content as the image. At a minimum, the content of all images must be elaborated in the alternate text attribute of the imagetags.

Finally, the following attributes must be present for all images; img src and alt. It is highly recommended that you also use height and width (unless you are loading images from a database and the images are of varying sizes), for example: 

<img src="Edstats.gif" alt="National Center for Education Statistics Electronic Catalog Web Page." width="91" height="91">

This will help ensure that most browsers (and versions) will load images correctly and without any difficulty in the proper rendering of the web page. 

Image Optimization Tips for the Web

Images that contain many different colors and not a lot of text, like photographs, tend to work best as a JPEG. An image of this type tends not to compress very well as a GIF and doesn't look as good as the JPEG, mostly because of the GIF format's 256 color limit. The compression mechanics of a JPEG usually dictate that the more the image is compressed, the smaller the file and the greater the loss in overall quality. 

However, images that contain any combination of small text, graphs, tables, small photographs with few colors, large areas of a solid color (no gradients or lots of shading) such as a white background, will most likely work best as a GIF. The GIF format uses lossless compression method, so GIFs generally appear as sharp and clear as the original uncompressed image. To reduce the size of a GIF file, you can try reducing the number of colors in the GIF's pallet. Disabling image "dithering" can also help. Dithering substitutes colors that have been removed with scattered dots of other colors remaining. For instance, dithering can replace a single dark green color with scattered black and green dots to create a perceived dark green color. GIFs often rely on this technique to push the 256-color barrier to create more lifelike images. Adobe Photoshop has tools that allow, via an easy trial and error method, the production of images to best suit your need. The IES website also supports PNGs which more resemble GIFs than JPEGs (but tend to be larger files than GIFs).

All graphics and logos should be anti-aliased to avoid jagged outlines. Anti-aliasing is a graphic design technique that makes objects appear smooth as if they had been printed despite the low resolution of the computer monitor. GIFs generally benefit from this technique; JPEGs do not.

1.4.6 - Videos

The following standards should be used for all video files to be posted on the IES / NCES websites. 

Video frame size (i.e. 320x240) - 320x240 is fine 

Frames per seconds (i.e. 15 fps, 30 fps) - 15 fps will be fine 

Video codec: Spark or On2 VP6 (Flash Player 8 is required to watch On2 VP6) - Include a prompt that allows users without Flash Player 8 to download and install it 

Video/Audio data rate (kilobits per second) - Use 256 Kbps

All video files should be saved in a .flv format, which provides more flexibility for how we display video files. However, there are cases where .swf may be a better option. 

Closed captioning is required for Section 508 compliance. In the past, we have both embedded the captions and provided a transcript on the same webpage as the video. All of the video formats support embedded captioning, and the tools to do so are usually free - for example, MAGpie (http://ncam.wgbh.org/webaccess/magpie/) which supports multiple video formats.

Note: The Microsoft .asf video format is an old one, and Microsoft has been using .wmv for quite a few years. IES / NCES has used .wmv in the past (for the http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/timssvideo) but Macintosh users may not be able to view .wmv files. The QuickTime format .mov is most commonly used by Macs. Flash video (.swf or .flv) is the format of choice for multiple platforms as it is fully supported by PCs, Macs and Linux. The IES / NCES supported Flash Plug-in 6.0 or newer will allow users to view the videos.

1.4.7 - Unicode

NEVER include raw Unicode characters (glyphs) in IES websites. These may typically be inserted inadvertently when copying and pasting from Microsoft Word or Excel. When raw Unicode characters (for example daggers, mdashes, unicode quotes, etc.) are pasted into applications and asp pages, the data can potentially garble databases, crash applications, and cause pages to be saved incorrectly when used in certain environments or software tools (because of the legacy of 8-bit text ASCII representations in various programming languages and operating systems - many HTML authoring tools in particular are unable to deal with the details of text encodings). Furthermore, screen-readers typically cannot interpret characters when they are raw Unicode. To display Unicode characters, use either the name code (e.g. &dagger;) or number code (e.g. &#167;) - refer to this  for more.

1.4.8 - Linking to Staff Contact Information

The maintenance of correct contact information on all web pages is essential for any website. Use generic links whenever linking to an individual or staff from a specific survey or program area within NCES / IES is needed. For example, link to the  through the database rather than hard coding all of the information on a page. Likewise, link to  in the same way. Generic links will minimize maintenance of such links. Otherwise you will have to review pages constantly to make sure that namees, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, etc. are up-to-date.

1.5 - Search Engine Optimization 

You can increase the chance that web search engines (e.g. Google, Yahoo, MSN, etc.) will find your pages by tuning the information in your HTML (although sections will be mostly invisible to your visitors). All new and existing IES website pages should follow the following rules.

Last revised before April 2009

1.5.1 - Title Tags

Every web page must have a <title> tag that contains a brief description of the web page. At a minimum, this should include a product name (if applicable) and a description. Most search engines will recognize titles of up to 70 characters. 

The title tag for IES tables and figures should include the full name of the table as it appears on the table itself (these titles will often exceed 70 characters). For example, "Percentage of 15- through 24-year-olds who dropped out of grades 10-12 in the past year, percentage of 16- through 24-year-olds who were dropouts, and percentage of 18- through 24-year-olds who had completed high school, by race/ethnicity: October 2000." These title tags for tables and figures are essential for certain search capabilities within the IES website. However, under no circumstances should you exceed 200 characters for a title tag, as this may adversely affect certain browser functions such as 'Send Link To.'

In addition to being displayed by search engines, <title> tag content will also appear when your site is bookmarked (or placed into a favorites folder). Put the unique part of the description into the title tag first. If everything starts with IES, for example, then it will be difficult to tell by the title in search results if that resource is what a customer really wants. Some useful articles that discuss both the importance of title tags and how they should be constructed for maximum impact are:

1.5.2 - Meta Tags

Your pages will fall into one of the two following categories: 

Pages that should be indexed for site-wide searches (generally all content pages and all index pages) 

Pages that should not be indexed for site-wide searches, that is: - 

all pages that are part of a stepped process (e.g. Build a Table, IPEDS Cool, other data tools, Handbooks with search components) that have an index page and then several pages to work through to complete a search, except for the index page (which should be meta tagged normally) 

all survey pages (they fit the above criteria) 

all pop-up windows

Any page which does not fall in the second category falls in the first category and should be indexed using at least two kinds of <meta> tags: keywords and description. Search engines that support these tags will often use the keywords found on your pages as a method of categorizing your website based on the search engines indexing algorithms (proprietary algorithms which index your website in search engine databases). Therefore, choose keywords that are relevant to your site and avoid excessive repetition as many search engines will penalize your rankings for attempting to abuse their system. Focus on your main keywords and then elaborate further by using synonyms or other related words: search engines give greater priority to the earlier words in your description. 

Search engines that support <meta> tags will often display the description meta tag along with your title in their search results. However, because search engines display their results to a user in a limited space, fewer than 20 words are actually displayed. Therefore the first sentence of the description field should capture the attention of a user and the rest should be used to elaborate further. In any case, descriptions must be limited to 200 characters. See  or view the source of the  to see a current example.

Pages in the second category MUST use the following meta tag: 

<meta name="ROBOTS" content="NOINDEX">

This will prevent these other files from being included in site-wide searches. NEVER include keywords and description meta tags for these pages.

1.5.3 - Top of the Page

In addition to searching the Title and Meta Tags, search engines look for information at the top of web pages, which makes the text near the top especially important. If it makes sense with your layout, include any information such as the title, description, keywords, products, services, acronyms, etc. in visible text near the top of your web pages. 

Add alternate text to images, especially title graphics. Since search engines will search text in the top of your pages, the presence of graphics in that area can also have an important effect. Search engines cannot see or interpret graphics, so any content contained in them is lost to the searcher. At a minimum, the content of all images (such as title images) should be elaborated in the alternate text attribute of the image tags. Provide the  (these are also required for Section 508 compliance).

1.5.4 - Themes and Relationships for Web Pages

Some web pages at IES are essentially smaller websites within the IES site. The Education Finance Statistical Center and the Third International Mathematics and Science Study are two examples. For such websites, Title and Meta Tags should reflect that fact. A title tag might say: 

<title>Education Finance Statistical Center (EDFIN) Title I Information Page- funds for lower income or disadvantaged students</title>

This tag mentions the name of the site, the name of the page, and describes it. Unless there's a compelling reason to omit it, all EDFIN pages would be advised to mention Education Finance Statistical Center or EDFIN in their Title and Meta description Tags. Pages that are not part of distinct websites within the IES website should mention that they are part of the National Center for Education Statistics or IES.

IES/NCES Environment



2.1.1 - Systems Environment

All developers need to have a sound understanding of the  in both our development and production environments. IES operates on HP Proliant servers running Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server and Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition. All service packs and hot fixes are screened by the Department's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) before being deployed. Taking this process into consideration, IES/NCES strives to keep its servers as up-to-date as possible. 

Current service pack status: 

Windows 2003: Service Pack 2 

SQL Server 2005: Service Pack 3 

Windows 2000: Service Pack 4

All Windows 2003 web servers support Active Server Pages (ASP) 3.0 on Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0. All Windows 2003 web servers support Active Server Pages (ASP) 3.0 on Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0. Microsoft's .NET Framework 2.0 and 3.5 are installed on all web servers. SQL servers are currently running Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition.

Note: The IES/NCES environment is domain-based with two Windows 2003 Server Active Directory domain controllers. All IIS/SQL servers are part of this domain and all SQL servers are in a separate DMZ subnet. 

All ongoing development efforts on IES/NCES servers require access to the IES/NCES DMZ via a VPN connection. Once such a connection is established, access to the development servers is possible via their respective IP addresses.

Note: Servers can have multiple IP addresses! The IP address used to connect to a file share on a particular server is not necessarily the same IP address used to browse a website hosted on that server. For example, to access file shares on the development web server WDCKSTWEB20 the IP address 192.168.132.20 is used. To browse the development version of nces.ed.gov on that server the IP address 192.168.132.137 is used. 

Environment Concept: 



Note: IES / NCES webservers are load balanced. This has  for your web applications.
