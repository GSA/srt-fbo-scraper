Development of 3D Tip Shape Characterization and Reconstruction Software for CD-AFM Reference Metrology

I. BACKGROUND



The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks a contractor to design, develop, and write 3D tip shape characterization and
reconstruction software for a project NIST is engaged in with Sematech. This Statement of Work describes this software development.  The
objective of the work is to develop the capability to perform 3D tip shape reconstruction and tip characterization on critical dimension atomic
force microscopy (CD-AFM) tools in general, and the Veeco InSight 3DAFM platforms operated by SEMATECH and its member companies in particular.
The immediate product of the work will be software for 3D tip shape characterization and reconstruction.  This enables:

     1. Qualification/rejection of worn/damaged tips in 3D


     2.)  Acquisition of the 3D tip shape element to be used in reducing 3D feature distortion from tip-induced image “dilation”

     3.)  Display 3D tip, export tip shape parameters and tip shape data.

The primary goal of this project is the development of a system for 3D tip reconstruction which includes software to take image data from an AFM
and reconstruct the tip shape, and may also include the development of data acquisition procedures for acquiring appropriate input data for the
software.  The software may be based on the existing Dexel code already developed by NIST.  The Contractor shall carry out the design of the
software in collaboration with NIST, implement, write, and test the software, and act as a consultant in the development of the overall theory
and methodology of the characterization process including physical characterization samples.  NIST will supply the Contractor with necessary
instrument data for testing the software. The capability to perform 3D tip shape characterization on CD-AFM will serve as a precursor to
removing tip shape distortion from data obtained using the in-line tools (generally Veeco InSight and Veeco X3D automated AFMs) typically owned
and operated by semiconductor electronics manufacturers.

The CD-AFM is an in-line non-destructive dimensional reference metrology tool used to measure critical dimension and profile information by
scanning the surface with a flared AFM probe.  Because the measurement of the surface is made at the effective point of contact between the
probe and the surface, the shape of the probe distorts the measured image, leading to measurement inaccuracies.  CD-AFM systems used in-line
today possess the ability to characterize the shape of the tip by obtaining a 2D cross-section image measured along the metrology axis.  In the
InSight system, this is accomplished by scanning the tip across two commercial characterization standards (produced and sold by Team Nanotech
GmbH):  the IVPS and the IFSR.  The 2D cross-section can in turn be extracted from the data using off-line Tip Shape Extraction analysis
software included with Veeco’s Nanoscope software package.  This reproduces a much more accurate image of the object originally scanned.
However, the entire system is currently limited to 2D, both for the tip shape image and for the extraction software.  This limits its utility on
the 3D contours and gate structures which are increasingly important as measurement objects in modern manufacturing processes.

The long-term goal is to create a system of physical characterization structures (analogous to the IPVS and IFSR) and software (analogous to
Nanoscope’s Tip Qualification and Tip Shape Extraction analysis functions) that acquires the tip shape from the characterizer images, then
removes the tip shape from the image file of the feature of interest, thus reducing image distortion in three dimensions.  The tip must be
characterized as a 3D image, and the extraction software must remove the 3D image of the tip from the 3D image of the sample.  The completed
system must be compatible with the Veeco InSight 3D AFM currently installed at many semiconductor electronics manufacturing facilities.
Implementation of the completed system may require acquisition and installation of specific physical characterization artifacts, either by
purchase or by fabrication.

II. SCOPE OF WORK


The Contractor shall develop the software necessary to reconstruct a 3D image of the tip using data acquired by scanning  one  or  more  physical
characterization standards. This process entails 3D morphological erosion of the model-based shape of the characterizer  from  the  characterizer
image in order to obtain the tip shape.   This 3D morphological erosion process can also be used to extract (i.e.,  “erode”)  the  3D  tip  shape
from measurement data acquired by scanning features on 300 mm production wafers or other samples of interest.  Validation of the 3D tip shape  is
also critical to reducing the measurement uncertainty of the feature of interest.  Consequently, 3D tip shape reconstructions  will  be  compared
with orthogonal TEM micrographs acquired from Micro Star Technologies and/or SEMATECH.  Tip qualification parameters for the 3D  tip  shape  will
be direct output  from  this  SOW.   Because  of  the  tight  connections  required  between  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  physical
characterization artifacts, and the design and implementation of the software components, Contractor shall  also  act  as  a  consultant  on  the
design of the overall system, specifically working with NIST to help design and implement the overall characterization methodology, and  to  help
select or design any new characterization artifact(s) that are deemed to be required.

III. SPECIFIC TASKS

The Contractor shall provide all support for project oversight, equipment, administration and technical execution of this contract.  The
Contractor is responsible for maintaining accurate records of project activities.

Tasks:

   1. NIST will furnish the Contractor with example tip characterization data of the kind for which tip reconstruction is desired. Initially  the
      test data set will consist of 4 sets of 4 images as follows: The 4 images will be taken with the InSight AFM using a sample tip of interest
      (most likely Veeco CDR50C re-entrant probe), the same tip for all 4 images. One of the images will be from a  line  on  a  IVPS  or  NanoCD
      sample, with the line oriented along the y axis and fast-scan along the x axis (perpendicular to the line). The second will be of the  same
      sample, oriented this time along the x axis with fast scan along the y axis (again perpendicular to the line). The remaining  two  will  be
      from a MikroMasch TGX test sample oriented with its edges at approximately 45 degrees to the scan axis; one of these  two  images  will  be
      scanned with fast-scan axis left to right and the other with fast-scan axis top to bottom. The four sets will  consist  of  a  total  of  4
      repeats of this procedure, two repeats at each of two locations on the TGX test sample. These data will  be  used  by  the  Contractor  for
      software development. If upon analysis the Contractor determines that the data have shortcomings for the intended purpose,  the  Contractor
      shall consult with NIST concerning improved data acquisition procedures, and  the  above  iterated  with  agreed-upon  alterations  in  the
      procedure.

   2. Contractor shall produce a preliminary version of the software that reconstructs the 3D tip shape from the characterizer scan(s),  provides
      the reconstructed tip shape and tip qualification parameters, and provides visualization of the tip shape. This version  will  be  suitable
      for testing. The Contractor is expected to use the data from task 1 in testing and developing the software.  This software  is  anticipated
      to be based on the existing Dexel approach.  The input for the software will be Nanoscope data (DT2 format or agreed  alternative)  created
      by scanning the tip across the characterizer using the procedures defined in task 1.  The 3D tip shape reconstruction  and  its  extraction
      algorithms must be capable of modeling re-entrant probes (e.g., Veeco CDR50).  The software will also be compatible  with  non-flared  tips
      such as the Veeco CDP15.

   3. The Contractor shall produce a PowerPoint presentation describing the preliminary software’s methods and instructions for use.

   4. NIST expects Sematech to acquire new tip characterization data  sets  and  use  them  to  test  the  software.  Sematech  may  compare  the
      reconstructed tip shape to TEM images of the tip. NIST will provide to the Contractor feedback concerning performance of the  software.  If
      the software fails on any of these new data sets, the data sets will  be  provided  to  the  Contractor  who  will  correct  the  software.
      Contractor shall deliver final software that reconstructs the 3D tip shape from the characterizer scan(s).  The input file format  for  the
      software will be Nanoscope image files created by scanning the tip across the characterizer. The output file will be  in  an  ASCII  format
      that can be readily imported into Matlab or Excel. The 3D tip shape reconstruction  and  its  extraction  algorithms  will  be  capable  of
      modeling re-entrant probes from re-entrant characterizer profiles. The software will also be capable  of  modeling  conventional  tips  (no
      reentrancy).  Additional tip shape parameters for export will be tip vertical edge height, maximum overhang and tip effective length.   The
      data acquisition method is specified in task 1.

   5. Contractor shall provide documentation to NIST and Sematech on the usage procedures of the 3D  tip  reconstruction  software.  Sematech  is
      expected to use the Contractor’s documentation to write a full report on the project, which will include an  overview  of  the  development
      project, usage procedures for the characterizer and software, testing results from the  project,  and  all  the  instructions  that  Member
      Company staff would need to implement the finished system on their own CD-AFM platforms.  Contractor shall  review  Sematech’s  report  for
      factual accuracy prior to publication.

IV. DELIVERABLES AND DELIVERABLE DUE DATES
