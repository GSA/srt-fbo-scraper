SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS H.1 CONTRACT START UP The Contractor shall be prepared to perform all work set forth in Section C upon the effective date of the Contract. H.2 PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY The Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management, is the only agency that is authorized to modify, suspend, or terminate performance under this Contract. H.3 DISSEMINATION OF CONTRACT INFORMATION The Contractor shall not publish, permit to be published, or distribute information, oral or written, concerning the results or conclusions made pursuant to the performance of this contract, without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer. Two copies of any material proposed to be published or distributed shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer, and one copy to the COR. H.4 POST-AWARD EVALUATION OF CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE Contractor Performance Evaluations a. Interim and final evaluations of Contractor performance will be prepared on this contract in accordance with FAR 42.1502 and TAM 1242.1502. The final performance evaluations will be prepared at the time of completion of work. b. The Contractor can elect to review the evaluation and submit additional information or a rebuttal statement. The Contractor will be permitted 30 calendar days to respond. Contractor response is voluntary. If the Contractor does not respond within 30 days, the Government will presume that the Contractor has no comment. Any disagreement between the parties regarding an evaluation will be referred to an individual at a level above the Contracting Officer, whose decision is final. c. Copies of the evaluations, Contractor responses, and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the contract file, and may be used to support future award decisions. Federal Highway Administration utilizes the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to record and maintain past performance information. CPARS hosts a suite of web-enabled applications that are used to document Contractor performance information that is required by Federal Regulations.

Deployment of Performance-Based Technologies for Mechanistic-Empirical (ME) Pavement Design and Resource Responsible Materials Design DTFH61-13-R-00021 Page 25 of 63

The CPARS module assesses performance on contracts for Systems, Services, Information Technology, and Operations Support. The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) module assesses performance on Architect-Engineer contracts. The Construction Contractor Appraisal Support System (CCASS) module assesses performance on Construction contracts. CPARS reference material can be accessed at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/cparsfiles/cpars/refmatl.htm. The registration process requires the Contractor to identify an individual that will serve as a primary contact. This individual will be authorized access to the evaluation for review and comment. In addition, the Contractor is encouraged to identify a secondary contact in the event the primary contact is unavailable to process the evaluation within the required 30-day time period. After the FHWA Contract Specialist registers the contract in CPARS, the Contractor will receive a system generated e-mail notifying him/her that the contract is registered. A system generated e-mail will also provide the Contractor with a User ID if the person does not already have a CPARS User ID. Once a performance evaluation has been prepared and is ready for comment, the Contractor representative will receive a system generated e-mail notification that the performance evaluation is electronically available for review and comment. The Contractor representative will receive an automated e-mail whenever an assessment is completed and can subsequently retrieve the completed assessment from CPARS. Contractors may access evaluations at www.cpars.csd.disa.mil for review and comment in CPARS. (End of clause) H.5 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED OR ACQUIRED PROPERTY Equipment provided by the Government or acquired by the Contractor for the performance of work under this contract shall be maintained and accounted for in accordance with the provisions of FAR Part 45. At the conclusion of the contract, all equipment provided by the Government to the Contractor shall be returned to the Government in the same condition as when provided to the Contractor, less normal wear and tear. The Contractor is responsible for transporting all equipment to FHWA at the conclusion of the contract.

It is understood and agreed that the Contractor and/or Contractor's employees and subcontractors: (1) Shall perform the services specified herein as independent Contractors, not as employees of the government; (2) Shall be responsible for their own management and administration of the work required and bear sole responsibility for complying with any and all technical, schedule, or financial requirements or constraints attendant to the performance of this contract; (3) Shall be free from supervision or control by any government employee with respect to the manner or method of performance of the services specified; but (4) Shall, pursuant to the government's right and obligation to inspect, accept or reject the work, comply with such general direction of the Contracting Officer, or the duly authorized representative of the Contracting Officer, as is necessary to ensure accomplishment of the contract objectives. H. 8 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT (SAM) The System for Award Management (SAM) replaced CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS. If you have been using those systems, you should now go to www.sam.gov to find your information. SAM is online. Your CCR username will not work in SAM. You will need a new SAM User Account to register or update your entity records. If you had an active record in CCR, you have an active record in SAM. You do not need to do anything in SAM at this time, unless a change in your business circumstances requires updates to your Entity record(s) in order for you to be paid or to receive an award or you need to renew your Entity(s) registration prior to its expiration. SAM will send notifications to the registered user via email 60, 30, and 15 days prior to expiration of the Entity's record. To update or renew your Entity records(s) in SAM you will need to create a SAM User Account and link it to your migrated Entity records. Training tools are available on the SAM website to help you get familiar with SAM. Start by going to www.sam.gov, and then click on the SAM HELP tab. Under User Help you will find the full User Guide as well as Quick Start Guides and Helpful Hints that will help you create an account, migrate your roles, perform updates, and search for the information you need.

H.9 REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTING SECTION 508 STANDARDS The following applies to all FHWA Contracts issued on or after June 25, 2001, for Preparation of Technical reports or other documents that FHWA plans to post on a website. In addition to the work requirements specified in this statement of work, vendors must ensure that all electronic documents that they prepare will meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The act requires that all electronic products prepared for the Federal Government be accessible to persons with disabilities, including those with vision, hearing, cognitive, and mobility impairments. Vendors can view Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (http://www.accessboard.gov/508.htm) and the Federal IT Accessibility Initiative (Home Page) (http://section508.gov/) for detailed information. Applicable Standards The following standards have been determined to be applicable to this contract: ____X__1194.21 Software applications and operating systems. ____X_1194.22 Web-based intranet and Internet information and applications. _______1194.23 Telecommunications products. _______1194.24 Video and multimedia products. _______1194.25 Self contained closed products. _______1194.26 Desktop and portable computers. The FHWA has determined that the accessibility requirements contained in the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards, Section 1194.22, "Web-based intranet and internet information and applications," and Section 1194.24, "Video and Multi-media products," apply to this work. The standards are available at www.accessboard.gov/sec508/508standards.htm. The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology device, but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and devices so that it can be made accessible, if so required by the agency, in the future. The following paragraphs summarize the requirements for preparing FHWA reports in conformance with Section 508 for eventual posting by FHWA to an FHWA-sponsored website. If you have further questions, please contact the FHWA Contracting Officer's Representative listed in this statement of work. Electronic documents with images:

Deployment of Performance-Based Technologies for Mechanistic-Empirical (ME) Pavement Design and Resource Responsible Materials Design DTFH61-13-R-00021 Page 28 of 63

Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element in all publications prepared in electronic format. Use descriptions (such as, "alt" and "longdesc") for all non-text images or place them in element content. For all documents prepared, vendors must prepare one standard HTML format (as described in this statement of work) AND one text format that includes descriptions for all non-text images. "Text equivalent" means text sufficient to reasonably describe the image. For example, an image that is merely decorative requires only a very brief "text equivalent" description. However, if the image conveys information that is important to the content of the report, then text sufficient to reasonably describe that image and its purpose within the context of the report must be provided. Electronic documents with complex charts or data tables: When preparing tables that are heavily designed, provide adequate alternate information so that assistive technologies can read them out. Identify row and column headers for data tables. Provide the information in a non-linear form. Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. Electronic documents with forms: When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues. H. 10 DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST It is the Department of Transportation's (DOT) policy to award contracts to only those Offerors whose objectivity is not impaired because of any related past, present, or planned interest, financial or otherwise, in organizations regulated by DOT or in organizations whose interests may be substantially affected by Departmental activities. Based on this policy: The Offerors shall provide a statement in its proposal that describes in a concise manner all past, present or planned organizational, financial, contractual or other interest(s) with an organization regulated by DOT, or with an organization whose interests may be substantially affected by Departmental activities, and which is related to the work under this solicitation. The interest(s) described shall include those of the proposer, its affiliates, proposed consultants, proposed subcontractors and key personnel of any of the above. Past interest shall be limited to within one year of the date of the Offerors technical proposal. Key personnel shall include any person owning more than 20% interest in the Offerors, and the Offerors corporate officers, its senior managers and any employee who is responsible for making a decision or taking an action on this contract where the decision or action can have an economic or other impact on the interests of a regulated or affected organization.

Deployment of Performance-Based Technologies for Mechanistic-Empirical (ME) Pavement Design and Resource Responsible Materials Design DTFH61-13-R-00021 Page 29 of 63

The Offerors shall describe in detail why it believes, in light of the interest(s) identified in (a) above, that performance of the proposed contract can be accomplished in an impartial and objective manner. In the absence of any relevant interest identified in (a) above, the Offerors shall submit in its proposal a statement certifying that to its best knowledge and belief no affiliation exists relevant to possible conflicts of interest. The Offerors must obtain the same information from potential Subcontractors prior to award of a subcontract. The CO will review the statement submitted and may require additional relevant information from the Offerors. All such information, and any other relevant information known to DOT, will be used to determine whether an award to the Offerors may create a conflict of interest. If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the CO may (1) disqualify the Offerors, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the Offerors and include appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded. The refusal to provide the disclosure or representation, or any additional information required, may result in disqualification of the Offerors for award. If nondisclosure or misrepresentation is discovered after award, the resulting contract may be terminated. If after award the Contractor discovers a conflict of interest with respect to the contract awarded as a result of this solicitation, which could not reasonably have been known prior to award, an immediate and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the CO. The disclosure shall include a full description of the conflict, a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate such conflict. The CO may, however, terminate the contract for convenience if he or she deems that termination is in the best interest of the Government. (End of provision) H.11 LIMITATION ON FUTURE CONTRACTING It is agreed by the parties of this contract that the Contractor will be restricted in its future contracting with FHWA to the manner described below. Except as specifically provided in this clause, the Contractor shall be free to compete for FHWA business on an equal basis with other companies. If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, is required to develop specifications or statements of work, or materials leading directly, predictably or without delay to a statement of work to be used in the competitive procurement of a system or services, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described within that solicitation as a prime Contractor, subcontractor, Consultant, or in any capacity to any supplier under an ensuing FHWA contract. Such restrictions shall remain in effect for one year following the date of the initial solicitation. (End of Section H)

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.1 GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR AWARD OF CONTRACTS General: The Government intends to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract as a result of this solicitation. The contract resulting from this solicitation will be to the responsible Offerors whose proposals represent the "best value" after evaluation. Under this solicitation, the "best value" will be made on the basis of the proposal meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. In other words, the "best value" will be made using a method in which when combined, Technical and Past Performance are significantly more important than Cost and allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or other than the highest technically acceptable rated Offeror. In making its selection decision, the Government will consider the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 1) Technical Factors as stated in Section M.2; 2) Cost and Business Evaluation; and 3) Past Performance Source Selection: Source selection will be made in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Department of Transportation Acquisition Regulation and this solicitation. Award of contract under this solicitation shall be made to an Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit or obligate the Government to the expenditure of public funds. No cost chargeable to the proposed contract can be incurred before receipt of a fully executed contract or specific written authorization from the Contracting Officer. Amendment or Cancellation of Solicitation: FHWA reserves the right to amend or cancel this solicitation as necessary to meet FHWA requirements. Communication: Until a formal notice of award is issued, no communication by the Government either written or oral shall be interpreted as a promise that an award will be made. Note(s): An Offeror should not assume that the Contracting Officer will independently obtain information necessary to evaluate its proposal and should therefore supply all information required to evaluate its proposal. Failure to provide the information required in order to evaluate a proposal could result in rejection of the proposal as being "technically unacceptable".
