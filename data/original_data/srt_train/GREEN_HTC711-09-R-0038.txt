Section C - Descriptions and Specifications CONTRACT LEVEL PWS CONTRACT LEVEL PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT ANALYSIS OF MOBILITY PLATFORM 22 Jun 2009 1.0 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES 1.1 Background. The Analysis of Mobility Platform (AMP) provides the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) with a modeling and simulation (M&S) environment for performing transportation analyses. Analysts use AMP to dynamically configure component interactions and integrate additional models in order to obtain an end-to-end simulation of the Defense Transportation System (DTS). AMP allows users to rapidly set up, tailor, and extend transportation and logistics models to support programmatic analysis, war games and exercises, execution, and costing functions. The current suite of models, the AMP Federation, includes the Model for Intertheater Deployment by Air and Sea (MIDAS), the Enhanced Logistics Intra-theater Support Tool (ELIST) and the Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD) Model. The APOD Model name is transitioning to Analysis of Mobility Platform Port Analysis Tool (AMP-PAT). The Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC), OS D, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands, CAA and USTRANSCOM and its Transportation Component Commands (TCCs) are the primary AMP Federation users. The APOD Model (AMP-PAT) is an analysis and decision support tool to assist Combatant Command planners, Joint Staff, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Center for Army Analysis (CAA), and USTRANSCOM analysts in refining transportation enabler requirements during Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD) development processes and to provide throughput analysis for airports and seaports. The APOD Model (AMP-PAT) is used to support throughput analysis in a stand-alone mode or as a federate of AMP, running dynamically with MIDAS and ELIST. The APOD Model (AMP-PAT) includes the following six tools: Airport Rapid Analysis Tool (ARAT) Airport Throughput Tool (ATT) Airport Simulation Tool (AST) Seaport Rapid Analysis Tool (SRAT) Seaport Throughput Tool (STT) Seaport Simulation Tool (SST) 1.2 Scope. The contractor shall plan for all general tasks identified in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) required to maintain, support and enhance AMP within the context of the AMP Federation of models. Note: Any reference to AMP within the document includes the APOD Model (AMP-PAT) Tool. Contractor estimates and timelines shall be determined based on the specific tasks and deliverable due dates specified in each individual task order (TO). The contractor shall coordinate with the AMP Program Manager (PM) to ensure that all activities are well synchronized and integrated with other USTRANSCOM M&S efforts, and that replicated or overlapping efforts do not occur. 1.3 General Tasks. Each TO shall exist within the scope of the following task areas. Specific tasks shall be specified and performed under individual TOs. Contract Management Studies Support Requirements Definition

HTC711-09-R-0038

The contractor also may be required to modify the AMP Federate and enhance the graphical user interfaces (GUI) and/or charts. In support of this requirement, the contractor may be required to define an approach to integrate the Federation, coordinate integration for the Federation, conduct integration and testing, and perform trouble-shooting to repair or modify software problems identified during model execution. 1.3.3 Task Area 3 - Requirements Definition. The Functional Manager will provide a prioritized list of functional requirements to the PM, who then will provide these requirements to the contractor. The contractor shall coordinate and integrate the technical expertise required to construct the system and associated databases (if applicable), and support field testing in a limited operational environment. To implement Federation-level requirements, the contractor may be required to coordinate with developers of other Federation systems as described in the Government-provided Memoranda of Agreement between AMP and these other systems. 1.3.4 Task Area 4 - Design and Development. The contractor shall design, develop, and test the AMP infrastructure and GUI to support Federation integration efforts. The design and development shall support future additions or changes to existing federate systems. Activities may include software development, software and system testing, and software releases. Commercial best practices appropriate to the AMP functional requirements shall be used to develop and test new system capabilities.

This block is checked to ensure that the minimally acceptable Electronic and Information Technology (E&IT) products are proposed. 4.10 Functional Performance Criteria. 1194.31 - Functional Performance Criteria 4.12 Standards. The AMP Federation is part of the JDDA-E. The JDDA-E consists of Conceptual, Prescriptive, and Transition Architectures, referred to collectively as the Enterprise Architecture (EA). The JDDA-E embodies the Distribution Process Owner`s (USTRANSCOM) Corporate Services Vision (CSV) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts. Current governance, policy, architecture, standards, and specification documentation can be obtained by coordinating with the AMP PMO. Other standards and specifications that are a part of the JDDA-E Prescriptive Architecture are being defined and will be made available after they are delivered. Until such time as the Prescriptive Architecture is released, existing federal, DOD, and USTRANSCOM guidelines shall pertain. The AMP contractor shall abide by the requirements of the DOD Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR) and the DOD Net-Centric environment as reflected in the JDDA-E. The contractor shall show traceability to the DTS Enterprise Architecture (EA) content to include identifying anticipated standards, new Information Exchange Requirements (IER), and system interfaces. This traceability shall be reflected in DODAF products for which the contractor shall be responsible to develop or update. DOD is implementing a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment to enhance net-centricity and data sharing within the Global Information Grid (GIG). As USTRANSCOM is in SOA discovery mode, the contractor shall consider SOA standards and protocols documented in the DISROnline and the Net-Centric Operations Warfare Reference Model (NCOW RM) during system development and enhancement. A SOA is a design style for building flexible, adaptable distributed-computing environments for the DOD. Service-oriented design is fundamentally

HTC711-09-R-0038

Page 16 of 65

about sharing and reusing functionality across diverse applications. Service-oriented design focuses on the following best practices: Make application and system functionality as accessible and reusable services. Expose service functionality through programmatic interfaces. Maintain an abstraction layer between service interfaces and service implementations. Describe service interfaces using standard metadata. Advertise and discover services using standard service registries. Communicate with services using standard protocols. USTRANSCOM's Data Management Strategy is documented in the Information Reference Model Manual which is the governing document for Enterprise Information Management within the Command. This document outlines program responsibility in support of the strategy. It mandates the creation and use of Standard Message Templates and Standard Reference Data (USTRANSCOM Reference Data Management - TRDM). The Enterprise Data Office (TC/J6-AD) will assist with the creation of the Standard Message Templates once validated through the Enterprise Requirements Management process. The AMP Contractor may be required to ensure AMP data is submitted and compliant with USTRANSCOM`s Distribution Process Interface Exchange Data Model (DPIEDM), and that no data business rule from that model is violated in the system, to include the database and interfaces. Software shall be developed in accordance with CMMI Level II best practices. 4.13 Small Business Commitment. If award is made to a large business, verification of subcontracting goals will be accomplished thru eSRS. If award is made to a small business, verification of subcontracting goals will be accomplished via a semi-annual report from contractor to the contracting officer. Report format will be determined at the post-award conference. A small business prime contractor may use their work performance to meet the small business commitment. 5.0 Security (Physical, Personnel, Information, Industrial, Anti-terrorism and Force Protection Requirements) 5.1 General Security Information. The overall classification of work associated with this PWS is at the SECRET level. Contract employees who support this contract and who work in a classified environment or work with or in a work area containing SECRET data shall require SECRET clearance eligibility and access. Personnel requiring security clearances must possess the clearance prior to beginning work on any classified information. The contractor shall not divulge any financial, planning, programming, or budgeting information without the express consent of the Government. The contract work associated with this PWS deals directly with systems supporting current operations and decision making for the DPO. A completed / signed DD 254 is attached to this PWS. 5.2 Contract employees will be required to access classified areas and systems at various locations that require SECRET eligibility. Contract employees with access to Information Assurance (IA) administrative privileges and/or who will monitor DoD IT systems or software as designated by DoD 8500.1 and 5200.2-R will be rated at ADP/IT-II level for this contract. 5.3 Contract employees assigned at the Non-Critical Sensitive/ADP II rating require an ANACI (or acceptable periodic reinvestigation) favorably adjudicated (a favorable adjudication grants eligibility at the SECRET level as prescribed by DoD 5200.2-R). The contractor shall ensure that individuals assigned have completed the appropriate forms. The required investigation will be completed prior to the assignment of individuals to sensitive duties associated with the positions. The ADP II rating requirement mandates the company awarded the contract have a minimum Facilities Clearance Level (FCL) rated at SECRET, which is outlined in section 5.5 of this PWS as directed in DoD 5220.22-M.

Interim FCL`s are acceptable provided they are not expired. FCL procedure s and security guidelines for adjudicative requirements are outlined in DoD 5220.22-M and DoD 5200.2-R. FCL`s and Interim FCL`s must be awarded by the Defense Security Service (DSS) or DISCO. USTRANSCOM will not sponsor the company awarded the contract for an FCL. The company awarded the contract must possess an interim or final FCL before the start of the contract. 5.6 Personnel assigned to this PWS who do not require access to classified material but will still work in support of this contract on the deliverables or who will require access to Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) applications and/or who will require Common Access Cards (CAC), must successfully complete a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) or suitable investigation meeting the NACI level or equivalent. Favorable NACI or equivalent investigation results must be posted in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). Before a CAC or NIPRNET access is issued the NACI must be opened and fingerprint and name check returned favorably. NACI submissions will be completed on the Standard Form (SF) 85P and submitted with fingerprint cards (FP 258) to USTRANSCOM Force Protection, Security Services Center (SSC). 5.7 Upon contract award, the contractor will submit all names of contract employees to the USTRANSCOM Security Services Center (SSC) for vetting through JPAS to ensure investigative and clearance requirements have been satisfied. This will be completed before the Contract Officer Representative (COR) / Trusted Agent (TA) accesses the DoD Contract Verification System (CVS) and submits requests for issuance of Common Access Cards (CAC) to the contract employees. If a contract employee does not have the required investigative or security clearance level, the contract employee will be denied the ability to work in support of this PWS, and the employee`s information will not be loaded into CVS. 5.8 Upon notification by the SSC that contract personnel meet the required investigative and clearance level, personnel will be loaded in CVS for an expiration on their CAC for the base year, plus two option years, for a three year total, if the contract is fully funded. If the contract is unfunded or funded on a yearly basis requiring recertification of funding by USTRANSCOM AQ or J8, CAC`s will only be loaded for the base contract or option year only. 5.9 Upon receipt of the CAC, permanently assigned contract employees located at USTRANSCOM at SAFB, IL, may obtain the AF 1199 (Restricted Area Badge) if the employee meets the requirements set forth in the SAFB Instruction 31-101.

Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. 2. The response shall consist of four (4) separate volumes: Part I ­ Past Performance; Part II ­ Task Order (TO) Performance Plan; Part III ­ Small Business Commitment; and Part IV ­ Price Proposal and Contract Documentation. To the greatest extent possible, each volume shall be written on a stand-alone basis so that its contents may be evaluated with a minimum of cross referencing to other volumes of the proposal. Information required for proposal evaluation which is not found in its designated volume will be assumed to have been omitted from the proposal. Cross-referencing within a proposal volume is permitted where its use would conserve space without impairing clarity. 3. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer`s opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness of the price.

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT

52.217-5

EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JUL 1990)

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (End of provision)

M-1. BASIS FOR AWARD A. BASIS FOR AWARD 1. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitations requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors to represent the best value to the Government. The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Government the greatest confidence that it will best meet or exceed the requirements affordably. This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the overall business approach and/or superior past performance of the higher priced offeror outweighs the cost difference. To arrive at a source selection decision, the SSA will make an integrated assessment based on the evaluation factors described below. a. Evaluation Factors i. Factor I: Past Performance ii. Factor II: Task Order (TO) Performance Plan iii. Factor III: Small Business Commitment iv. Factor IV: Price Proposal All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. In the non-cost factors Past Performance and TO Performance Plan are considered of equal importance. The Small Business Commitment factor will be evaluated on a go/no go basis. Proposals rated no go will not be awardable. 2. Factor Rating: a. FACTOR I ­ PAST PERFORMANCE: i. Past performance will be evaluated as a measure of the Government`s confidence in the offeror`s ability to successfully perform the requirements of the solicitation based on current and recent past performance efforts. The Government will consider past performance information identified by each offeror, as well as any additional past performance information obtained by the Government, in determining an overall past performance confidence assessment rating for each offeror. The term past performance, as used in this solicitation, includes both current and recent past performance.

HTC711-09-R-0038

Page 63 of 65

ii. The Government will begin its evaluation by first determining the recency and the relevancy of each past performance effort being evaluated. To be considered a recent effort, the effort must be currently on-going, or have been completed within three years of proposal submission. iii. The following definitions will be utilized to determine the relevancy of each past performance effort: Rating Highly Relevant (HR) Definition Past performance efforts in the specific performance areas identified in Section L involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities as those identified in the solicitation. Past performance efforts in the specific performance areas identified in Section L involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities as those identified in the solicitation. Past performance efforts in the specific performance areas identified in Section L involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities as those identified in the solicitation. Past performance efforts in the specific performance areas identified in Section L did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities as those identified in the solicitation.

Relevant (R)

Somewhat Relevant (SR)

Not Relevant (NR)

iv. After the Government has determined the recency of each past performance effort being evaluated, along with the relevancy of those efforts, one of the following overall Past Performance Confidence Assessment ratings will be assigned to each offeror: Rating High Confidence Significant Confidence Satisfactory Confidence Little Confidence No Confidence Neutral/Unknown Confidence Definition Based on the offeror`s performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror`s performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror`s performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror`s performance record, substantial doubt exists that the contractor will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror`s performance record, extreme doubt exists that the contractor will successfully perform the required effort No relevant performance record is identifiable

Note: If an offeror does not have any relevant past performance, that offeror will receive an overall Past Performance rating of Neutral/Unknown Confidence which will be considered neither favorably or unfavorably. v. Past Performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the prime offeror. vi. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contract deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP. vii. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Section L. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal ( for example, the relevance of past performance

HTC711-09-R-0038

Page 64 of 65

information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. b. FACTOR II ­ TO PERFORMANCE PLAN: i. The Government will evaluate for completeness and realism of responses and the intent to which the proposal ensures successful accomplishment of the PWS tasks. ii. Measures of merit for this factor are met when the offeror submits a sound plan for accomplishing the project within the required period of performance. The plan shall adequately identify all major project activities in logical order and realistic milestone dates. iii. Color/adjectival ratings will be used for rating this factor. Each offeror` s proposal will be given a color/adjectival rating using the measure of merit above. The color/adjectival rating depict how well the offeror`s proposal meets the measures of merit and solicitation requirements. TO Performance Plan shall be evaluated using the following color/adjectival ratings: Color Blue Rating Excellent Definition Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to USTRANSCOM; proposal must have one or more strengths and no weaknesses to receive a blue. Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements delineated in the Request for Proposal; proposal rated green must have no weaknesses but may have one or more strengths. Does not clearly meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements delineated in the Request for Proposal, but any such uncertainty is correctable. Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements; proposal has one or more weaknesses. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.

Green

Acceptable

Yellow

Marginal

Red

Unacceptable

Strengths are defined as a significant aspect of an offeror`s proposal that has merit and exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that is advantageous to the Government. Weaknesses are defined as a significant aspect of an offeror`s proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. iv. Proposal Risk. Proposal risk includes an assessment of the risks associated with a contractor`s proposed approach, weaknesses in the proposed approach, and weaknesses in the proposal itself. Proposal risk will be assessed for this factor. TO Performance Plan shall each be assigned one of the following proposal risk ratings: Risk Rating High Definition Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring. Can potentially cause disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties.

Moderate

HTC711-09-R-0038

Page 65 of 65

Low

Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties.

c. FACTOR III - SMALL BUSINESS COMMITMENT: Measures of merit for this factor are met when the Offeror: i. Provides a Small Business Commitment Statement which demonstrates a sound approach for utilizing small businesses into the Offeror`s approach and the level of small business commitment that they demonstrate. Offeror proposes small business subcontracting goals which meet or exceed all of the USTRANSCOM established small buisness subcontracting goals or provided supporting rationale; and ii. Provides evidence that established subcontracting goals for all small business categories were consistently met or exceeded under current or prior commercial or government contracts, or provided acceptable justification for not being able to consistently meet all goals. d. FACTOR IV - PRICE: i. Price/Cost will be evaluated but not rated. Each Offeror`s proposal will be evaluated as follows: (1) Completeness. Offerors` proposals will be reviewed to determine the extent to which the cost/pricing elements of the offer have been addressed. (2) The Government will conduct a price analysis to determine whether the proposed labor rates and Task Order prices are fair and reasonable. (3) Realism. The Government will conduct a price realism analysis to determine whether the specific elements of the proposal reflect a clear understanding of and sound approach to the requirements and are consistent with the unique methods of performance described in the offeror` proposal. When an offer is evaluated as unrealistically low, risks associated with this fact will be identified and considered in the evaluation of all areas of the Offeror`s proposal as deemed necessary by the Government. (4) The Government will consider the total evaluated cost/price of Task Order 0001 when making a best value decision.

The period of performance for this task order is 1 Oct 2009 to 30 Sep 2010. 4.6 Reserved. 4.7 Reserved. 4.8 Standards. The AMP Federation is part of the JDDA-E. The JDDA-E consists of Conceptual, Prescriptive, and Transition Architectures, referred to collectively as the Enterprise Architecture (EA). The JDDA-E embodies the Distribution Process Owner's (USTRANSCOM) Corporate Services Vision (CSV) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) concepts. Current governance, policy, architecture, standards, and specification documentation

Page 16

can be obtained by coordinating with the AMP PMO, who, in tum, will contact USTRANSCOM J6-A. Other standards and specifications that are a part of the JDDA-E Prescriptive Architecture are being defined and will be made available after they are delivered. Until such time as the Prescriptive Architecture is released, existing federal, DOD, and USTRANSCOM guidelines shall pertain. The AMP contractor shall abide by the requirements of the DOD Information Technology Standards Registry (DISR) and the DOD Net-Centric environment as reflected in the JDDA-E. The contractor shall show traceability to the DTS Enterprise Architecture (EA) content to include identifying anticipated standards, new Information Exchange Requirements (IER), and system interfaces. This traceability shall be reflected in DODAF products for which the contractor shall be responsible to develop or update. DOD is implementing a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment to enhance net-centricity and data sharing within the Global Information Grid (GIG). As USTRANSCOM is in SOA discovery mode, the contractor shall consider SOA standards and protocols documented in the DISR and the Net-Centric Operations Warfare Reference Model (NCOW RM) during system development and enhancement. A SOA is a design style for building flexible, adaptable distributed-computing environments for the DOD. Service-oriented design is fundamentally about sharing and reusing functionality across diverse applications. Service-oriented design focuses on the following best practices: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Make application and system functionality as accessible and reusable services. Expose service functionality through programmatic interfaces. Maintain an abstraction layer between service interfaces and service implementations. Describe service interfaces using standard metadata. Advertise and discover services using standard service registries. Communicate with services using standard protocols.

USTRANSCOM's Data Management Strategy is documented in the Information Reference Model Manual which is the governing document for Enterprise Information Management within the Command. This document outlines program responsibility in support of the strategy. It mandates the creation and use of Standard Message Templates and Standard Reference Data (USTRANSCOM Reference Data Management - TRDM). The Enterprise Data Office (TC/J6-AD) will assist with the creation of the Standard Message Templates once validated through the Enterprise Requirements Management process. The AMP Contractor shall ensure AMP data is submitted and compliant with USTRANSCOM's Distribution Process Interface Exchange Data Model (DPIEDM), and that no data business rule from that model is violated in the system, to include the database and interfaces. Software shall be developed in accordance with CMMI Level II.
