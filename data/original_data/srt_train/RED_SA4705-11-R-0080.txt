Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the Government Accountability Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protects filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979". (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the contracting officer).

If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.

The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.2331), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1).

PROPOSAL FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL (Addendum to FAR 52.212-1) 1.0 EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

The Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process will be used. A single award IDIQ contract will be made to the responsible offeror who meets all the technical factors, has acceptable past performance and results in the lowest price to the government. A. Technical Factors To be technically acceptable, each proposal must demonstrate it meets all of the Technical Factors set forth in attachment 1- Statement of Work. Offerors will note that in responding to attachment 1, they will be directed to additional documents in Microsoft Excel and Zip file formats, (which is an extension of the Statement of Work, for offeror responses). All responses to attachment 1 will be evaluated on a "pass" or "fail" basis. In order to receive a "pass" rating the quote must clearly demonstrate the contractor's ability to provide and perform all services and technical requirements described in the Statement of Work. A proposal that is evaluated as "fail" for any requirement will not be considered for award. B. Past Performance

A past performance review will be conducted to determine whether the Government has confidence that the offeror can successfully perform the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work. In conducting its past performance assessment the Government may use both data provided by the offeror and data obtained from other federal Government sources. Past performance will be determined on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. C. Price

Prices will be calculated on the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet labeled "Section B ­ Schedule of SuppliesServices". The result will be based on pricing entered by the offeror for supplies/services on all of the 10 tabs labeled from `Months 1-12 Matrix' to `Months 109-120 Matrix'. The corresponding totals from each Matrix tab are then brought together on the `Contract Total' tab by CLIN. Each offeror's total price, for analysis purposes, will be the total dollar figure in cell G68 of the `Contract Total' tab, described as `Estimated Contract Total with Option'.

Dr
2.0 Proposal Format: Each proposal shall consist of three (3) separate documents specifically named: "Part 1. Technical Requirements," "Part 2. Past Performance" and "Part 3. Price". The contents of each part are set forth below. No price information will be included in Parts 1 and/or 2. Proposals will be evaluated as set forth above in "Evaluation Factors for Award". Part 1. Technical Requirements: In Part 1, the offeror must demonstrate written compliance with ALL the Technical Requirements and subrequirements set forth in Attachment 1 - Statement of Work, parts 1.0 through 12.0, in written text format. The offeror shall provide a statement that they comply with each paragraph/sub-paragraph of the Statement of Work or provide any exceptions referencing the applicable paragraph/sub-paragraph. Note: In specific response to sub-paragraphs in section 1.0 (1.2 through 1.8), offerors may provide any necessary statements on the text document, but will specifically respond by filling out and returning in the same file format, the Microsoft Excel Attachment 1a- Equipment Specification Requirements. Offerors will propose specific equipment in response to the solicitation, and responds in the BLUE columns only. An instructions page is listed in the first tab of Attachment 1a.
