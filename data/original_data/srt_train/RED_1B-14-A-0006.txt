a. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C.7101-7109) ("the Act"or "CDA").

b. Except as provided in the Act, all disputes arising under or relating to this contract must be resolved under this clause.

c. "Claim," as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right,
the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this
contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the supplier seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under
the Act until certified as required by subparagraph d.2 below. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute
when submitted is not a claim under the Act. The submission may be converted to a claim under the Act by complying with the submission and
certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount is not acted upon in a reasonable time.

d.
(1) A claim by the supplier must be made in writing and submitted to the contracting officer for a written decision. A claim by the Postal
Service against the supplier is subject to a written decision by the contracting officer.

(2) For supplier claims exceeding $100,000, the supplier must submit with the claim the following certification:

"I certify that the claim is made in good faith, that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, that
the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the supplier believes the Postal Service is liable, and that I am
duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the supplier."

(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the supplier with respect to the claim.

e. For supplier claims of $100,000 or less, the contracting officer must, if requested in writing by the supplier, render a decision within 60
days of the request. For supplier-certified claims over $100,000, the contracting officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the
supplier of the date by which the decision will be made.

f. The contracting officer's decision is final unless the supplier appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.

g. When a CDA claim is submitted by or against a supplier, the parties by mutual consent may agree to use an alternative dispute resolution
(ADR) process to assist in resolving the claim. A certification as described in d(2) of this clause must be provided for any claim, regardless
of dollar amount, before ADR is used.

h. The Postal Service will pay interest in the amount found due and unpaid from:

(1) The date the contracting officer receives the claim (properly certified, if required); or

(2) The date payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment.

i. Simple interest on claims will be paid at a rate determined in accordance with the Interest clause.

j. The supplier must proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or
action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the contracting officer.

regulations at 39 CFR Parts 266-267 apply to those records. The supplier is considered to operate a system of records if it manages records
(including collecting, revising, or disseminating records) from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some number,
symbol, or other identifier assigned to the individual. The supplier agrees to comply with the Act and the Postal Service regulations in
designing, developing, and operating the system of records, including ensuring that records are current and accurate for their intended use, and
incorporating adequate safeguards to prevent misuse or improper disclosure of personal information. Violations of the Act may subject the

written approval of the contracting officer. The supplier must restrict access to such information to those employees who need the information
to perform work under this contract, and must ensure that each such employee




(including subcontractors' employees) sign a nondisclosure agreement, in a form suitable to the contracting officer, prior to being granted
access to the information. The Postal Service retains sole ownership and rights to its customer or employee information. Unless the contract
states otherwise, upon completion of the contract the supplier must turn over all Postal Service customer or employee information in its
possession to the Postal Service, and must certify that no Postal Service customer or employee information has been retained unless otherwise
authorized in writing by the contracting officer.
(3)  Security Plan.  When applicable, and unless waived in writing by the contracting officer, the supplier must work with the Postal Service to
develop and implement a security plan that addresses the protection of customer or employee information.  The plan will be incorporated into the
contract and followed by the supplier, and must, at a minimum, address notification to the Postal Service of any security breach. If the
contract does not include a security plan at the time of contract award, it must be added within 60 days after contract award.
(4)   Breach Notification.  If there is a breach of any nature in the security of Postal Service data, including customer or employee data, the
supplier must follow the breach notification requirements included in the security plan discussed in (3) above.  The supplier will be required
to follow Postal Service policies regarding breach notification to customers and/or employees.
(5) Legal Demands for Information. If a legal demand is made for Postal Service customer or employee information (such as by subpoena), the
supplier must immediately notify the contracting officer and the nearest office of the Postal Inspection Service. After notification, the Postal
Service will determine whether and to what extent to comply with the legal demand. Should the Postal Service agree to or unsuccessfully resist a
legal demand, the supplier may, with the written permission of the contracting officer, release the information specifically demanded.

the Postal Service and must adhere to the Postal Service policies set out in Postal Service Management Instruction AS-350-2004-4, Marketing E-
mail. Suppliers wishing to conduct marketing email campaigns to postal employees must first obtain the prior written approval of the contracting
officer.

compliance software.

f.  Indemnification. The supplier will indemnify the Postal Service against all liability (including costs and fees) for damages arising out of
violations of this clause.

g.  Flow-down. The supplier will flow this clause down to subcontractors that would be covered by any portion of this clause if they were the
supplier.


CLAUSE 1-7 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (MARCH 2006)




a. Warranty Against Existing Conflicts of Interest. The supplier warrants and represents that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, it does
not presently have organizational conflicts of interest that would diminish its capacity to provide impartial, technically sound, objective
research assistance or advice, or would result in a biased work product, or might result in an unfair competitive advantage, except for
advantages flowing from the normal benefits of performing this agreement.



b. Restrictions on Contracting. The supplier agrees that during the term of this agreement, any extensions thereto, and for a period of 2 years
thereafter, neither the supplier nor its affiliates will perform any of the following:

Service contract for production of any product for which the supplier prepared any work statement or specifications or conducted any studies or
performed any task under this agreement.

c. Possible Future Conflicts of Interest. The supplier agrees that, if after award of this agreement, it discovers any organizational conflict
of interest that would diminish its capacity to provide impartial, technically sound, objective research assistance or advice, or would result
in a biased work product, or might result in an unfair competitive advantage, except advantages flowing from the normal benefits of performing
this agreement, the supplier will make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer, including a description of the
action the supplier has taken or proposes to take to avoid, eliminate, or neutralize this conflict of interest.

d. Nondisclosure of Confidential Material

the information is confidential, the supplier agrees to take the steps necessary to prevent its disclosure to any third party without the prior
written consent of the contracting officer.

(2) The supplier agrees to indoctrinate its personnel who will have access to confidential information as to the confidential nature of the
information, and the relationship under which the supplier has possession of this information.

(3) The supplier agrees to limit access to the confidential information obtained, generated, or derived, and to limit participation in the
performance of orders under this agreement to those employees whose services are necessary for performing them.

e. Postal Service Remedy. If the supplier breaches or violates any of the warranties, covenants, restrictions, disclosures or nondisclosures set
forth under this clause, the Postal Service may terminate this agreement, in addition to any other remedy it may have for damages or injunctive

CLAUSE 1-11 PROHIBITION AGAINST CONTRACTING WITH FORMER OFFICERS OR PCES EXECUTIVES (MARCH 2006)




During the performance of this contract, former Postal officers or Postal Career Executive Service (PCES) executives are prohibited from

CLAUSE 1-12 USE OF FORMER POSTAL SERVICE EMPLOYEES (MARCH 2006)




During the term of this contract, the supplier must identify any former Postal Service employees it proposes to be engaged, directly or
indirectly, in contract performance. Such individuals may not commence performance without the contracting officer's prior approval. If the
contracting officer does not provide such approval, the supplier must replace the proposed individual former employee with another individual
equally qualified to provide the services called for in the contract.


CLAUSE 2-20 OPTION TO RENEW (WITH PRELIMINARY NOTICE) (MARCH 2006)




This contract is renewable, at the option of the Postal Service, by the contracting officer giving written notice of renewal to the supplier
within the period specified in the Schedule; provided that, the contracting officer will have given preliminary notice of the Postal Service's
intent to renew at least 60 days before this contract is to expire (such a preliminary notice will not be deemed to commit the Postal Service to
renewals). If the Postal Service exercises this option for renewal, the contract as renewed includes this option clause. The duration of this
contract, including renewals, may not exceed the time limit set forth in the Schedule.


CLAUSE 2-26 PAYMENT - FIXED PRICE (MARCH 2006)




The Postal Service will pay the supplier, upon the submission of proper invoices or vouchers, the prices stipulated in this contract for work or
supplies delivered and accepted or services rendered and accepted, less any deductions provided for by the contract. Unless the contract

a. The amount due on the deliveries warrants it; or

b. The supplier requests it and the amount due on the deliveries is at least $1,000 or 50 percent of the total contract price, whichever is
less.


CLAUSE 2-32 LIMITATION OF FUNDS (MARCH 2006)




a. The parties estimate that the cost to the Postal Service for performing this contract will not exceed the estimated cost set forth in the
Schedule, and the supplier agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract
within this estimated cost.

b. The amount presently available for payment and allotted to this contract, the items covered by this amount, and the period of performance it
is estimated the allotted amount will cover are specified in the Schedule. It is contemplated that from time to time additional funds will be
allotted to this contract up to the full estimated cost set forth in the Schedule, exclusive of any fee. The supplier agrees to perform or have
performed work on this contract up to the point at which the total amount paid and payable by the Postal Service under this contract
approximates but does not exceed the total actually allotted to the contract.

c. Whenever the supplier has reason to believe that the costs it expects to incur in performing this contract in the next succeeding 60 days,
when added to all costs previously incurred, will exceed 75 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract, the supplier must notify
the contracting officer in writing to that effect. The notice must state the estimated amount of additional funds required to continue
performance for the period set forth in the Schedule. No later than 60 days (see note 1) before the end of the period specified in the Schedule,
the supplier must advise the contracting officer in writing as to the estimated amount of additional funds, if any, that will be required for
the timely performance of the work under the contract or for such further period as may be specified in the Schedule or otherwise agreed to by
the parties, If, after this notification, additional funds are not allotted by the end of the period set forth in the Schedule or an agreed date
substituted therefore, the contracting officer will, upon written request by the supplier, terminate this contract on that date, under the
Termination clause. If the supplier, exercising reasonable judgment, estimates that the funds available will allow it to continue to discharge
its obligations for a period extending beyond that date, the supplier must specify the later date in the request, and the contracting officer,
in the contracting officer's discretion, may terminate the contract on that later date.

d. Except as required by other provisions of this contract specifically citing and stated to be an exception to this clause, the Postal Service
is not obligated to reimburse the supplier for costs incurred in excess of the total amount from time to time allotted to the contract, and the
supplier is not obligated to continue performance (including actions under the contract's Termination clause) or otherwise to incur costs in
excess of that amount, unless the contracting officer notifies the supplier in writing that the amount has been increased, specifying an
increased amount constituting the total amount then allotted to the contract. To the extent that the amount allotted exceeds the estimated cost
set forth in the Schedule, the estimated cost must be correspondingly increased. No notice, communication, or representation in any other form
or from any person other than the contracting officer may affect the amount allotted. In the absence of the specified notice, the Postal Service
is not obligated to reimburse the supplier for any costs in excess of the total amount then allotted, whether incurred during the course of the
contract or as a result of termination. To the extent that the amount allotted is increased, any costs incurred in excess of the amount
previously allotted will be allowable to the same extent as if incurred afterwards, unless the contracting officer issues a termination or other
notice directing that the increase is solely for the purpose of covering termination or other specified expenses.

e. Change orders issued under the Changes clause are not an authorization to exceed the amount allotted in the Schedule, in the absence of a
statement in the change order or other contractual modification increasing the amount allotted.

f. Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Postal Service to terminate this contract. If the contract is terminated, the Postal Service
and the supplier must negotiate an equitable distribution of all property produced or purchased under the contract, based upon the share of
costs incurred by each.

g. If sufficient funds are not allotted to this contract to allow completion of the work contemplated, the supplier will be entitled to a
percentage of the fee set forth in the Schedule equivalent to the


CLAUSE 2-38 PAYMENT (TIME-AND-MATERIALS AND LABOR-HOUR CONTRACTS) (MARCH 2006)




The Postal Service will pay the supplier as follows upon submission of invoices or vouchers approved by the contracting officer:

a. Hourly Rate
(1) The amounts will be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number or direct labor hours
performed. The rates will include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expenses, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour will be
payable on a prorated basis. Vouchers may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals if approved by the contracting officer).
The supplier will substantiate vouchers by evidence of actual payment and by individual daily job timecards, or other substantiation approved by
the contracting officer. Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Postal Service will, except as otherwise provided in this
contract, and subject to the terms of paragraph e below, pay the voucher as approved by the contracting officer.
(2) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the contracting officer will withhold five percent of the amounts due under this paragraph a,
but the total amount withheld may not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld will be retained until the execution and delivery of any required
release by the supplier.




(3) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule must not be varied by virtue of the supplier having performed
work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the contracting
officer, overtime rates may be negotiated. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable
only to the extent the overtime is approved by the contracting officer.

b. Materials and Subcontracts
(1) Allowable costs of direct materials will be determined by the contracting officer in accordance with the Conduct Price/Cost Analysis topic
of the Evaluate Proposals task of Process Step 2: Evaluate Sources of the Postal Service Supplying Practices in effect on the date of this
contract. Reasonable and allocable material handling costs may be included in the charge for material to the extent they are clearly excluded
from the hourly rate.
(2) The actual costs of subcontracts that are authorized under the Subcontracts clause of this contract are reimbursable; provided, they are
consistent with subparagraph 3 following.
(3) To the extent possible, the supplier must:
(a) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available, with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and
(b) Take all available cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take
advantage of the benefits, the supplier will promptly notify the contracting officer and give the reasons. Credit will be given to the Postal
Service for cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, the value of any appreciable scrap, commissions, and other amounts
that have accrued to the benefit of the supplier, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the supplier. The benefits lost
without fault or neglect on the part of the supplier, or lost through no fault of the contracting officer, will not be deducted from gross
costs.

c. Total Cost. It is estimated that the total cost for performing this contract will not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, and
the supplier agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work within this ceiling price. Whenever the supplier has reason to believe that the
hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing the contract in the next 60 days, if added to all other payments and
costs previously accrued, will exceed the ceiling price, the supplier must notify the contracting officer, giving any revised estimate of the
total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. Whenever the supplier has reason to believe that the total
price for this contract will be greater than or substantially less than the then stated ceiling price, the supplier must notify the contracting
officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. Whenever the
Postal Service has reason to believe that the work required will be greater than or substantially less than the then stated ceiling price, the
contracting officer will advise the supplier, giving a revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.

d. Ceiling Price. The Postal Service is not obligated to pay the supplier any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the
supplier is not obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price, until the contracting officer notifies the
supplier in writing that the ceiling price has been increased, specifying a revised ceiling price for performance under the contract. When the
ceiling price is increased, any hours expended or material costs incurred in excess of the ceiling price before the increase will be allowable
to the same extent as if expended or incurred afterwards.

e. Audit. At any time or times before final payment, the contracting officer may request audit of the invoices or vouchers and substantiating
material. Each payment previously made will be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices or vouchers, that are found
by the contracting officer not to have been properly payable and will also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for
underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher or invoice designated by the supplier as the completion voucher or completion invoice
and substantiating


material, and upon compliance by the supplier with any required release and all other terms of this contract, the Postal Service will promptly
pay any balance due. The completion invoice or voucher, and substantiating material, must be submitted by the supplier as promptly as
practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than one year (or such longer period as the contracting
officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.


CLAUSE 2-49 COST/PRICE REDUCTION (MARCH 2006)




During the term of this contract, the Postal Service reserves the right to negotiate price reductions for any good or service being purchased.
During the term of this contract, the Postal Service expects the supplier to continually seek to improve production and performance processes
and method, and to report on these efforts to the Postal Service. Additionally, price reductions may be sought by the Postal Service as a result
of changes in market conditions, industry trends and indexes, or in cost/price indexes, and their impact on the supplier's cost elements or
overall cost. The Postal Service may terminate this contract for convenience if it feels price reductions are warranted, but the parties cannot
reach an agreement on such price reductions.


CLAUSE 3-1 SMALL, MINORITY, AND WOMAN-OWNED BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS (MARCH 2006)




a. All suppliers except small businesses must submit a subcontracting plan that is specific to this contract, and that separately addresses
subcontracting with small, minority, and woman-owned businesses. A plan approved by the Postal Service must be included in and made a part of
the contract. Lack of an approved plan may make the supplier ineligible for award. A subcontract is defined as any agreement (other than one
involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Postal Service supplier or subcontractor calling for supplies or services
required for performance of the contract or subcontract.

b. The supplier's subcontracting plan must include the following:

method used to determine the proportionate share of indirect costs to be incurred with small, minority, and woman-owned businesses.
(7) The name of the individual employed by the supplier who will administer the subcontracting program and a description of the individual's
duties.
(8) Assurances that the supplier will require all subcontractors receiving subcontracts in excess of $1,000,000 to adopt a plan similar to the

of the types described in Clause 3-2, Participation of Small, Minority, and Woman-owned Businesses.


CLAUSE 4-1 GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS (JULY 2007)




a. Inspection and Acceptance. The supplier will only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The
Postal Service reserves the right to inspect or test supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Postal Service may require
repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. The Postal Service
must exercise its post acceptance rights (1) within a reasonable period of time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered
and (2) before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the items, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

b. Assignment. If this contract provides for payments aggregating $10,000 or more, claims for monies due or to become due from the Postal
Service under it may be assigned to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any federal lending agency, and may
thereafter be further assigned and reassigned to any such institution. Any assignment or reassignment must cover all amounts payable and must
not be made to more than one party, except that assignment or reassignment may be made to one party as agent or trustee for two or more parties
participating in financing this contract. No assignment or reassignment will be recognized as valid and binding upon the Postal Service unless a

GENERAL INFORMATION



1 Purpose


The USPS is currently engaged in programs that require information sharing between the USPS and external trading partners.  The information
sharing channels between the USPS and external customers must be secure and must meet operational requirements for high availability,
scalability, and resiliency.  USPS currently makes use of COTS and in-house, customized managed file transfer solutions that support multiple
protocols, including Applicability Statement 2 (AS2), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and SFTP.  These solutions support approximately 2,000
trading partners and have interfaces with 70 distinct backend USPS applications, with the number of USPS trading partners increasing on a weekly
basis.  FTP has been identified by the USPS Corporate Information Security Office as an unsecure communications protocol and is no longer
approved for internal or external connectivity.  As such, FTP as a protocol is slated to be decommissioned at USPS.  In addition, the SFTP
solutions currently in place will not meet future requirements for high availability, scalability, and resiliency.

As part of continuous improvement to infrastructure and quality of service, the USPS will replace existing FTP and SFTP service applications
that are in use, through integration of a new COTS SFTP solution that incorporates message payload encryption through Pretty Good Protocol (PGP)
and GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).  The COTS solution will be integrated into the DTS B2B / EDI environment with any required configuration or
customizations, which are expected to be minimal.  The implementation is expected to span standard USPS Technology Solution Life Cycle (TSLC)
development tasks, including requirements definition, design, build, test, and implementation of the SFTP solution.

This document provides demonstration use cases that describe typical implementation scenarios for use and operation of the SFTP solution.  These
demonstration use cases will allow potential Suppliers of the SFTP solution to conduct a live demonstration of the proposed solution, and for
USPS to assess and validate the technical capabilities of the proposed solution.

3 Post Conditions / Exit Criteria

The following post conditions / exit criteria apply to all use cases:

   1. The file was successfully transferred and can easily be tracked in the application GUI.
   2. The file failed for one of the reasons stated in the Alternate Flow and an alert was generated.
   3. The status of the file failure can easily be tracked and the issue resolved in the application GUI.


4 Basic Flow / Positive Path



1 Use Case 1

Description: This use case demonstrates a typical SFTP, outbound file transfer to a trading partner’s SFTP server:

   1. The USPS Application sends a file to SFTP via AFT and the file lands in a partner and protocol specific directory. (ex.
      /dts/sftp/tradingpartner1/payroll/outbound/)
   2. The directory is monitored by the SFTP software and picked up within 1 minute of arrival (i.e. on demand, event-based).  Each file is only
      processed after a period of inactivity to ensure that a complete and whole file is received.  The file is removed from the pickup location.
   3. The file is PGP encrypted and signed using the trading partner’s public key and the USPS private key.
   4. Move the original file to an encrypted archive or place the encrypted file in archive for reporting, reprocessing, and research purposes.
      The archived file is uniquely named and easy to identify.  (ex. Originalfilename.datetime)
   5. The file is transferred via SFTP to the Trading Partner 1’s SFTP server.  The file is placed in the default directory.  If a connection
      error occurs, the file transfer is retried 3 times at 60 second intervals.
   6. The local, working file on the USPS server is deleted.



2 Use Case 2

Description: The external trading partner has an SFTP VMS OS server that uses Key Authentication or username and password for login.  The
filenames that are received from the partner’s server contain semicolon “;” characters that the existing USPS SFTP Unix system cannot handle.
Special code was developed to remove the characters in the filename before the file is processed. The files received are not PGP encrypted. The
positive path is as follows:

   1. At 20:25, 20:55, 21:25 and 21:55 EDT on Fridays, an SFTP process is initiated by the USPS SFTP software.
   2. Validate that no other SFTP process for this data flow is running.  If another process is running, exit until next schedule run.
   3. The SFTP process logs in to Trading Partner 2’s SFTP server, changes to the OUTBOUND directory, retrieves all files that are in the
      directory and deletes them as they are retrieved.  Before the file is moved to the next step, the SFTP program strips the semicolon
      characters from the filename.  If a connection error occurs, the file transfer is retried 3 times at 60 second intervals.
   4. Move each file to an encrypted archive or place an encrypted file in archive for reporting, reprocessing, and research purposes.  The
      archived file is uniquely named and easy to identify.  (ex. Originalfilename.datetime)
   5. Each file is placed on shared storage in a partner/protocol specific directory for EDI translation software to retrieve. (ex.
      /dts/edi/tradingpartner2/inbound/)  The file deposit must be an atomic move or initially written to a temporary location and then moved to
      the ultimate destination to prevent race conditions with the EDI translation software file pickup.



3 Use Case 3

Description: This use case is a typical SFTP, inbound file transfer using the USPS SFTP server:

   1. Trading Partner 3 logs into the USPS SFTP server using username and password authentication.
   2. The partner goes to the receive/inbound directory and puts one (1) to many PGP encrypted files.
   3. Monitoring is in place to detect and process files that are deposited in the partner inbound directory/account.  Each file is only
      processed after a period of inactivity to ensure that a complete and whole file is received.
   4. Move each file to an encrypted archive or place an encrypted file in archive for reporting, reprocessing, and research purposes.  The
      archived file is uniquely named and easy to identify.  (ex. Originalfilename.datetime)
   5. Each file is decrypted and signature verified using the USPS private key and the trading partner’s public key.
   6. A success email is generated for each file received.  The recipient of the message is the internal USPS application for this data flow
      (i.e. email recipient is specific to this partner and file transfer).
   7. The SFTP software places the unencrypted data in a partner specific landing directory. (ex. /dts/aft/tradingpartner3/inbound/)
   8. The SFTP software calls an external Perl script, passing the FQFN of each file, to transfer the data to the internal USPS application via
      the AFT protocol.



4 Use Case 4

Description: This is a typical, high volume SFTP inbound file transfer using the USPS SFTP server.  These partners only send files at their
Close of Business.  Typical volume is 150-200 files for one session.

   1. Trading Partner 4 logs into the USPS SFTP server using key authentication.
   2. The partner goes to the receive/inbound directory and puts all of their PGP encrypted, end of day files into the directory.
   3. Monitoring is in place to detect and process files that are deposited in the partner inbound directory/account.  Each file is only
      processed after a period of inactivity to ensure that a complete and whole file is received.
   4. Move each file to an encrypted archive or place an encrypted file in archive for reporting, reprocessing, and research purposes.  The
      archived file is uniquely named and easy to identify.  (ex. Originalfilename.datetime)
   5. Each file is decrypted and signature verified using the USPS private key and the trading partner’s public key.
   6. The SFTP software places the unencrypted data in a partner specific landing directory. (ex. /dts/aft/tradingpartner4/inbound/)
   7. The SFTP software calls an external Perl script, passing the FQFN of each file, to transfer the data to the internal USPS application via
      the AFT protocol.



5 Use Case 5

Description: This use case demonstrates the ability to take action based on a filename and to do SFTP port override.  Files are placed in
different SFTP directories based on naming and the partner’s SFTP server is hosted on a different SFTP port.

   1. The USPS Application sends files to SFTP via AFT and the file lands in a partner and protocol specific directory. (ex.
      /dts/sftp/tradingpartner5/outbound/)
   2. The directory is monitored by the SFTP software and files picked up within 1 minute of arrival (i.e. on demand, event-based).  Each file is
      only processed after a period of inactivity to ensure that a complete and whole file is received.  The file is removed from the pickup
      location.
   3. The file is PGP encrypted and signed using the trading partner’s public key and the USPS private key.
   4. Move the original file to an encrypted archive or place the encrypted file in archive for reporting, reprocessing, and research purposes.
      The archived file is uniquely named and easy to identify.  (ex. Originalfilename.datetime)
   5. The files are transferred via SFTP to the Trading Partner 5’s SFTP server using port 5022 instead of port 22.  The file is placed in the
      corresponding directory for its filename on trading partner 5’s SFTP server (ex. Payroll.txt is placed in the /inbound/usps/payroll
      directory.  Pts.txt is placed in the /inbound/usps/pts directory).  If a connection error occurs, the file transfer is retried 3 times at
      60 second intervals.
   6. The local, working file on the USPS server is deleted.



6 Use Case 6

Description: This use case demonstrates the ability to pick up inbound files from multiple folders on a partner’s SFTP server but only pick up
certain files from each folder, using a complex pickup schedule.

The pickup schedule for this partner is as follows:

           Sunday – Thursday at 20:00-23:00 every 15 minutes.
           Monday – Friday at 00:00-15:00 every 15 minutes.
           Monday – Friday at 16:00, 16:15, 16:30


The directories and files to pick up from this partner are as follows:


           Outbound/payroll only pay_20* files
           Outbound/finance       only pay_30* files
           Outbound/banking       only bank*.txt files
           Outbound/tracking      only *.bank.* files


   1. At the stated schedule times, an SFTP process is initiated by the USPS SFTP software.
   2. Validate that no other SFTP process for this data flow is running.  If another process is running, exit until next schedule run.
   3. The SFTP process logs in to Trading Partner 5’s SFTP server, checks all of the outbound directories configured, retrieves all files that
      configured for that particular directory and deletes them as they are retrieved.  If a connection error occurs, the file transfer is
      retried 3 times at 60 second intervals.
   4. Move each file to an encrypted archive or place an encrypted file in archive for reporting, reprocessing, and research purposes.  The
      archived file is uniquely named and easy to identify.  (ex. Originalfilename.datetime)
   5. Each file is decrypted and signature verified using the USPS private key and the trading partner’s public key.
   6. Each file for the outbound/tracking directory (i.e. *.bank.* files) are placed on shared storage in a partner/protocol specific directory
      for the EDI translation software to retrieve (ex. /dts/edi/tradingpartner5/inbound/) The file deposit must be an atomic move or initially
      written to a temporary location and then moved to the ultimate destination to prevent race conditions with the EDI translation software
      file pickup.
   7. For all other files, the USPS SFTP software calls an external Perl script, passing the FQFN of each file, to transfer the data to the
      internal USPS application via the AFT protocol.



7 Use Case 7

Description: This use case demonstrates how to add, setup, modify, and remove a trading partner via the SFTP software GUI.  Use the
specifications laid out in Use Cases 5 and 6 to demonstrate setting up and configuring an SFTP trading partner.

INTRODUCTION


1 Background

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is currently engaged in programs that require information sharing between the USPS and external trading
partners.  The information sharing channels between the USPS and external customers must be secure and must meet operational requirements for
high availability, scalability, and resiliency.  As part of continuous improvement to infrastructure and quality of service, the USPS is seeking
a replacement of existing secure and non-secure file transfer capabilities that will meet these requirements.

This Statement of Work (SOW) describes the need for a centralized Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) solution.  This solution will provide
USPS with a corporate infrastructure system for secure and reliable information sharing with external trading partners.  The USPS seeks a
Supplier who offers a robust, comprehensive SFTP solution and the capability and experience to implement and integrate the solution into the
USPS environment.

1 USPS Data Transfer Services

The USPS’s Data Transfer Services (DTS) is the managing authority for all USPS external file transfers.  DTS retains centralized responsibility
for the implementation, management and support for all corporate internal and external file transfer capabilities.  This includes inbound and
outbound file transfers of any kind between the USPS and external entities or trading partners.  DTS retains two primary areas of focus and
responsibility:

    • Customer Integration – The DTS Business to Business / Electronic Data Interchange (B2B / EDI) team implements new products, new features,
      sets up file transfers, and performs all setup work for onboarding of new external entities or trading partners.

    • Operations – The DTS Operations team handles day-to-day production operations, monitoring, and issue resolution for all internal and
      external file transfer capabilities.  DTS is a 24x7 operation, with onsite support always available.

DTS services are designated Tier 0 services, which translates to a desired objective total uptime of 99.95%.  This designation results in
engineering and design of data file transfer services in such a manner to be sufficiently scalable and resilient to meet high availability
requirements.  DTS services and applications must be designed, maintained, and upgraded with no interruption of services to USPS customers and
no loss of data during both normal and contingency operations.


2 Current Environment

DTS currently makes use of Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and in-house, customized managed file transfer solutions that support multiple
protocols, including Applicability Statement 2 (AS2), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and SFTP.  These solutions support approximately 2,000
trading partners and have interfaces with 70 distinct backend USPS applications, with the number of USPS trading partners increasing on a weekly
basis.  FTP has been identified by the USPS Corporate Information Security Office as an unsecure communications protocol and is no longer
approved for internal or external connectivity.  In addition, the SFTP solutions currently in place will not meet future requirements for high
availability, scalability, and resiliency.  As such, FTP as a protocol is slated to be decommissioned at USPS.

Current DTS Operations monitoring and support is based upon email alerts with low signal-to-noise ratio.  As a result, a typical operating day
may result in 1,500 to 2,500 email alerts that vary in priority and criticality, causing support issues for the DTS Operations team.
Centralized monitoring and reporting features such as dashboards or other non-email based alerts are needed to improve DTS support, monitoring,
research, issue resolution, and file recovery activities.

USPS DTS’s standard midrange hosting environment for B2B / EDI applications consists of traditional and cloud based servers.  Both offerings are
hosted on HP X86 based servers.  All storage is either SAN or NAS provided by EMC.  SAN is provided via dual channel fiber and NAS is provided
via gigabit network interconnects.  Traditional or dedicated servers run SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 and are available with up to 32 CPU
cores and 192 GB of memory.  Cloud based servers run VMWare ESX Server and SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 or 11.  Cloud based systems are
available with up to 16 virtual CPUs and 96 GB of RAM.

2 Scope

To be considered as a viable Supplier for this effort, the Supplier must provide a detailed and complete response that addresses the
requirements of this SOW.  The Supplier’s response must demonstrate the management, functional, and technical expertise necessary to support the
phased implementation of the COTS SFTP solution into the DTS B2B / EDI environment.  The Supplier’s response must include a description of the
proposed SFTP product, features, and solution architecture that will meet the desired capability requested.  The Supplier’s response must also
demonstrate adequate corporate capability and experience to complete the work described in this SOW.  The requirements of this SOW incorporate
support for the following phased activities, described in detail in this SOW and Appendix A – USPS SFTP Requirements Matrix:

Phase 1 and Phase 2:

   1. Systems Development and Integration – Integrate the COTS solution into the DTS B2B / EDI environment with any required configuration or
      customizations.  Complete development tasks, including requirements definition, design, build, test, and implementation of the SFTP
      solution.  The proposed SFTP solution must meet the functional and technical requirements of this SOW.  Sub tasks of this activity include:

        a. Verification and Validation – Provide test support during verification and validation of SFTP solution performance within the USPS
           DTS environment.  This will be conducted through Systems Integration, Customer Acceptance, Reliability, Scalability, Availability,
           and Business Continuity testing.
        b. Compliance – Demonstrate compliance of the SFTP solution with USPS corporate requirements in the areas Security and Privacy,
           including the USPS Handbook AS-805, Information Security.
        c. Deployment – Complete tasks related to the non-production and production environment deployment leading to Go-Live of the SFTP
           solution.  This includes completion of final verification and validation, data conversion, system documentation, and post Go-Live
           support tasks.

The USPS requires that the Supplier adhere to the standards of the USPS Technology Solution Life Cycle (TSLC) during completion of tasks for
requirements, analysis and design, build, testing, release and ongoing operations and maintenance support.

   2. Training and Documentation – Develop training materials and deliver training to USPS personnel on use of the SFTP solution during normal
      operations and customer on-boarding.  Complete transition of operations and maintenance of any customized solution components to USPS DTS
      personnel.

   3. Migration of Legacy Connections – Complete tasks for managing organizational or business process changes related to the phased conversion
      of external entities or trading partners to the new SFTP solution.  This includes the conversion of approximately 600 trading partners from
      existing file transmission methodology to the new SFTP solution.

   4. Operations Support and Software Maintenance – Provide support for ongoing maintenance of the SFTP software solution, including assistance
      with troubleshooting of application issues within the USPS environment, and corrective and perfective maintenance for continuous
      performance improvement of the solution.

   5. Project and Release Management – Manage the planning and execution of project tasks and system releases through all phases of development,
      implementation, migration, and ongoing operations and maintenance of the SFTP solution.  Management tasks approved by USPS will cover
      system configuration, transition, organizational and business process changes, releases, defect mitigation, and overall reporting of
      project status.

Phase 3:

   1. Migration of Legacy Connections – Complete tasks for managing organizational or business process changes related to the conversion of the
      remaining approximately 10,000 externally-facing FTP connections, not currently under DTS’s managing authority, to the new SFTP solution.




3 Contract Type

The Phase 1 and Phase 2 tasks defined in this SOW will be awarded as Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  Solely at its discretion, the USPS reserves the
right to award the Phase 3 tasks defined in this SOW as Time & Materials (T&M).

4 Period of Performance

The base period for the resulting FFP contract is two (2) years from the date of the award with the option to renew for two (2) additional one-
year periods.

5 Place of Performance

The work associated with the subsequent award will take place at the following primary location:

US Postal Service – Data Transfer Services (DTS)

Additional work as determined and approved by USPS may be required at host computing centers in Eagan, MN and San Mateo, CA.  Off-site work at
the Supplier’s facilities for solution development described in this SOW will be allowed at the discretion of USPS DTS.  The Supplier should
provide a description of any planned off-site work and on-site and off-site rates with their proposal.

The Supplier must detail the travel required for completing the deliverables and total solution as part of the technical response.  This
includes, but is not limited to detailing (for each deliverable) the trip purpose, duration (# of days), number / type of attendees, and any
information necessary for the USPS to assess travel needs.  Cost information for any travel is to be outlined only in the Supplier pricing
proposal document.  Travel must be conducted in accordance with the USPS F-15 Travel and Relocation Handbook.

6 Security Clearance

To gain access to the USPS computer environment, the Supplier’s personnel are required to obtain a USPS security clearance.  The requirements
and procedure are outlined in the ASM-13 Administrative Support Manual.  Among other requirements, USPS Supplier’s personnel must be United
States citizens or must have lived in the United States for at least 5 years so that US Inspection Service can conduct a background search.

The Supplier’s proposal should demonstrate acceptable evidence of the ability to staff personnel that are able to obtain a USPS security
clearance.  The security approval of personnel assigned to work on this project should not cause delays in the project schedule.

The Supplier shall declare if any portion of the work to be performed under this agreement shall be performed by a subcontractor, and if yes,
identify the proposed subcontractor in their response to this solicitation.  The Supplier and their subcontractors may be required to obtain a
USPS Security Clearance if the tasks undertaken as a result of this award require them to access USPS network, computer systems or perform tasks
at a USPS location.




WORK TO BE PERFORMED


1 General Description

USPS DTS seeks a qualified Supplier to replace the existing FTP and SFTP service applications that are in use, through integration of a new COTS
SFTP solution that incorporates message payload encryption through Pretty Good Protocol (PGP) / GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).  The USPS expects a
minimal level of customization to integrate the COTS product into the USPS B2B / EDI environment.  The Supplier should describe any
customizations required to fulfill desired solution features in the response to this SOW.

The Supplier’s response and Past Performance must demonstrate the ability to complete the work to be performed described in this section.  The
Supplier’s response must also include a description of the proposed COTS SFTP product, features, and solution architecture that will meet the
functional and technical requirements provided in this SOW.  Many critical requirements, determined by USPS to be ‘mandatory,’ ‘highly
desirable,’ or ‘desirable,’ are specified in Appendix A – USPS SFTP Requirements Matrix.  The Supplier must provide a clear and concise response
for each of the requirements listed in Appendix A.  Sales and marketing materials are not permitted for this response.

DTS’s preferred architecture is based on multiple active-active clusters of each application within the primary data center in Eagan, MN with
near real-time replication to USPS’s secondary data center in San Mateo, CA for disaster recovery.  Several existing DTS applications are also
able to run active-active in both data centers.  The Supplier should indicate if it is possible to operate the proposed SFTP solution in this
configuration.

The new SFTP solution and all future deployments of B2B / EDI applications are planned for the aforementioned environment.  However, the
Supplier’s proposed SFTP solution architecture is not currently constrained to this environment, and the Supplier may propose alternatives that
meet the solution requirements described in this section.

The Supplier’s response must include a proposed schedule for completing the work to be performed in this section within the planned timeframe of
the project.  The SFTP solution is expected to be implemented and made available to USPS’s external trading partners in a phased manner.  Each
phase brings incremental value to USPS.  Completion of the first phase will enable the follow-on phases for migration of existing USPS trading
partners:

   1. Phase 1 – Develop and implement the new SFTP solution into the current DTS B2B / EDI environment.  This phase is planned to be completed by
      January 15, 2015.

   2. Phase 2 – Plan and execute the initial conversion of approximately 600 trading partners from existing file transmission methodology to the
      new SFTP solution.  This phase is planned to be completed by September 30, 2015.

   3. Phase 3 – Plan and execute the conversion of the remaining approximately 10,000 externally-facing FTP connections, not currently under
      DTS’s managing authority, to the new SFTP solution.  This phase is planned to be completed by December 31, 2017.

The USPS requires that the Supplier adhere to the standards of the USPS Technology Solution Life Cycle (TSLC) during completion of tasks for
requirements, analysis and design, build, testing, release and ongoing operations and maintenance support.  The software development methodology
used for this effort will comply with TSLC.

2 Deliverables – General Format

Unless otherwise noted, the Supplier must submit soft copies of reports, schedules, briefings and other deliverable documents in the appropriate
Microsoft Office 2003 or newer formats (e.g., Word, Excel, Project, PowerPoint, etc.).  For review time, CD = Calendar Days and BD = Business
Days, CA = Contract Award.

Documentation is detailed information which describes the product software and is directed toward meeting the needs of those who will manage and
maintain the application and end users who will process information, enter data or retrieve system information within the USPS environment.

The Supplier shall prepare and deliver documentation in accordance with the following requirements, unless otherwise noted:

   1. Documentation shall be delivered in a format and size in accordance with the Supplier’s standard commercial practice (e.g., 6 1/4 by 8 1/2
      inch, etc.). Documentation shall be clear and legible; insertion in a 3-ring loose leaf binder is preferred. Unless otherwise specified,
      the Supplier shall deliver one (1) each single-sided, camera-ready original 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch (reproduction “master”) as part of the
      documentation package.
   2. Additionally, all documented deliverables and updated versions or changes will be submitted in electronic format via email and/or disc
      (CD).
   3. USPS will entertain alternative proposals for on-line documentation.

Note:  The Supplier may propose breaking up a single deliverable into multiple deliverables (depending on the system life cycle methodology
proposed) and/or combining multiple deliverables into a single deliverable.  As previously noted, whatever development methodology is used, the
Supplier is still responsible for fulfilling the requirements of the TSLC.  If this is done, the Supplier must propose a mapping of SOW
deliverables to proposed deliverables, and an explanation of why this is requested, the benefit to the USPS, and how it is in the best interests
of the USPS in terms of cost, schedule, and overall quality.   This mapping must be provided in a single consolidated table as part of the
Supplier response, and should be contained in both the technical and price volumes.

The approach and all phases of the solution must be compliant with USPS development standards; reference USPS Application Development Standards
located at:

http://itwebshare.usps.gov/sites/itweb/PPSDocumentViewer.aspx?DocPath=IT+Policies+Document+Library%2fStandards%2fApplication+Development+Standard
s.mht

The USPS Portfolio Program Manager, Business Project Leader, or their designee shall have oversight of all deliverables and review the
deliverables for completeness, consistency and accuracy, in accordance with the acceptance criteria identified above submit approval/rejection
in writing within ten (10) business days.

3 Deliverables – General Acceptance Criteria

The USPS shall apply the following general acceptance criteria to all deliverables.  Prior to starting work on a task/deliverable, the Supplier
will meet with the USPS and ensure there is written agreement on the purpose, format, scope and content of each deliverable to minimize any
misunderstanding.  This is not anticipated to be a lengthy or time intensive process.

All deliverables work must include a standard process for submission and review of a draft deliverable by the USPS (unless waived by the USPS
Management Team), and publishing of the final deliverable.  If the Supplier determines a specific draft deliverable requires more than one
formal review during task execution, (this is different than review of normal iterative work products) it should propose multiple reviews.

USPS will assess each deliverable for completeness and accuracy based on its intended purpose (as generally defined in the USPS TSLC), the
initial deliverable planning discussions, as outlined in the requirements, and in keeping with the intent of the USPS TSLC processes.  The
following general acceptance criteria will be used:

    • Includes all of the content stated in the description in the SOW
    • Adheres to USPS business and technical standards
    • Satisfies the stated requirements and acceptance criteria
    • Free of ambiguous statements, contradictions, and confusing terminology
    • Assumptions and constraints are valid

The USPS Portfolio Program Manager, Business Project Leader, or their designee shall have oversight of all deliverables and review the
deliverables for completeness, consistency and accuracy, in accordance with the acceptance criteria identified above submit approval/rejection
in writing within ten (10) business days.

The USPS IT-PM and Business PM will review the execution of non-written deliverables—that is, developed, customized and/or installed
software—according to the following general acceptance criteria:

    • The software was developed in accordance with all USPS business and technical standards, and meets the requirements in this SOW.
    • All documentation relating to the software was delivered and accepted by the USPS IT-PM.
    • The software was tested in accordance with all USPS business and technical standards, and in accordance with the requirements provided in
      this SOW. This criterion includes Unit/Functional Test, System Integration Test (SIT), and Customer Acceptance Test (CAT).
    • The software is implemented according to the design accepted by the USPS IT-PM.
    • The software performs as required by the SOW.
    • The software was installed and transitioned to in accordance with all USPS business and technical standards, and in accordance with the
      requirements in this SOW.
    • All production code must pass Unit Test, SIT and CAT.

6 Task #6 – Solution Design Support

|Description             |USPS requires the Supplier to provide support for design of the SFTP solution based on the approved requirements.   |
|                        |                                                                                                                    |

|                        |The new SFTP solution and all future deployments of B2B / EDI applications are planned to be implemented into the   |
|                        |current DTS infrastructure environment.  However, the Supplier’s proposed SFTP solution design is not currently     |
|                        |constrained to this environment, and the Supplier may submit a design that meets the requirements of the solution,  |
|                        |including functionality, performance, and business continuity. The proposed SFTP solution design should also promote|
|                        |the reduction and control of energy consumption, waste, and the USPS’s carbon footprint.                            |

14 Task #14 – Migration of DTS Managed External Partners

|Description             |USPS requires the Supplier to plan and execute the initial conversion of approximately 600 trading partners from    |
|                        |existing file transmission methodology to the new SFTP solution.  These trading partner connections are currently   |
|                        |managed by DTS and operate on DTS infrastructure.  This phase is planned to be completed by September 30, 2015.     |
|                        |                                                                                                                    |
|                        |Develop the plan and schedule for conversion of external partner connections currently managed by DTS.  The Supplier|
|                        |must develop the plan to have minimal or no impact to current external partners or internal USPS operations.  The   |
|                        |conversion plan may be completed over a period time, i.e., the conversion of each trading partner does not have to  |
|                        |be completed at the same time.                                                                                      |
|                        |Update and create internal Configuration Guides for each trading partner that is migrated, in the predefined format |
|                        |to be provided by DTS.  The guides will provide DTS with reference for operations and maintenance of each external  |
|                        |connection.                                                                                                         |

|                        |This task requires close coordination with DTS and with the USPS business teams that manage the customer            |
|                        |relationships associated with these external connections.                                                           |

|                        |Wherever possible, the Supplier must incorporate USPS customizations with minimal modification to the commercial    |
|                        |product.  Within ten (10) working days of the release of an upgrade/patch to the commercial product on which the    |
|                        |SFTP solution is based, the Supplier must submit a proposal to the USPS outlining the feasibility, cost, benefit and|
|                        |lead time associated with updating the application.  If the software updates / upgrades require installation by the |
|                        |Supplier, the installation will be performed at a mutually agreed time to minimize USPS operations interruptions.   |
|                        |                                                                                                                    |
|                        |USPS anticipates upgrades to the COTS and custom software to occur quarterly.  Changes can be accomplished using    |
|                        |system administration functions, such as boilerplate text changes, script or matrix updates, and software           |
|                        |configuration item changes.  COTS upgrades must address regression testing of the release for assurance that SFTP   |
|                        |customizations function properly with the COTS upgrade.  The plan must include regression testing with USPS         |
|                        |customizations as a pre-requisite to release of COTS upgrades.                                                      |

|                        |Costs incurred by the Supplier in identifying and correcting software problems and deficiencies attributable to the |
|                        |Supplier will be borne by the Supplier.                                                                             |

|                        |Solely at its discretion, the USPS reserves the right to award Phase 3 / Task #18 as defined in this SOW as Time &  |
|                        |Materials (T&M).                                                                                                    |

|                        |USPS requires the Supplier to plan and execute the conversion of the remaining approximately 10,000                 |
|                        |externally-facing FTP connections to the new SFTP solution.  These trading partner connections are not currently    |
|                        |managed by DTS and do not operate on DTS infrastructure.  This phase is planned to begin in September 2015 and      |
|                        |completed by December 31, 2017.                                                                                     |

|                        |Develop the plan and schedule for conversion of external partner connections not currently managed by DTS.  The     |
|                        |Supplier must develop the plan to have minimal or no impact to current external partners or internal USPS           |
|                        |operations.  The conversion plan may be completed over a period time, i.e., the conversion of each trading partner  |
|                        |does not have to be completed at the same time.                                                                     |
|                        |Update and create internal Configuration Guides for each trading partner that is migrated, in the predefined format |
|                        |to be provided by DTS.  The guides will provide DTS with reference for operations and maintenance of each external  |
|                        |connection.                                                                                                         |

|                        |This task requires close coordination with DTS and with the USPS business teams that manage the customer            |
|                        |relationships associated with these external connections.                                                           |

|                        |These external connections are not currently managed by DTS.  As a result, the Supplier will need to perform        |
|                        |additional discovery in the initiation phase of this project to document business requirements pertaining to these  |
|                        |trading partner connections.  The business requirements agreed to between DTS, the USPS business teams, and the     |
|                        |customer organizations will be used to configure the SFTP solution and enable the customer to access SFTP managed   |
|                        |services.                                                                                                           |

                                                            INSTRUCTIONS TO SUPPLIERS

       1) GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

The purpose of this procurement activity is to evaluate the solutions offered under a COTS delivery model that has the potential to  meet  Secure
File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) requirements, as detailed in Solicitation 1B-14-A-0006 and in conformance with the USPS  Statement  of  Work  (SOW)
(Attachment 1) and Requirements Matrix (Appendix A). Not all requirements anticipated by the SFTP solution may be available in  a  single  module
and the USPS reserves the right to make additional awards for services if it is determined to be in the best interests  or  represents  the  best
value to the USPS.

Compliance with all requirements of the SOW stated as “Must and Mandatory”  are  designated  as  a  mandatory  requirement.  Failure  to  meet  a
mandatory requirement is considered Non-Compliant and will disqualify the proposal from the competition.  If multiple offerors fail one  or  more
mandatory requirements a review will be held to determine which offerors may still compete at the discretion of USPS on the basis of  the  fewest
failures, nature of failure, and flexibility of the solution architecture.

Proposals not in conformance with these instructions may be rejected for not meeting the solicitation  requirements.   Technical  proposals  must
contain a complete description of all pertinent aspects of the effort the supplier wishes the USPS to  consider.  Previously  submitted  data  or
prior performance presumed to be known to the USPS (e.g., any previous projects performed for the USPS) may not be  considered  as  part  of  the
technical proposal evaluation unless currently outlined in a supplier’s proposal.  Any information that may have  been  submitted  prior  to  the
solicitation, but is still relevant, must be resubmitted in the formats requested.



The complete solicitation file is ordered in the following fashion:

  • 1B-14-A-0006 USPS Form 8203 and Terms and Conditions


Attachments to Solicitation 1B-14-A-0006

  • Attachment 1 Statement Of Work
  • Appendix A         Requirements Matrix
  • Appendix B         Use Cases
  • Attachment 2 Pricing Matrix
  • Attachment 3 Instructions to Offerors
  • Attachment 4 Evaluation Criteria
  • Attachment 5 Offeror Question Template
  • Attachment 6 Subcontracting Plan Guidance
  • Attachment 6A      Subcontracting Plan Checklist

All electronic softcopies of Proposals must be submitted by Friday, January 17 at 3pm Eastern Standard  Time.  Hardcopies  or  physical  proposal
material may be sent via Express Mail the following business day after the due date.  Tracking numbers must be provided  the  very  same  day  to
Pearl.M.Davis@usps.gov.  If there are questions, concerns, or clarifications needed regarding any of the information within the solicitation  and
statement of objectives; please contact Michelle Davis, Purchasing Specialist by email Pearl.M.Davis@usps.gov .  USPS  intent  is  to  avoid  any
errors due to Offeror assumptions.  Questions must be on Attachment 5 “Offeror Question Template” and emailed  no  later  than  Friday,  December
20th, 2013 at 3pm Eastern Standard Time.  Responses to questions will be sent by Friday, January 3rd at 3pm  Eastern  Standard  Time.   Suppliers
may submit questions anytime during the solicitation time period, however, the USPS may not respond in a timely manner.


The technical proposal must be sufficiently detailed and complete so as to demonstrate an understanding of the offeror’s approach and ability  to
comply with, the requirements of the solicitation, including all attachments and appendices.  Every proposal must demonstrate such  understanding
and ability in a concise, logical manner and must not contain superfluous material  (such  as  marketing  and  sales  information)  that  is  not
directly related to this acquisition.  Although there is no page limit, unnecessarily lengthy proposals with little value-added content  will  be
considered a weakness as part of the technical evaluation. Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond  those  sufficient  to
present a complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the Supplier's lack of cost consciousness.


General statements such as “that the offeror can or will comply  with  the  requirements”,  “standard  procedures  will  be  used”,  “well  known
techniques will be used”, or that paraphrase the Specification in whole  or  in  part  will  not  constitute  compliance  with  the  requirements
concerning the content of the technical proposals.  There must be enough detail for USPS to determine if  the  offeror  does  meet  requirements.
Explanations on how an offeror will meet a requirement should not reference another explanation of a different requirement.

The amount of detail to be presented in response to each section of the outline presented herein is left to the discretion of the Offeror  unless
otherwise specified.  Information must be presented in the  order  specified  and  in  sufficient  detail  for  the  Postal  Service  to  make  a
comprehensive evaluation of the offeror’s understanding of,  and  capability  to  perform,  the  solicitation’s  requirements.  offeror’s  should
reference Solicitation Attachment D “Evaluation Criteria” to obtain an understanding of the basis for evaluation.

       2) TABLE OF CONTENTS AND FORMAT
Proposals in response to this Solicitation must be in the form  of  written  responses  to  requirements  of  the  Statement  of  Objectives  and
Requirements Matrix.  The proposal shall be submitted in two parts: Technical Proposal and Pricing Proposal, and the  technical  proposal  should
not contain reference to cost.

Proposals should be submitted in the following manner:

                                                           Subcontracting Plan Guidance
                                          USPS Supplying Principles and Practices, effective May 1, 2006

So that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) may fully realize the benefit of a supplier base that reflects the diversity of the American supplier
community, buyers and purchase teams must continue to perform broad market research and analysis to identify and select the best suppliers.

Our principles and practices (Solicitation Provision 3-1, Notice of Small, Minority, and Woman-Owned Businesses Subcontracting Requirements,
Contract Clause 3-1, Small, Minority, and Woman-owned Businesses Subcontracting Requirements, and Contract Clause 3-2, Participation of Small,
Minority, and Woman-owned Businesses) promote and encourages supplier development and diversity throughout the supply chain.  It establishes
requirements for suppliers (with some exceptions) to submit contract-specific subcontracting plans with their proposals.  Subcontracting plans
which specifically address small, minority, and woman-owned businesses (SMWOB) are required for all contracts valued at $1 million or more.

A supplier’s plan is used in proposal evaluation and contract negotiation and then must be incorporated into the contract.  Suppliers are
encouraged to use SMWOB as subcontractors to the maximum extend consistent with effective contract performance.  Once the subcontracting plan is
incorporated in the contract, it is the responsibility of the Contracting Officer (CO)/buyer to monitor the supplier’s progress against the
goals established in the plan.

The materials that follow describe basic techniques to assist buyers in evaluation, negotiation, and monitoring progress of the subcontracting
plan.

   1. Preparation.  Fact-finding…know the market.  Market information gathered through market surveillance and investigation may be used to craft
      the purchasing strategy, solicitation, supplier selection, and contract (including the negotiated subcontracting plan).     Market research
      can provide:

        a. Current and projected availability of products
        b. Reliable sources (relevant in the marketplace)
        c. Extent of competition in the market and its effect on price, quality, special product features, and service
        d. Types of available support services
        e. Purchase histories (including previous market research documentation)

      Use the Subcontracting Checklist to ensure that all of the requirements outlined in the clause  are addressed in the subcontracting plan.

   2. Objectivity.  Make an assessment of resources.  The evaluation factors should be relevant based on the particular purchase and the business
      and competitive objectives.

        a. Identify sources of information (factual, verifiable data, or hear-say)
        b. Determine the age of data
        c. Consider the amount of data analyzed
        d. Past performance – supplier’s record of meeting previously planned concerning subcontracting with SMWOBs


   3. Strategy.  Setting goals.  Plan a course of action based on preparation and an objective appraisal of available resources. Our policy and
      the clauses that implement it, speak in terms of a goal…think of this as a “baseline”, which will become a contractual goal, once the
      subcontracting plan is incorporated into the contract.

      The goal should be reasonable and achievable based on your market research and assessment of resources.  Buyers are also encouraged to
      negotiate a “stretch” goal. The stretch goal should be clearly identified in the plan and does not become a contractual commitment.
      Rather, it focuses on promoting both effort and a commitment to continuous improvement by the supplier.


   4.   Modifications.  If, and when, the scope or term of the contract changes, the subcontracting plan should be revisited and adjusted, if
      appropriate.

   5.   Clarity of Communication.  Defining terms.  Our principles and practices focus on the SMWOB business categories which are defined in the
      Supplying Principles and Practices.  These terms do differ from those used by industry and Federal agencies.  There are many established
      business terms that we do not use, (i.e., Small Disadvantaged Business, Veteran-owned, Hub zones, etc.), insure that the supplier is aware
      of the differences between terms used in the USPS and other Federal agencies.  In reviewing subcontracting plans, insure that you and the
      supplier clarify business terms and jargon.  If necessary, define terms in the written agreement so others will not get confused.

      Clarifying relative words is just as important as asking others to explain specific terms and pieces of jargon.  Relative words are non-
      specific descriptive words that only have meaning in relationship to something else, (i.e., high quality, large, many, substantial), these
      words can create a great deal of confusion.  Insist that suppliers do not use generalities, get specific answers when negotiating the plan.



   6.   Performance.  Reporting and Monitoring results.  The reporting format, method, and submittal frequency are important topics for
      discussion during negotiations.   The supplier must submit calendar quarter reports (unless required more frequently by the CO) following
      one of three required methods:  (1) reports showing amount of money paid to subcontractors during the reporting period; (2) reports showing
      subcontracting activity that is allocable to the contract using generally accepted accounting practices; or (3) reports that are a
      combination of the two methods listed above.

      The supplier’s effort against the plan must be monitored as performance proceeds.  This can be done by reviewing the supplier submittals
      –assessing the results being reported against the negotiated plan.  Is the supplier on target?  Are they doing the things they said they
      would do in the plan?  Are the results in line with expectations?  If not, have you taken appropriate action?

   7.  Documentation.  All documentation of any negotiation should be retained for the life of the agreement.   Market research results should be
     compiled, analyzed, and documented in a manner that clearly supports the negotiated plan.  Consider the following when documenting your
     results:


        a. Identification of industry sources that were contacted and type of information obtained.
        b. Potential suppliers identified in market, specifically, SMWOBs.
        c. Summary of discussions regarding possible alternatives, requirements modifications, or trade-off analyses.
        d. Existing market conditions…if new products or new firms are entering the marketplace.

      Finally, document and retain all significant points of agreement and disagreement.  In the event of a later dispute over what was agreed to
      or the manner in which unsolved issues or disagreements are to be handled, such documentation will prove invaluable.  Documenting the
      results of the negotiation ensures that both sides fully understand all the points that have been agreed upon.

                                                       Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)


                                                                December 10, 2013



Evaluation Process


        The evaluation will consist of two phases:


        Phase I:

    • Review of offeror’s written proposals


Phase II:

      • Demonstrations\Oral Presentations


Functional Demonstration(s)


        Offerors’ written proposals will be evaluated against the requirements outlined in the  SFTP  Attachment  1,  Statement  of  Work;  SFTP
        Appendix A, Requirements Matrix.  If the offeror passes all mandatory requirements, the offeror will  be  provided  the  opportunity  to
        demonstrate the basic functionality of their software and provide an oral presentation of their  capabilities.   The  demonstration  and
        oral presentation will be used by the evaluation committee to confirm or refine their evaluation of the offeror’s proposal.   Therefore,
        while the oral presentations will not be scored separately, the presentation could form the basis  for  a  rescoring  of  the  technical
        proposal evaluation already performed prior to the demonstration.



Evaluation Criteria

The USPS may award one or multiple contracts resulting from this solicitation to the offeror(s) whose offer conforming to the solicitation is
deemed to offer the USPS the best value, price and other factors as specified considered.  The USPS will award this contract(s) to the
offeror(s) whose proposal offers the best value to the USPS.  Best value is reflected by the best combination of the technical and price
proposals.  The period of performance for the contract shall be for one year from the date of award.

The Postal Service may evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore,  the  offeror’s  initial  offer  should
contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. Discussions may be conducted if the Postal Service  determines  they  are
necessary. The Postal Service may reject any or all offers if such action is in the best interest of the Postal Service; accept  other  than  the
lowest offer, and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

Technical is more important than price.  Although price is considered in the award decision, the award may not necessarily be made to the
offeror submitting the lowest price. As the ratings for the technical factors among offeror become more equivalent, then cost or price will
become an increasingly significant factor.  However, to be considered for an award, an offer must be fairly and reasonably priced. The
Contracting Officer will determine whether any difference in technical quality is worth the difference in price.

A demonstration of the software will be required and used to validate the technical proposal.  Requirements not validated in the demonstration
will be reflected in offeror’s overall score accordingly.

In order to be considered for award, the offeror must meet all of the requirements specified. The  offeror’s  proposed  solution  must  meet  all
mandatory requirements specified in the SFTP SOW and its  appendices.  The  offeror’s  ability  to  meet  the  mandatory  requirements  shall  be
considered either pass or fail.  An offeror that submits a proposal that fails  any  of  the  mandatory  requirements  shall  be  ineligible  for
contract award.   If multiple offerors fail one or more mandatory requirements, a review will be held  to  determine  which  offerors  may  still
compete at the discretion of USPS on the basis of the fewest failures, nature of failure, and flexibility of the solution architecture.

The Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors within Factors are in descending order of importance as shown below:

[pic]

In descending order of importance, Factor 2 is more important than Factor 1.  Factor 1 is significantly more important than Factors 3 and 4,
which are equal.

Within Factor 2, F2 S1 is significantly more important than F2 S4.  F2 S4 is more important than F2 S2 and F2 S3. F2 S2 and F2 S3 are equal in
weight and are more important than F2 S5 and F2 S6.

Within Factor 1, F1 S2 and F1 S3 are equal in weight and are more important than F1 S4.  F1 S4 is more important that F1 S5 and F1 S6. F1 S5 and
F1 S6 are equal in weight and are more important than F1 S1.

There are no SubFactors in Factors 3 or 4.

Factor 1:   Solution Services Requirements:  Extent to which offeror's written proposal and supported via demonstration and oral presentation
addresses the business requirements and use cases.  The quality and comprehensiveness of the offeror's proposed solution will be evaluated.

See Appendix A, Requirements Matrix.

Factor 2:  Solution Features Requirements:    Extent to which offeror's written proposal and supported via demonstration and oral presentation
addresses the technical requirements as described in the Technical Requirements Matrix, including the feasibility, appropriateness, quality,
distinction and completeness of the offeror's technical capabilities and approach for ensuring superior performance, while providing efficiency,
economy and value to the USPS.

See Appendix A, Requirements Matrix.

Factor 3: Past Performance:  In response to this evaluation, the supplier shall demonstrate the capability, applicability and relevancy of
   experience in providing services similar to the requirements, maintenance and support services of similar scope and technology as defined in
   the USPS requirements.
The supplier and its subcontractor(s) shall provide the USPS with no fewer than three (3) references addressing the supplier’s relevant past
   performance and experience performing work of comparable scope, complexity and relevancy to this Statement of Objectives.
The supplier shall provide the following reference information for past performance assessment for each contract and subcontract in the format
   described below:
   a) Name of the customer or Government Agency and points of contact with telephone numbers.
   b) State product and version in use by the customer or Government Agency.
   c) Status of supplier as prime contractor or subcontractor. If subcontractor, identify prime contractor, describe functional relationship to
      prime under the referenced contract; provide name, address, and telephone number of corporate representative(s) of prime who is (are)
      familiar with contract in question.
   d) Role of supplier.
   e) Period of performance.
   f) Role in the project.
   g) Overall scope and complexity of the project, and the relevancy between the supplier's proposal and the referenced contract. Relevant
      projects are projects that required similar skills and services, particularly around partnering with the supplier’s client to iteratively
      close technology gaps. The projects selected for description should represent the best examples of the supplier's performance experience.
   h) Detailed description of the work performed.
   i) Discussion of problems encountered and how those problems were resolved.
   j) Describe any awards or certifications that indicate the supplier possesses a high quality process for providing the product of service
      required.
   k) Ability to meet delivery schedule.






Factor 4: Supplier Capability:  Offeror capability is evaluated in order to determine an Offeror’s ability to perform upon award of a contract.
   The Offeror must demonstrate its current capability. For joint ventures, each party must be deemed capable.  To be deemed capable, the Offeror
   must:

(1)   Have, or have the ability to obtain, resources (financial, technical, etc.) adequate to perform the work.
(2)   Be able to meet the required or proposed delivery schedule, considering all existing commitments, including awards pending.
(3)   Have the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, technical skills, and production and property controls.
(4)   Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations

Offeror’s and any subcontractors must have sufficient financial stability to support a project of this scale and must be able to garner an
appropriate credit line to secure and sustain adequate supplies and labor related to this project.  Include a copy of your most recent audited
financial statements (balance sheet, profit/loss statement, and statement of cash flows).  Submitted data must be certified by a company officer
as to the accuracy and veracity.  Note: If the company’s most recent financial statements are over one year old, send interim data (statements)
that are less than six months old.  Interim financials need not be audited.  For all open credit lines, submit letters from the bank(s) stating
the amount of the line and the amount available.  Any Offeror, who is given the rating of “fail”, will no longer be considered.
