Introduction
Document Purpose and Scope

This document describes the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) Critical Infrastructure Protection and Security (CIPS) to-be business process model for the personnel security business processes that will be supported by the CIPS Personnel Tracking System (PTS). The scope of the to-be business process model includes the following personnel security business processes:  Pre-Employment Screening  Determine Pre-Employment Suitability  Obtain On-Boarding Information  Process On-Boarding Request  Determine On-Boarding Requirements  Finalize On-Boarding Request  On-Board Personnel  Establish Candidate Suitability  Conduct Background Investigation  Issue OCC Credential  Issue National Security Clearance  Maintain Personnel  Conduct Reinvestigation  Replace OCC Credential  Update Personnel Information  Generate Reports  Grant National Security Clearance  Renew SmartID  Replace SmartID  Conduct Contractor Status Audit  Conduct Contractor Off-Boarding Audit  Off-Board Personnel  Complete CIPS Off-Boarding Tasks Other CIPS business processes (e.g., physical security and emergency security) will not be supported by the first release of CIPS PTS; therefore, these processes are outside the scope of this process model.

1.2

CIPS Project Background

CIPS plans to implement a new system, known as the CIPS PTS, to replace its collection of existing personnel security systems, improve business processes, and enhance data management. Today, CIPS uses a number of disconnected systems--

Version 2.0 June 11, 2009

CIPS Personnel Tracking System To-Be Personnel Security Business Processes Analysis

CIPS

Microsoft (MS) Excel, MS Access, and Lotus Notes-- to manage personnel security actions and information. The ad hoc and disconnected nature of these systems results in a number of problems, including: Weak Safeguards for PII The existing systems provide sufficient, but incomplete, safeguards for personally identifiable information (PII) as described in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-122 Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information. Redundant Data Entry Lack of automated interfaces between the existing systems causes redundant data entry, which results in an inefficient use of staff time and increases the likelihood of data errors. Lack of a Central Data Repository for Contractors The OCC does not currently have a central sys-tem of record for contractor information. The lack of this type of central database means that data routinely becomes out-of-sync between the current systems, which reduces data quality and increases the effort required to use the information. Labor-Intensive Reporting The disconnected nature of the existing systems results in manual data filtering, sorting, and aggregation to create reports. As a result, creating reports represents a significant work effort each month for CIPS staff. Reduced Focus on Security-Related Work The existing systems require a significant manual effort to complete tasks that are often automated in technologically advanced applications (e.g., data filtering to create meaningful reports). As a result, CIPS personnel are less focused on the core business of security. Inability to Meet Audit Requirements OCC's fiscal year (FY) 2007 independent financial audit resulted in a significant deficiency related to information technology (IT) controls. As part of that finding, auditors cited the need for the OCC to more effectively control the off-boarding process. Throughout FY 2008, OCC has been actively resolving this deficiency. CIPS PTS will contribute to the remediation by providing accountability for the off-boarding process.

1.3

Methodology

The CIPS PTS project team worked collaboratively with key project stakeholders to elicit, analyze, document, and validate the to-be personnel security business processes. The team gathered information about the business processes primarily through working sessions and interviews with the relevant business process owners and participants. The team also leveraged the knowledge gained during the development of the as-is business process model in building the to-be business process model. Specifically, while developing the as-is process model the team documented key areas for im-

CIPS

provement. This documentation allowed the project team to focus the to-be process discussions with stakeholders on previously identified issues. The project team also reviewed existing CIPS documentation as well as documentation on systems that may interface with CIPS PTS. Finally, the CIPS PTS project team applied best practices and industry standards that were not identified by project stakeholders directly, but that supported a robust solution using a modernized information system. The team used ITP Commerce's Process Modeler 5 for MS Visio to develop the business process flow diagrams. The notation and syntax for the process flow diagrams conforms to the Object Management Group's (OMG) Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) standard, version 1.1. It is important to note that BPMN leaves a number of choices to the discretion of the individual project. The project's standards for using BPMN are captured in Appendix B of this document. The to-be process model references an envisioned system along with a number of existing systems. For a brief description of each system, refer to Appendix D.

2.1

High-Level To-Be Business Process

The to-be business process model describes the business processes that CIPS PTS will perform to manage the personnel security life cycle of OCC employees and contractors. The high-level to-be business process diagram depicts a summarized view of the end-to-end personnel security business processes. Additional details are provided in subsequent sections of this document. 2.1.1 Subprocess 1 Conduct Pre-Employment Screening

CIPS plans to conduct pre-employment screening of potential employees at OCC's fall and spring recruiting events. Pre-employment screening will be used to establish a candidate's potential employment suitability before human resources (HR) provides an offer of employment. Suitability is determined through the use of a credit check, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal background check, and the resulting adjudication decision. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.2 below. 2.1.2 Subprocess 2 Obtain On-Boarding Information

CIPS PTS receives notice that a new employee or contractor has been hired. For employees, CIPS receives this notice through an on-boarding request submitted by HR. For contractors, CIPS receives on-boarding information through an on-boarding request submitted by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). CIPS PTS determines the on-boarding requirements for the new employee or contractor and updates the on-boarding request. A CIPS Personnel Security Technician reviews and finalizes the on-boarding request after it has been prepared, completed, and approved. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.4 below. 2.1.3 Subprocess 3 On-Board Personnel

Once CIPS approves a new employee or contractor on-boarding request, CIPS PTS will initiate the appropriate suitability and security background investigations. During this step, CIPS verifies the identity of the candidate, conducts an FBI criminal check and background investigation (if necessary), issues an OCC-issued security badge, and sends Information Technology Services (ITS) a notification stating the candidate's suitability for logical and physical access at the OCC. The Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 Issuer then issues a SmartID. The on-boarding subprocess also includes provisions to address several special employee classifications. For example, CIPS provides an OCC credential to employees hired for certain positions (e.g., bank examiners, attorneys, and CIPS staff). CIPS

CIPS

also issues a national security clearance (NSC) for employees hired for certain highly sensitive positions. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.8 below. 2.1.4 Subprocess 4 Maintain Personnel

CIPS maintains the personnel security records of employees and contractors throughout their tenure at the OCC. As part of personnel maintenance, CIPS is responsible for conducting reinvestigations, issuing replacement credentials, maintaining personnel profiles, generating reports for other OCC entities, granting NSCs, renewing and replacing SmartIDs, and conducting contractor audits. While some of these activities are scheduled to occur on a regular basis, others are ad hoc in nature and occur on an as-needed basis. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.19 below. 2.1.5 Subprocess 5 Off-Board Personnel

Before an employee or contractor leaves the OCC, CIPS PTS must receive an offboarding request from HR or the applicable COTR. Once CIPS PTS is notified of the departure, the system sends notifications to applicable individuals and representatives of OCC business units (e.g., Acquisition Management, Records Management, and Library Services). Designated OCC business units and individuals must complete off-boarding tasks for the separating employee or contractor. Each person assigned an off-boarding task must update the corresponding off-boarding record in CIPS PTS. As one of the business units responsible for completing off-boarding tasks, CIPS also completes specific off-boarding tasks for the departing employee or contractor, updating CIPS PTS as each task is completed. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.31 below.

Subprocess 1 Pre-Employment Screening

This subprocess describes the activities involved in pre-employment screening. As stated in section 2.1.1, CIPS plans to conduct pre-employment screening of potential employees at fall and spring recruiting events. Pre-employment screening is used to establish a potential candidate's employment suitability before HR extends an offer of employment. Suitability is determined through the use of a credit check, the FBI criminal background check, and the resulting adjudication decision. 2.2.1 Task 1.1 Complete Pre-Employment Screening Request

HR enters an employee pre-employment screening request via CIPS PTS, in some cases CIPS may enter an employee pre-employment screening request on behalf of HR. The request contains the employee's name, phone number, external e-mail address, PII (e.g., social security number [SSN], date of birth [DOB], place of birth [POB], and home address), position description, and resume. Refer to section 2.33.33 for additional details about the pre-employment screening request. 2.2.2 Task 1.2 Receive Pre-Employment Screening Request

CIPS PTS receives the employee pre-employment screening request. 2.2.3 Task 1.3 Provide Notification to Complete Pre-Employment Forms

CIPS PTS sends a notice to the candidate informing him to complete the preemployment screening forms in CIPS PTS. The notification contains instructions for completing the pre-employment forms and the candidate's temporary CIPS PTS user identifier (ID) and password. 2.2.4 Task 1.4 Complete Pre-Employment Forms

The candidate logs into CIPS PTS using his temporary CIPS PTS user ID and password and completes the Pre-Employment Criminal Records Release Form and the Pre-Employment Credit Authorization and Disclosure Form. Refer to section 2.33.31 for additional details about the Pre-Employment Criminal Records Release Form and section 2.33.32 for additional details about the Pre-Employment Credit Authorization and Disclosure Form. 2.2.5 Subprocess 1.5 Determine Pre-Employment Suitability

This subprocess describes the activities involved in conducting an FBI criminal check during the pre-employment screening process. A CIPS Personnel Security Technician captures the candidate's fingerprints and sends them to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM uses the information to conduct the FBI criminal check and provides the results to CIPS once the check is complete. Upon receipt, CIPS reviews the FBI criminal check results and adjudicates them either favorably or unfavorably.

A CIPS Personnel Security Technician captures the candidate's fingerprints and sends them to OPM. OPM uses the information to conduct the FBI criminal check and provides the results to CIPS once the check is complete. Upon receipt, CIPS reviews the FBI criminal check results and adjudicates them either favorably or unfavorably. 2.3.1 Task 1.5.1 Request Additional Pre-Employment Information

If necessary, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician contacts the candidate by phone to obtain any missing information from the pre-employment screening request or the pre-employment forms. 2.3.2 Task 1.5.2 Provide Required Pre-Employment Information

The candidate provides the CIPS Personnel Security Technician with the requested information. 2.3.3 Task 1.5.3 Record Additional Pre-Employment Information

The CIPS Personnel Security Technician updates CIPS PTS with new information provided by the candidate. 2.3.4 Task 1.5.4 Capture Candidate's Fingerprints

OPM requires a set of the candidate's fingerprints as a prerequisite to initiating an FBI criminal check. Using the Crossmatch system, a representative of CIPS captures the candidate's fingerprints and transmits them electronically to OPM. 2.3.5 Task 1.5.5 Provide a Complete Set of Fingerprints

A candidate provides a complete set of fingerprints to a representative of CIPS. 2.3.6 Task 1.5.6 Send Complete Set of Fingerprints

Using the Crossmatch system, a representative of CIPS electronically sends the candidate's fingerprints to OPM for processing. 2.3.7 Task 1.5.7 Record Date Fingerprints are Sent

A CIPS representative uses CIPS PTS to record the date and time when the candidate's fingerprints were sent to OPM. 2.3.8 Task 1.5.8 Process the Fingerprints in the FBI Criminal Check Record System

Subprocess 2 Obtain On-Boarding Information

This subprocess describes the activities involved in obtaining on-boarding information. As stated in section 2.1.2, CIPS PTS receives a notice that a new employee or contractor is to be on-boarded. For employees, CIPS receives this notice through an on-boarding request submitted by HR. For contractors, CIPS receives this notice through an on-boarding request submitted by the COTR. Using the information received, CIPS PTS determines the on-boarding requirements for the new employee or contractor and updates the on-boarding request. Once it is completed, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician reviews and finalizes the on-boarding request. 2.4.1 Task 2.1 Enter Employee On-Boarding Request

An HR Specialist enters an employee on-boarding request via CIPS PTS. The request contains the employee's name, phone number, external e-mail address, PII (e.g., SSN, DOB, and POB), position description, resume, anticipated employee start date, and the supervisor's name. Refer to section 2.33.12 for additional details about the employee on-boarding request. 2.4.2 Task 2.2 Enter Contractor On-Boarding Request

The COTR who will oversee the work of a new contractor enters a contractor onboarding request via CIPS PTS. The request contains the contractor's name, phone number, external e-mail address, company name, current or intended job location, contract number, task order number, COTR's name, contracting officer's (CO) name, anticipated contractor start date, and contract expiration date. At this point in the process, the COTR can opt to provide the OCC IT requirements and the physical work space requirements for the contractor; this information is not required at this stage of the process, but the data will be required before the request is approved. Refer to section 2.33.6 for additional details about the contractor on-boarding request. 2.4.3 Task 2.3 Send Notification to Complete On-Boarding Request

CIPS PTS sends a notice to the new contractor informing him to complete an onboarding request in CIPS PTS. The notification contains instructions for completing the on-boarding request, a brief overview of CIPS PTS, and the contractor's temporary CIPS PTS user ID and password. Refer to section 2.33.5 for details about the contractor on-boarding instructions. 2.4.4 Task 2.4 Complete Contractor On-Boarding Request

CIPS PTS sends a notice to the new contractor informing him to complete an onboarding request in CIPS PTS. The notification contains instructions for completing the on-boarding request and the contractor's temporary CIPS PTS user ID and

password. Refer to section 2.33.6 for details about the contractor on-boarding request. 2.4.5 Task 2.5 Send Notification to Complete Employee IT Access & Physical Space Requests

CIPS PTS sends the employee's supervisor a notification to complete employee IT access and physical work space requests. 2.4.6 Task 2.6 Complete Employee IT Access Request & Physical Space Requests

After receiving an automated notice from CIPS PTS, the supervisor completes IT access and physical work space requests for the new employee via CIPS PTS. The IT access request contains the OCC IT requirements for the new employee. 2.4.7 Task 2.7 Send Notification to Approve On-Boarding Request

CIPS PTS sends the COTR a notice that the contractor's on-boarding request has been completed in CIPS PTS and is awaiting the COTR's approval. 2.4.8 Task 2.8 Approve Contractor On-Boarding Request

After receiving an automated notice from CIPS PTS, the COTR reviews and approves the on-boarding request using CIPS PTS. Note that security provisions built into CIPS PTS will prevent the COTR from viewing the contractor's PII. If the COTR did not previously enter the OCC IT requirements and physical work space requirements (section 2.4.2), he now must enter that data in order to approve the on-boarding request. 2.4.9 Subprocess 2.9 Process On-Boarding Request

Once the employee or contractor on-boarding request has been submitted, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician reviews the on-boarding request to make sure it has been accurately completed and all the required information has been provided. After the on-boarding request has been reviewed, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician or Personnel Security Officer determines the candidate's eligibility through EVerify. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.5 below. 2.4.10 Subprocess 2.10 Determine On-Boarding Requirements

CIPS PTS uses the information from the on-boarding request and the position description to determine the on-boarding requirements for the new employee or contractor.

CIPS Personnel Tracking System To-Be Personnel Security Business Processes Analysis

CIPS

For a new employee, CIPS PTS determines if the new employee needs an OCC credential or an NSC, the level of IT access required, and any physical work space requirements. CIPS PTS uses the position information provided by HR to determine if an OCC credential or NSC is needed. CIPS PTS uses the information the employee's supervisor provided to determine the IT access requirements and physical work space requirements for the employee. For a new contractor, CIPS PTS determines if the new contractor needs IT access or a physical work space. CIPS PTS uses the information the COTR provided to determine the IT access requirements and physical work space requirements for the contractor. CIPS PTS transmits the IT access requirements to the Remedy system and the physical work space requirements to Real Estate & Capital Assets (RE&CA). Note that CIPS does not authorize access to OCC IT resources at this time; rather, the request for IT resources serves as an advance notice to Information Technology Services (ITS) of an upcoming requirement. Similarly, the notice sent to RE&CA is simply a notification of a pending requirement for physical work space. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.6 below. 2.4.11 Subprocess 2.11 Finalize On-Boarding Request

Once the employee's or contractor's on-boarding requirements have been determined, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician verifies the existence of a prior investigation for the employee or contractor. CIPS PTS uses the employee or contractor's investigation requirements along with any valid prior investigations to determine what type of investigation the OCC requires for an employee or contractor. If the new employee or contractor does not already have a Treasury Enterprise Directory Services (TEDS) ID, CIPS PTS assigns an OCC e-mail address and user principal name (UPN) to the new employee or contractor. Then CIPS PTS interfaces with TEDS to establish a TEDS ID for the new employee or contractor. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.7 below.

Subprocess 2.9 Process On-Boarding Request

This subprocess describes the activities involved in processing an on-boarding request. Once the employee or contractor on-boarding request has been submitted, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician reviews the on-boarding request to make sure it has been accurately completed and all the required information has been provided. After the on-boarding request has been reviewed a CIPS Personnel Security Technician or Personnel Security Officer determines the candidate's eligibility through E-Verify. 2.5.1 Task 2.9.1 Assign OCC E-mail Address and UPN

In order to complete the SmartID sponsorship task, CIPS needs to obtain the employee's or contractor's TEDS ID. Because TEDS needs an OCC e-mail address and UPN to generate a TEDS ID, CIPS PTS will assign an OCC e-mail address and UPN to the new employee or contractor. 2.5.2 Task 2.9.2 Review On-Boarding Request

A CIPS Personnel Security Technician uses CIPS PTS to review the completed onboarding request and confirms that all of the information needed to proceed with the on-boarding process is available. Based on this review, the CIPS Personnel Security Technician determines whether or not additional information is required from the employee or contractor. At this time, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician will also use the position description in the on-boarding request to designate a position sensitivity risk level. CIPS uses the position sensitivity risk level to determine the investigation requirements for the new employee or contractor. 2.5.3 Task 2.9.3 Request Additional On-Boarding Information

If necessary, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician contacts the employee or contractor by phone to obtain any missing information from the on-boarding request. The CIPS Personnel Security Technician may also request that the employee or contractor provide additional details regarding any prior background investigations that were previously conducted. 2.5.4 Task 2.9.4 Provide Required On-Boarding Information

The employee provides the CIPS Personnel Security Technician with the requested information. 2.5.5 Task 2.9.5 Provide Required On-Boarding Information

The contractor provides the CIPS Personnel Security Technician with the requested information.

The CIPS Personnel Security Technician or Personnel Security Officer records the candidate`s legal status in CIPS PTS. 2.5.9 Task 2.9.9 Determine Candidate's Eligibility

The CIPS Personnel Security Technician or Personnel Security Officer uses the information regarding the candidate's legal status to determine if the candidate is eligible for employment at the OCC. An employee must be a U.S. citizen to be eligible for employment at the OCC. In exceptional cases, HR may waive this requirement. A contractor must be either a U.S. citizen or a permanent legal resident to be eligible to work at the OCC. 2.5.10 Task 2.9.10 Send Notification of Candidate's Ineligibility

CIPS PTS sends a notification to HR or to the contractor's COTR informing him that the candidate is ineligible to work as an employee or contractor at the OCC. 2.5.11 Task 2.9.11 Receive Notification of Candidate's Ineligibility

HR or the COTR receive a notification informing him that the candidate is ineligible to work as an employee or contractor at the OCC.

Subprocess 2.10 Determine On-Boarding Requirements

CIPS PTS uses the information from the on-boarding request and the position description to determine the on-boarding requirements for the new employee or contractor. For a new employee, CIPS PTS determines if the new employee needs an OCC credential or an NSC, the level of IT access required, and any physical work space requirements. CIPS PTS uses the position information provided by HR to determine if an OCC credential or NSC is needed. CIPS PTS uses the information the employee's supervisor provided to determine the IT access requirements and physical work space requirements for the employee. For a new contractor, CIPS PTS uses the information provided by the COTR to determine the IT access requirements and physical work space requirements for the contractor. If IT access and/or physical space is required for the employee or contractor, CIPS PTS transmits the IT access requirements to the Remedy system and the physical work space requirements to RE&CA. Note that CIPS does not authorize access to OCC IT resources at this time; rather, the request for IT resources serves as an advance notice to ITS of an upcoming requirement. Similarly, the notice sent to RE&CA is simply a notification of a pending requirement for physical work space. 2.6.1 Task 2.10.1 Send Notification of Request for Physical Space

CIPS PTS sends a notification to RE&CA with physical space request information for the new employee or contractor. The notification includes all of the information submitted by the employee's supervisor or the contractor's COTR (e.g., sponsoring business unit, requested work space, work space type, location preference [OCC building name], and duration of space assignment). 2.6.2 Task 2.10.2 Receive Notification of Request for Physical Space

RE&CA receives the physical space request notification for the new employee or contractor. 2.6.3 Task 2.10.3 Add Employee to the Clearance Verification System File with an Interim Status

For an employee who requires an NSC, CIPS PTS adds the employee to the Clearance Verification System (CVS) file with an interim status, which indicates that the employee is currently going though the NSC issuance process. 2.6.4 Task 2.10.4 Send OCC Credential Request

For an employee who requires an OCC credential, CIPS PTS sends a credential request to the employee's OCC credential approver requesting the approval. The OCC

Subprocess 2.11 Finalize On-Boarding Request

This subprocess describes the activities involved in finalizing an on-boarding request. Once the employee's or contractor's on-boarding requirements have been determined, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician verifies the existence of a prior investigation for the employee or contractor. CIPS PTS uses the employee or contractor's investigation requirements along with any valid prior investigations to determine what type of investigation the OCC requires for an employee or contractor. If the new employee or contractor does not already have a TEDS ID, CIPS PTS interfaces with TEDS to establish a TEDS ID for the new employee or contractor. 2.7.1 Task 2.11.1 Verify Prior Investigations

A CIPS Personnel Security Technician accesses OPM's PIPS to verify the status and results of the employee's or contractor's prior investigations. PIPS provides information for investigations conducted by OPM; via a link to the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), it also provides information from investigations conducted by the Defense Security Services. If the candidate has a current investigation that meets the OCC's requirements, a background investigation and an FBI criminal check are not required. Otherwise, both a background investigation and an FBI criminal check will be performed. Both the background investigation and the criminal check will take place outside of CIPS PTS. 2.7.2 Task 2.11.2 Record Investigation Data

The CIPS Personnel Security Technician updates CIPS PTS with the current investigation status of the employee or contractor. 2.7.3 Task 2.11.3 Determine Type of Investigation Required

A suitability background investigation is required for all on-boarded employees and contractors with two exceptions. First, the investigation is not needed if the candidate has a previous suitability background investigation that meets or exceeds the OCC's requirements for the position. Second, while interns participating in the Student Temporary Employment Program (STEP) are required to undergo an FBI criminal check, they are not required to undergo a suitability background investigation using the e-QIP system. CIPS PTS uses the information from the on-boarding request and any additional information entered by a CIPS Personnel Security Technician to determine if an investigation is required. If an investigation is required, CIPS PTS will identify the type of investigation needed. 2.7.4 Task 2.11.4 Request TEDS ID

In order to complete the SmartID sponsorship task, CIPS needs to obtain the employee's or contractor's TEDS ID. CIPS PTS interfaces with TEDS to request a TEDS ID. At a minimum, CIPS PTS will provide the following data to TEDS: name,

Subprocess 3 On-Board Personnel

This subprocess describes the activities involved in on-boarding personnel. As discussed in section 2.1.3 above, during this subprocess CIPS verifies the identity of the candidate, conducts an FBI criminal check and background investigation (if necessary), issues an OCC-issued security badge, sends ITS a notification stating the candidate's suitability for logical and physical access at the OCC, and the HSPD-12 Issuer issues a SmartID. The on-boarding process also includes provisions to address several special employee classifications. For example, CIPS provides an OCC credential to employees hired for certain positions (e.g., bank examiners, attorneys, and CIPS staff). CIPS also obtains an NSC for employees hired for certain highly sensitive positions. 2.8.1 Subprocess 3.1 Establish Candidate Suitability

Several steps must be completed for a candidate to obtain both logical and physical access to OCC resources. An HSPD-12 Sponsor begins the process by sending the candidate's sponsorship data to GSA. CIPS uses an enrollment station to verify the candidate's identity and then records an imprint of the candidate's fingerprints for the FBI criminal background check. Once the results from the FBI criminal background check are received, CIPS adjudicates the results, records the results in CIPS PTS, and the HSPD-12 adjudicator enters the results into USAccess. If the adjudication is favorable, CIPS requests a SmartID for the candidate and CIPS PTS notifies ITS that access to OCC's systems is approved. After CIPS receives the SmartID from GSA, the candidate returns to CIPS for a badge appointment to receive both the OCC-issued security badge and the SmartID. If the adjudication is unfavorable, CIPS PTS sends a notification to either the employee's supervisor or the contractor's COTR that the FBI Criminal Check has been adjudicated unfavorably. Employees and contractors who are adjudicated unfavorably will not be granted OCC access. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.9 below. Refer to section 2.33.24 for details about the OCC-issued security badge and to section 2.33.34 for details about the SmartID. 2.8.2 Subprocess 3.2 Conduct Background Investigation

As discussed in section 2.7.3 above, nearly all employees and contractors must undergo a suitability background investigation using the e-QIP system as part of the on-boarding process. OCC interns participating in the STEP are required to undergo an FBI criminal check, but are not required to undergo a suitability background investigation using the e-QIP system. After determining the requirements, CIPS initiates the applicable suitability background investigation.

Operations Program Management Office

27

Version 2.0 June 11, 2009

CIPS Personnel Tracking System To-Be Personnel Security Business Processes Analysis

CIPS

OPM conducts the requested suitability background investigation and provides the results to CIPS. CIPS adjudicates those results either favorably or unfavorably. A candidate who receives an unfavorable adjudication will not be granted access to OCC's logical and physical resources. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.15 below. 2.8.3 Subprocess 3.3 Issue OCC Credential

Employees hired for certain OCC positions--for example, bank examiners, attorneys, and CIPS staff--require an OCC credential to identify themselves as OCC, Treasury Department, or federal employees in the course of performing their official duties. These duties may include conducting agency-related travel, gaining entrance to bank facilities, and otherwise conveying authority to perform official OCC business. CIPS is responsible for issuing OCC credentials. Certain OCC personnel are designated as OCC credential approvers. One of these designated approvers uses CIPS PTS to authorize an employee's OCC credential. After receiving authorization, the CIPS Personnel Security Officer prints and assembles the OCC credential, and then obtains the employee's approval to place his signature on the OCC credential card. Once complete, the Personnel Security Officer sends the signed OCC credential to the employee and updates CIPS PTS. Upon receipt, the employee uses CIPS PTS to acknowledge that he received the OCC credential. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.17 below. Refer to section 2.33.19 for additional details on the OCC credential. 2.8.4 Subprocess 3.4 Issue National Security Clearance

CIPS is responsible for issuing national security clearances to OCC employees hired for certain highly sensitive positions. After the applicable security and suitability background investigations are completed, CIPS PTS will automatically provide the employee with the required NSC forms and briefing materials. The employee uses CIPS PTS to complete the required NSC documents. Once the employee completes the required NSC information, the CIPS Personnel Security Officer issues the employee's NSC and updates the employee's record in CIPS PTS. CIPS PTS will then automatically change the employee's NSC status from interim to final on the CVS file to reflect that CIPS granted the NSC. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.18 below. Refer to section 2.33.18 for additional details on the NSC packet.

Subprocess 3.1 Establish Candidate Suitability

This subprocess describes the activities involved in establishing suitability for new personnel. As discussed in section 2.8.1 above, several steps are required before a candidate is deemed to have met OCC's suitability requirements. An HSPD-12 Sponsor begins the process by sending the candidate's sponsorship data to GSA. The HSPD-12 Registrar uses a USAccess enrollment station, which is outside of CIPS PTS, to verify the candidate's identity and then records an imprint of the candidate's fingerprints. A Personnel Security Technician also uses Crossmatch to record an imprint of the candidate's fingerprints for the FBI criminal background check. Once the results from the FBI criminal background check are received, CIPS adjudicates the results, records them in CIPS PTS, and sends a copy of the results to GSA. If the adjudication was favorable, CIPS requests a SmartID for the candidate, and CIPS PTS notifies ITS that the candidate has met OCC's suitability requirements. After CIPS receives the SmartID from GSA, the candidate returns for a badge appointment to receive both the OCC-issued security badge and the SmartID. If the adjudication is unfavorable, CIPS PTS sends a notification to either the employee's supervisor or the contractor's COTR that the FBI Criminal Check has been adjudicated unfavorably. Employees and contractors who are adjudicated unfavorably will not be granted OCC access. Refer to section 2.33.24 for details about the OCC-issued security badge and to section 2.33.34 for details about the SmartID. 2.9.1 Task 3.1.1 Task 3.1.1 Send HSPD-12 Sponsorship Data

After the candidate has satisfactorily submitted the required background investigation forms via OPM's Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (eQIP) system, CIPS PTS notifies an HSPD-12 Sponsor to send the candidate's HSPD-12 sponsorship data to USAccess, GSA's card provisioning system. 2.9.2 Task 3.1.2 Receive HSPD-12 Sponsorship Data

GSA receives the candidate's HSPD-12 sponsorship data. 2.9.3 Subprocess 3.1.3 Verify Personal Identity at OCC Enrollment Station

After CIPS sends the candidate's HSPD-12 sponsorship data to GSA, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician authorizes the OCC security appointment. After the OCC security appointment has been authorized the employee is notified to schedule the security appointment with CIPS. For contractors, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician notifies the COTR that the OCC security appointment has been authorized and should be scheduled with CIPS.

CIPS

At the OCC security appointment, an HSPD-12 Registrar verifies the candidate's identity by examining two forms of ID that meet the requirements of Form I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification. An HSPD-12 Registrar captures the candidate's fingerprints and photograph for the SmartID at the OCC enrollment station and sends them to GSA for creation of the SmartID. Once complete, a CIPS physical security employee uses C*Cure to capture the candidate's photograph for the OCC-issued security badge. For employees, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician also captures a digital image of the employee's signature via CIPS PTS. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.10 below. 2.9.4 Subprocess 3.1.4 Verify Personal Identity at Non-OCC Enrollment Station

After CIPS sends the candidate's HSPD-12 sponsorship data to GSA, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician authorizes the OCC security appointment. After the OCC security appointment has been authorized the employee is notified to schedule the security appointment with CIPS. For contractors, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician notifies the COTR that the OCC security appointment has been authorized and should be scheduled with CIPS. The OCC security appointment can be conducted either at a location with or without an OCC enrollment station. If the appointment occurs at an office without an OCC enrollment station (e.g., some district offices), the candidate is also required to schedule a second appointment at a location that has a USAccess enrollment station. At the OCC security appointment, a CIPS physical security employee uses C*Cure to capture the candidate's photograph for the OCC-issued security badge. For employees, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician also captures a digital image of the employee's signature via CIPS PTS. At the appointment with the non-OCC enrollment station, an HSPD-12 Registrar verifies the candidate's identity by examining two forms of ID that meet the requirements. The HSPD-12 Registrar then uses the non-OCC enrollment station to capture the candidate's fingerprints and photograph for the SmartID, and then sends them to GSA who creates the SmartID. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.11 below. 2.9.5 Subprocess 3.1.5 Conduct FBI Criminal Check

If CIPS determines that an FBI criminal check is required, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician captures the candidate's fingerprints and then sends them to OPM. OPM uses the information to conduct the FBI criminal check and provides the re-

CIPS

Prior to submission, the candidate must correct any issues identified with the PSQ. PSQ issues are identified in one of two ways: either the e-QIP application itself, which is capable of flagging omissions of required information, or by CIPS staff, who identify data inconsistencies and other potential PSQ concerns. In instances where the candidate submitted the investigation data to the OCC and CIPS identified that the data was incomplete, the candidate will correct the identified issues and re-submit the investigation data to the OCC. 2.15.8 Task 3.2.8 Complete and Submit All Other Applicable Forms

In addition to completing the PSQ, each candidate is responsible for completing several other forms that are either available within e-QIP or CIPS PTS. Contractors must complete and sign the following forms:  General and medical release forms in e-QIP  Fair Credit Report Act Disclosure and Authorization  OF-306 Declaration for Federal Employment Employees must complete and sign the following forms:  General and medical release forms in e-QIP  Fair Credit Report Act Disclosure and Authorization Employees and contractors complete and submit the Fair Credit Report Act Disclosure and Authorization and OF-306 Declaration for Federal Employment via CIPS PTS. Employees and contractors complete and sign the general and medical release forms via e-QIP. Refer to section 2.33.13 for details about the Fair Credit Report Act Disclosure and Authorization and to section 2.33.8 for details about the Declaration for Federal Employment. 2.15.9 Task 3.2.9 Submit Investigation Data

2.17 Subprocess 3.3 Issue OCC Credential
This subprocess describes the activities involved in issuing an OCC credential. As discussed in section 2.8.3 above, employees hired for certain OCC positions--for example, bank examiners, attorneys, and CIPS staff--require an official OCC credential to identify themselves as OCC, Treasury Department, or federal employees in the course of performing their duties. These duties may include conducting agencyrelated travel, gaining entrance to bank facilities, and otherwise conveying authority to perform official OCC business. CIPS is responsible for issuing OCC credentials. Certain OCC personnel are designated as OCC credential approvers. One of these designated approvers uses CIPS PTS to authorize issuance of an employee's OCC credential. After receiving authorization, the CIPS Personnel Security Officer prints and assembles the OCC credential, and then obtains the employee's approval to place his signature on the OCC credential card. Once complete, the Personnel Security Officer sends the signed OCC credential to the employee and updates CIPS PTS. Upon receipt, the employee uses CIPS PTS to acknowledge that he received the OCC credential. Refer to section 2.33.19 for additional details about the OCC credential. 2.17.1 Task 3.3.1 Send Approved OCC Credential Request

The OCC credential approver logs into CIPS PTS to review and approve an OCC credential approval request. 2.17.2 Task 3.3.2 Receive Approved OCC Credential Request

CIPS PTS sends the CIPS Personnel Security Officer a notification that an approved OCC credential request has been received. Refer to section 2.33.23 for details about the OCC credential request. 2.17.3 Task 3.3.3 Create OCC Credential Card

The CIPS Personnel Security Officer uses CIPS PTS to create the OCC credential card. The CIPS Personnel Security Officer selects the appropriate OCC credential category and applies the digital image of the employee's signature to the card. 2.17.4 Task 3.3.4 Send Notification to Review OCC Credential Card

CIPS PTS sends a notification to the employee to review the image of the OCC credential card and approve the use of his signature on the OCC credential card. To protect the integrity of the process, the employee's view of the OCC credential card in CIPS PTS will be overlaid with a watermark and will not bear the Comptroller's signature. Refer to section 2.33.21 for additional details on the OCC credential card acknowledgement.

2.18 Subprocess 3.4 Issue National Security Clearance
This subprocess describes the activities involved in issuing a national security clearance. As stated in section 2.8.4, CIPS is responsible for issuing national security clearances to OCC employees hired for certain highly sensitive positions. After the applicable security and suitability background investigations are completed, CIPS PTS will automatically provide the employee with the required NSC forms and briefing materials. The employee uses CIPS PTS to complete the required NSC documents. Once the employee completes the required NSC information, the CIPS Personnel Security Officer issues the employee's NSC and updates the employee's record in CIPS PTS. CIPS PTS will then automatically change the employee's NSC status from interim to final on the CVS file to reflect that CIPS granted the NSC. 2.18.1 Task 3.4.1 Send National Security Clearance Packet

Once the employee's background investigation is approved, CIPS PTS provides an NSC packet to the employee containing a classified Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and an NSC briefing. Refer to section 2.33.18 for additional details about the NSC packet. 2.18.2 Task 3.4.2 Complete National Security Clearance Packet

The employee uses CIPS PTS to read and sign the classified NDA. The employee also completes the NSC briefing and signs the NSC briefing certificate in CIPS PTS. 2.18.3 Task 3.4.3 Receive Completed National Security Clearance Packet

CIPS PTS is updated to reflect that the employee completed the required actions on the items within the NSC packet. At this point, the employee is allowed to perform work with an interim NSC until the security and suitability background investigations are completed and favorably adjudicated. 2.18.4 Task 3.4.4 Finalize National Security Clearance

After the security and suitability background investigations are completed and favorably adjudicated, the CIPS Personnel Security Officer confirms that the NSC packet was completed correctly. Then the CIPS Personnel Security Officer grants the employee's NSC. CIPS PTS then sends the employee an email stating that the final NSC has been granted. 2.18.5 Task 3.4.5 Receive Notification of an Approved National Security Clearance

2.19 Subprocess 4 Maintain Personnel
This subprocess describes the activities involved in maintaining personnel security records. As discussed in section 2.1.4 above, CIPS maintains the personnel security records of employees and contractors throughout their tenure at the OCC. As part of personnel maintenance, CIPS is responsible for conducting reinvestigations, issuing replacement credentials, maintaining personnel profiles, generating reports for other OCC entities, granting NSCs, renewing and replacing SmartIDs, and conducting contractor audits. While some of these activities are scheduled to occur on a regular basis, others are ad hoc in nature and occur on an as-needed basis. 2.19.1 Subprocess 4.1 Conduct Reinvestigation

CIPS conducts reinvestigations for existing employees and contractors on an ongoing basis. To facilitate the process, CIPS PTS analyzes the current investigation data to automatically determine when individuals need to be reinvestigated. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.20 below. 2.19.2 Subprocess 4.2 Replace OCC Credential

CIPS may replace an existing OCC credential for several reasons. When a credentialed employee is promoted, the employee may require an updated OCC credential to reflect the change. In these cases, the applicable approver submits an approved OCC credential request in CIPS PTS to request the replacement OCC credential. CIPS may also replace an OCC credential that has been damaged. In this case, the employee will submit a request for a replacement OCC credential. When a credentialed employee loses his credential, or when the OCC credential is stolen, the employee must file a police report in addition to requesting a replacement OCC credential. In all cases involving OCC credential replacement, the CIPS Personnel Security Officer processes the request and sends a replacement OCC credential to the employee. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.21 below. 2.19.3 Subprocess 4.3 Update Personnel Information

CIPS is responsible for providing both standard and ad hoc reports to address authorized requests for information. Registered CIPS PTS users use the system to generate standard reports. When an existing standard report will not satisfy a user's needs, after validating the necessary approvals a CIPS Personnel Security Technician generates and sends an ad hoc report to address the requirements. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.22 below.

CIPS

CIPS is responsible for providing both standard and ad hoc reports to address authorized requests for information. CIPS PTS users use the system to select and generate existing reports. When an existing report will not satisfy a user's needs, after validating the necessary approvals a CIPS Personnel Security Technician generates an ad hoc report to address the requirements. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.23 below. 2.19.5 Subprocess 4.5 Grant National Security Clearance

Changes in an existing employee's position description number signaling a change in job requirements may necessitate a new or upgraded NSC. CIPS and the employee must complete the necessary actions to obtain a new or upgraded NSC. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.24 below. 2.19.6 Subprocess 4.6 Renew SmartID

All SmartIDs must be renewed every five years. To facilitate the renewal process, CIPS PTS performs a daily check of all active employee and contractor records for SmartIDs that are nearing the end of the five year period. When six months or less remain until expiration, CIPS PTS sends the appropriate employees and contractors a notice to schedule a SmartID renewal appointment. After receiving the notice, the impacted personnel schedule the appointment. An HSPD-12 Sponsor sends the employee's or contractor's sponsorship data to GSA. The employee or contractor travels to an OCC enrollment station or a non-OCC enrollment station to have his identity verified and his fingerprints and photograph captured by the HSPD-12 Registrar. The HSPD-12 Registrar sends the fingerprints and photograph to GSA who produces the SmartID and sends it to CIPS. After receiving a notice that the SmartID is available, the employee or contractor travels to the CIPS office or nearest district office to pick it up, and then uses a SmartID activation station to complete the process. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.25 below. 2.19.7 Subprocess 4.7 Replace SmartID

SmartIDs may be replaced if lost, damaged, or stolen. To start the replacement process, the employee or contractor uses CIPS PTS to enter a SmartID replacement request. Upon receipt of the replacement request, an HSPD-12 Security Officer or HSPD-12 Sponsor deactivates the current SmartID, and CIPS PTS sends an e-mail to the employee or contractor, stating that an appointment must be scheduled to replace the SmartID.

After receiving a notice that the SmartID is available, the employee or contractor travels to the CIPS office or nearest district office to pick to up, and then uses a SmartID activation station to complete the process. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.28 below. 2.19.8 Subprocess 4.8 Conduct Contractor Status Audit

CIPS PTS sends each COTR a list of his active contractors. The COTR verifies that all of the contractors on his list are still working under him and that information for each contractor is correct in CIPS PTS. The Personnel Security Officer reviews any changes the COTRs made to the lists and acknowledges all updates in CIPS PTS. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.29 below. 2.19.9 Subprocess 4.9 Conduct Contractor Off-Boarding Audit

CIPS PTS determines which contractors are still in the system with an active status but have contract expiration dates that have already occurred. CIPS PTS sends a notification to each COTR that is assigned a contractor whose contract expiration date has passed instructing the COTR to submit an off-boarding request the contractor. The Personnel Security Officer also reviews the list of contractors who require off-boarding and determines if an additional action is required. This subprocess is further decomposed and explained in section 2.30 below.

2.20 Subprocess 4.1 Conduct Reinvestigation
This subprocess describes the activities involved in conducting a reinvestigation. As discussed in section 2.19.1 above, CIPS PTS maintains investigation information for all employees and contractors. On a daily basis, CIPS PTS analyzes this information to automatically determine when individuals need to be reinvestigated. Each employee and contractor is assigned a position-based risk rating that drives the reinvestigation timeframe requirement. Personnel filling positions designated as high risk are reinvestigated every five years, personnel in moderate-risk positions are reinvestigated every ten years, and personnel filling low-risk positions are reinvestigated every fifteen years. CIPS PTS evaluates the relevant risk data and prior investigation completion information to automatically identify employees and contractors for reinvestigation. 2.20.1 Task 4.1.1 Send Out Reinvestigation Notification

CIPS PTS sends an e-mail to employees and contractors' COTRs who require a reinvestigation stating that a reinvestigation appointment must be scheduled. 2.20.2 Task 4.1.2 Schedule Reinvestigation

After receiving the reinvestigation notice, the employee or COTR schedules a reinvestigation appointment. 2.20.3 Task 4.1.3 Record Reinvestigation Appointment

The Personnel Security Technician records the date and time of the reinvestigation appointment in CIPS PTS. Once the reinvestigation is scheduled and recorded in CIPS PTS, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician proceeds to process step 3.2.1 in the conduct investigation process flow (refer to section 2.15) and process step 3.1.5.1 in the conduct FBI criminal check process flow (refer to section 2.12).

2.23 Subprocess 4.4 Generate Reports
This subprocess describes the activities involved in generating recurring and ad hoc personnel security reports for CIPS PTS users. As discussed in section 2.19.4 above, CIPS is responsible for providing both standard and ad hoc reports to address authorized requests for information. CIPS PTS users use the system to select and receive standard reports. When an existing standard report will not satisfy a user's needs, after validating the necessary approvals a CIPS Personnel Security Technician generates an ad hoc report to address the requirements. 2.23.1 Task 4.4.1 Request Report

A registered CIPS user can select a report directly from a list of standard reports in CIPS PTS. Reports that are not in the list of standard CIPS PTS reports can be requested as ad hoc reports. Requests for ad hoc reports are handled outside of CIPS PTS. 2.23.2 Task 4.4.2 Receive Report Request

CIPS PTS receives a report request from a CIPS PTS user. In the case of a standard report, this request is for the report that the CIPS PTS user selected. In the case of an ad hoc report, a CIPS Personnel Security Technician receives the ad hoc report request directly from the CIPS PTS user. 2.23.3 Task 4.4.3 Approve Ad Hoc Report

If the user requests an ad hoc report, the CIPS Personnel Security Technician will review the request and determine the feasibility of generating the ad hoc report. If the CIPS Personnel Security Technician can create the report, and if the CIPS Personnel Security Technician determines that the report does not violate CIPS reporting rules, the CIPS Personnel Security Technician generates the ad hoc report. 2.23.4 Task 4.4.4 Create Ad Hoc Report

The CIPS Personnel Security Technician creates an ad hoc report in CIPS PTS to meet the user's ad hoc report request. 2.23.5 Task 4.4.5 Send Ad Hoc Report

This subprocess describes the activities involved in granting a national security clearance to appropriate OCC employees. As discussed in section 2.19.5 above, changes in an existing employee's position description number signaling a change in job requirements may necessitate a new or upgraded NSC. CIPS and the employee must complete the necessary actions to obtain a new or upgraded NSC. 2.24.1 Task 4.5.1 Add Employee to the Clearance Verification File with Interim Status

After a change in an employee's position description that results in the need for a NSC has been received, CIPS PTS adds the employee to the CVS file with an interim status. The interim status indicates that the employee is currently going though the clearance process. 2.24.2 Task 4.5.2 Review All Prior Investigations for the Employee

CIPS reviews the employee's prior background investigations to determine if the employee has a current investigation that meets the requirements for a NSC. If CIPS determines that a new investigation is needed the process continues with steps 3.1.5.1 in the conduct FBI criminal check process flow and 3.2.1 in conduct background investigation process flow, then continues to step 3.4.1 in the issue NSC process flow in section 2.18.1 above. If CIPS determines that a previous investigation meets the requirements to issue an NSC, no additional investigations are required. In this case, the process continues with step 3.4.1 in the issue NSC process flow in section 2.18.1 above.

2.25 Subprocess 4.6 Renew SmartID
This subprocess describes the activities involved in renewing an existing SmartID. As discussed in section 2.19.6 above, all SmartIDs must be renewed every five years. To facilitate the renewal process, CIPS PTS performs a daily check of all active employee and contractor records for SmartIDs that are nearing the end of the five-year validity period. When six months or less remain until expiration of the ID, CIPS PTS sends the appropriate employees and contractors' COTRs a notice to schedule a SmartID renewal appointment. After receiving the notice, the impacted personnel schedule the appointment. An HSPD-12 Sponsor sends the employee's or contractor's sponsorship data to GSA. The employee or contractor travels to an OCC enrollment station or a non-OCC enrollment station to have his identity verified and his fingerprints and photograph captured by the HSPD-12 Registrar. The HSPD-12 Registrar sends the fingerprints and photograph to GSA who produces the SmartID and sends it to CIPS. After receiving a notice that the SmartID is available, the employee or contractor travels to the CIPS office or nearest district office to pick to up, and then uses a SmartID activation station to complete the process. Refer to section 2.33.34 for additional details about the SmartID. 2.25.1 Task 4.6.1 Send Notification to Schedule SmartID Renewal Appointment

CIPS PTS sends a notification to schedule a SmartID renewal appointment to an employee or contractor who has six months or less remaining before the SmartID expiration date. The notification includes a reminder that the SmartID will expire if it is not renewed. 2.25.2 Task 4.6.2 Schedule SmartID Renewal Appointment

2.31 Subprocess 5 Off-Board Personnel
This subprocess describes the activities involved in off-boarding employees and contractors. As discussed in section 2.1.5 above, before an employee or contractor leaves the OCC, CIPS PTS must receive off-boarding information or an off-boarding request from HR or the applicable COTR. Once CIPS PTS is notified of the departure, the system automatically sends notifications to applicable individuals and representatives of OCC business units (e.g., Acquisition Management, Records Management, and Library Services). Designated OCC business units and individuals are notified of when an employee or contractor is off-boarding. Each person assigned an off-boarding task updates the corresponding off-boarding record in CIPS PTS. As one of the business units responsible for completing off-boarding tasks, CIPS also updates CIPS PTS as it completes its own tasks for the departing employee or contractor. 2.31.1 Task 5.1 Send Employee Off-Boarding Request

An employee who is leaving the OCC or his supervisor should submit an OCC notification of separation in HRConnect. The information in HRConnect is captured in HRHub. HRHub sends the employee's off-boarding notification directly to CIPS PTS in the form of an employee off-boarding request. Alternatively, an HR Specialist can enter the employee off-boarding request directly into CIPS PTS. This request includes the employee's separation date, office location, e-mail address, and the supervisor's name. Refer to section 2.33.11 for details about the employee off-boarding request. 2.31.2 Task 5.2 Enter Contractor Off-Boarding Request

The COTR of a contractor who is leaving the OCC should submit a contractor offboarding request in CIPS PTS. This form includes the contractor's separation date, office location, e-mail address, the COTR's e-mail address, and the CO's e-mail address. Refer to section 2.33.4 for details about the contractor off-boarding request. 2.31.3 Task 5.3 Receive Off-Boarding Request

CIPS PTS receives requests for off-boarding employees from HRHub or an HR Specialist and receives requests for off-boarding contractors from the COTR. 2.31.4 Task 5.4 Send Off-Boarding Notification

CIPS PTS automatically sends e-mails to notify all of the applicable parties that their assigned off-boarding tasks must be completed prior to the employee's or contractor's departure from the OCC.

Appendix B BPMN Notation and Project-Specific Usage
BPMN Notation The table below displays the BPMN diagram symbols and descriptions used in this document. Table B­1 To-Be Process Model Symbol Set
Symbol Definition This symbol represents a start event. The start event indicates where in the pool a process will start. This means that there are multiple ways of triggering the process. Only one of them will be required to start the process. The attributes of the start event will define which of the other types of triggers apply. A message arrives from a participant and triggers the start of the process. A specific time-date or a specific cycle (e.g., every Monday at 9 a.m.) can be set that will trigger the start of the process. This symbol represents an intermediate event. Intermediate events occur between a start event and an end event. This is an event that occurs after a process has been started. It will affect the flow of the process but will not start or directly terminate the process. This type of event can only be attached to the boundary of an activity, thus it reacts to (catches) a named error, or to any error if a name is not specified. This type of event is triggered when a condition becomes true. This type of event is used for sending or receiving signals. A signal is for general communication within and across process levels, across pools, and between business process diagrams. A BPMN signal is similar to a signal flare shot into the sky for anyone who might be interested to notice and then react. Thus, there is a source of the signal, but no specific intended target. This is different than a BPMN message, which has a specific source and a specific target. A message arrives from a participant and triggers the event. This causes the process to continue if it was waiting for the message, or changes the flow for exception handling. When used to "catch" the message, then the event marker will be unfilled. In normal flow, message intermediate events can be used for sending messages to a participant. When used to "throw" the message, the event marker will be filled (see bottom figure on the right) If used for exception handling it will change the normal flow into an exception flow.

and

Definition This symbol represents a terminator or end. The end event indicates where in the pool the process will end. These symbols represent the process start and end events. The start event indicates where the overall process will start. The end event indicates where the overall process ends. This type of end indicates that all activities in the Process should be immediately ended. This includes all instances of multi-instances. The process is ended compensation or event handling. This symbol represents a task. A task is an atomic activity that is included within a process. A task is used when the work in the process is not broken down to a finer level of detail. This symbol represents a collapsed subprocess. A subprocess is a compound activity that is included within a process. It is compound in that it is broken down into finer detail through a set of tasks. The details of the subprocess are not visible in the diagram. This symbol represents a completely automated task.

This symbol represents a non-automated task.

This is a data object. Data objects are considered artifacts because they do not have any direct impact on the sequence flow or message flow of the process but they do provide information about what the process does. This represents a sequence flow. A sequence flow is used to show the order that activities will be performed in a process. A sequence flow that has a gateway or an activity as its source can also be defined with a condition expression of default. Such sequence flow will have a marker to show that it is a default flow. This is a message flow. A message flow is used to show the flow of messages between two entities (pools) that are prepared to send and receive them.

This is an association. An association is used to associate information with flow objects. Text and graphical nonflow objects can be associated with the flow objects.

Definition This is a text annotation. Text annotations are used to provide additional information for the reader of a BPMN diagram. This is a pool. A pool is a graphical container for partitioning a set of activities from other pools.

This is a lane. A lane is a sub-partition within a pool and will extend the entire length of the pool. Lanes are used to organize and categorize activities within a pool.

This is a gateway. A gateway is used to control the divergence and convergence of sequence flow. It determines branching, forking, merging, and joining of paths.

An exclusive gateway is a "fork in the road" where there are two or more alternative paths. Only one of the possible outgoing paths can be taken when the process is performed. An inclusive gateway is used for decisions where there is more than one possible outcome. One or more of the possible outgoing paths can be taken when the process is performed. All of the selected outgoing paths must be completed before the process continues. A parallel gateway is used to depict multiple parallel paths in a process. With a parallel gateway, all of the possible outgoing paths are taken when the process is performed. All of the parallel paths must be completed before the process continues. A complex gateway is used for forking and merging decisions that cannot be represented by using an exclusive, inclusive, or parallel gateway.

CIPS Personnel Tracking System To-Be Personnel Security Business Processes Analysis CIPS PTS Project-Specific BPMN Usage and Decisions

CIPS

BPMN leaves a number of usage choices to the project's discretion. The following list outlines some of the more prominent usage choices made in documenting the processes shown in this document.  Subprocesses will be used to provide a leveled structure to the process diagrams. Subprocesses and proper leveling allow the complexity of any diagram to be controlled by capturing lower-level details further down in the diagram hierarchy.  Tasks will be named using short, simple phrases that attempt to accurately reflect the activity performed. The narrative associated with the task will convey details that are not included in the name.  Each subprocess will be composed of tasks that will be used to represent the lowest level of detail presented in the each diagram.  Business units and distinct groups of actors have been modeled as separate pools, rather than modeling the OCC as a single pool with multiple swim lanes for business units and distinct groups of actors. This imposes a process flow constraint (i.e., process flows cannot move between business units or groups of actors) and a message flow constraint (i.e., messages can only flow between business units and groups of actors) throughout the business model that makes the overall model easier to understand.  If a system is used to perform a significant portion of any task, the system name will be identified within square brackets inside the relevant process shape.  In many process modeling efforts, the drive for simplicity often leads to parallel activities being shown sequentially. Care will be taken to accurately depict parallel activities.  A gear icon will be used to identify tasks that are largely or wholly performed without human intervention.  Data objects will be displayed as associated to sequence or message flow (i.e., as opposed to being associated with tasks). Data objects are not explicitly shown when the data flow follows the sequence flow in an unambiguous way.  All splitting gateways will terminate with a corresponding merging gateway.  Exclusive gateways will display an "X" inside the gateway symbol, as opposed to an empty symbol, which is also allowed by the BPMN standard.  All signal and error events will include an annotation briefly describing the event.  All conditional events will include a brief description of the condition(s) evaluated.  All process flows will pass the validations enforced by the ITP Commerce Modeler software.

CIPS

Appendix D Supporting Systems
The following systems are referenced in the to-be process model and are expected to support the future personnel security business processes. Table D­1 Supporting Systems
System Name C*Cure Crossmatch ECI e-QIP E-Verify System Description C*Cure is used to program and print OCC-issued security badges, encode physical access panels, and monitor personnel entry into and exit from secured areas. Crossmatch is used to capture fingerprint images and transmit them to OPM as part of the investigation process. ECI is a data fusion point for employee contact information. e-QIP is an OPM system used to initiate and collect information for background investigations. E-Verify is an Internet based system operated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in partnership with the Social Security Administration (SSA) that allows participating employers to electronically verify the current legal status of their newly hired employees. HRHub is the data warehouse that stores data from HRConnect for access by external applications. PIPS is an OPM application used to verify the status of investigations. Remedy is an OCC system used to track a variety of IT requests. CIPS uses Remedy to review and close employee and contractor requests for access to IT resources. USAccess was developed to be a shared end-to-end solution for issuing Personal Identity Verification (PIV) or "SmartID" cards as mandated by HSPD-12. The GSA MSO USAccess program allows civilian agencies and commissions to share a common identity management infrastructure for the issuance of HSPD-12 compliant credentials. TEDS provides a central repository for Treasury employees and contractors that contain names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and E-Authentication digital certificates. Centralization is made possible by connecting disparate directory sources from the various Treasury Bureaus, who maintain their own information, into one comprehensive directory. In this manner, TEDS serves as the authoritative source of directory information for the entire Treasury. TEDS has been chosen as an integral part of HSPD-12 and therefore will be upgraded to provide continued vendor support.

Introduction
Document Purpose and Scope

This document describes the functional requirements for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) Critical Infrastructure Protection and Security (CIPS) Personnel Tracking System (PTS). The scope of this document is limited to the functional requirements that will support the CIPS personnel security business processes. Non-functional requirements (e.g., technical requirements, security requirements, audit trail requirements, performance requirements, and detailed reporting requirements) are captured in the CIPS PTS supplementary requirements document.

1.2
1.2.1

CIPS Project Background
Business Need

CIPS plans to implement a new system, known as CIPS PTS, to replace its collection of existing systems, improve business processes, and enhance data management. Today, CIPS uses a number of disconnected systems--Microsoft (MS) Excel, MS Access, and Lotus Notes databases--to manage security actions. The ad hoc and disconnected nature of these systems results in a number of problems, including: Weak Safeguards for PII The existing systems provide sufficient, but incomplete, safeguards for personally identifiable information (PII) as described in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-122 Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information. Redundant Data Entry Lack of automated interfaces between the existing systems causes redundant data entry, which results in an inefficient use of staff time and increases the likelihood of data errors. Lack of a Central Data Repository The OCC does not currently have a central system of record for contractor information. The lack of this type of central database means that data routinely becomes out-of-sync between the current systems, which reduces data quality and increases the effort required to use the information. Labor-Intensive Reporting The disconnected nature of the existing systems results in manual data filtering, sorting, and aggregation to create reports. As a result, creating reports represents a significant work effort each month for CIPS staff.

CIPS Personnel Tracking System Functional Requirements

CIPS

Reduced Focus on Security-Related Work The existing systems require a significant manual effort to complete tasks that are often automated in technologically advanced applications (e.g., data filtering to create meaningful reports). As a result, CIPS personnel are less focused on the core business of security. Inability to Meet Audit Requirements OCC's fiscal year (FY) 2007 independent financial audit resulted in a significant deficiency related to information technology (IT) controls. As part of that finding, auditors cited the need for the OCC to more effectively control the off-boarding process. Throughout FY 2008, OCC has been actively resolving this deficiency. CIPS PTS will contribute to the remediation by providing accountability for the off-boarding process. 1.2.2 System Scope

The scope for the first release of CIPS PTS includes the system features necessary to support the following personnel security business processes and subprocesses. Refer to the to-be business processes analysis for more information about these processes.  Obtain on-boarding information  Process on-boarding request  Determine on-boarding requirements  Finalize on-boarding request  On-board personnel  Establish candidate suitability  Conduct background investigation  Issue OCC credential  Issue national security clearance  Maintain personnel  Conduct reinvestigation  Replace OCC credential  Update personnel information  Generate reports  Grant national security clearance  Renew SmartID  Replace SmartID  Conduct contractor status audit  Conduct contractor off-boarding audit  Off-board personnel  Complete CIPS off-boarding tasks System features to support other CIPS business processes (e.g., physical security and emergency security) are outside the scope of the first release of CIPS PTS.

Methodology
Gathering and Validating Requirements

The CIPS PTS project team worked collaboratively with key project stakeholders to elicit, analyze, document, and validate the system requirements. The project team leveraged several sources of information and information-gathering techniques, including: Analysis Documentation The team used the as-is business processes analysis, to-be business processes analysis, and system use case models to help ensure that each process step and use case is clearly addressed in the requirements. Facilitated Sessions The team conducted facilitated sessions with subject-matter experts to elicit requirements. Artifact Analysis By using direct observation techniques to document the as-is business processes, the team captured samples of inputs and outputs (e.g., data objects) for each process step. The team refined the list of inputs and outputs envisioned for CIPS PTS during the analysis of the to-be business processes. The team reviewed each of these artifacts and documented the requirements they suggest. 1.3.2 Organizing and Documenting Requirements

The CIPS PTS project team captured and organized functional requirements by use case. The team documented the initial set of use cases in the CIPS PTS system use case model and refined the use cases during the requirements gathering phase. The CIPS PTS use cases contained in this functional requirements document describe the to-be user-to-system and system-to-system interactions. The use cases describe the distinct goals of the to-be system actors and identify the CIPS PTS functional requirements that support the achievement of user goals. Sections 3 through 70 of this functional requirements document contain the use case specifications for CIPS PTS. Each first-level heading (e.g., 3, 4, and 5) represents a single use case. Within each use case specification, section x.4 (e.g., 3.4, 4.4, and 5.4) describes the flow of events and contains the functional requirements for the use case. Note that there may be fourth-level headings that do not contain any functional requirements (e.g., log on, receive notification, and log off). These activities contain generic requirements that are specified in the supplementary requirement document. The CIPS PTS project team used Rational Software Modeler to develop the use case diagrams and activity diagrams that are depicted in this document. The project team used notation and syntax that conforms to Unified Modeling Language (UML)

The CIPS PTS project team uses Rational RequisitePro to capture and manage the system requirements. The CIPS PTS Rational RequisitePro project is based on the Rational RequisitePro use case template. Refer to the CIPS PTS Requirements Management Plan for details about the organization and management of the CIPS PTS RequisitePro project.

Conceptual Overview
Stakeholder Needs

Section 1.2.1 describes key challenges of the as-is system architecture that supports CIPS' personnel security business processes. The objective of the first release of CIPS PTS is to address these business problems by satisfying the following stakeholder needs:     STRQ1 Improve personnel security management STRQ2 Replace poorly integrated systems STRQ3 Improve PII safeguards STRQ4 Improve reporting

The first release of CIPS PTS will include the system features listed below:                  FEAT1 Manage on-boarding requests FEAT2 Track on-boarding tasks FEAT3 Manage investigation and adjudication records FEAT4 Manage issuance of OCC-issued security badges FEAT5 Manage issuance of SmartIDs FEAT6 Manage issuance of OCC credentials FEAT7 Manage issuance of national security clearances FEAT8 Manage employee and contractor personnel security data FEAT9 Manage reinvestigations FEAT10 Manage off-boarding requests FEAT11 Track off-boarding tasks FEAT12 Automate workflow-based notifications and scheduling FEAT13 Generate standard and ad hoc reports FEAT14 Manage system security FEAT15 Provide online help FEAT16 Comply with OCC security and privacy policies FEAT17 Comply with OCC information technology standards

These features will support the to-be personnel security business processes identified in section 1.2.2 and will fulfill the stakeholder needs identified in section 2.1.

The primary goal of the context diagram is to create a notional view of the to-be system context. It is important to note that OCC expects to adapt the to-be system context to accommodate the capabilities and strengths of the solution chosen to meet its needs. The to-be system context diagram is not intended to take the place of a technical architecture. As mentioned above, a system context document defines the applications and interfaces in place to support the business needs. In contrast, a technical architecture defines the technical environment and underlying services that allow the applications to operate. A CIPS PTS technical architecture diagram will be produced in a later project phase.

Term Activity Diagram Actor Alternate Flow Basic Flow Post-condition Pre-condition Primary Actor Secondary Actor Use Case Use Case Description Use Case Diagram Definition An activity diagram represents the business and operational step-by-step workflows of components in a system. An activity diagram shows the overall flow of control. An actor is an external role, human, or device, that interacts with the system. An alternate flow is a system flow associated with potential alternate (error) result for a step of the use case execution. The basic flow is the system flow associated with a successful processing of the use case. The post-condition is the condition of the system when the use case has completed successfully. The pre-condition(s) is the condition(s) that must exist for the use case to begin. The primary actor is the actor that calls on the system to deliver one of its services. The primary actor initiates the interaction. A secondary actor is an external actor that receives or provides a service to the system as a supporting actor. A use case is a description of a system's behavior as it responds to a request that originates from outside of that system. The use case description is a brief statement of the goal of a use case. A use case diagram is a UML diagram that depicts the interaction between actors and the system to perform the function addressed by the use case.

Introduction
Document Purpose and Scope

This document describes the supplementary requirements for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) Critical Infrastructure Protection and Security (CIPS) Personnel Tracking System (PTS). A supplementary requirement is defined as any non-functional requirement that is not readily described by a use case (e.g., technical requirements, performance requirements, security requirements, reporting requirements, and accessibility requirements). Functional requirements, which are described by a use case, are captured in the CIPS PTS functional requirements document. Together, the supplementary requirements and the functional requirements constitute the full set of CIPS PTS requirements.

1.2
1.2.1

CIPS Project Background
Business Need

CIPS plans to implement a new system, known as CIPS PTS, to replace its collection of existing personnel security systems, improve business processes, and enhance data management. Today, CIPS uses a number of disconnected systems-- Microsoft (MS) Excel, MS Access, and Lotus Notes databases--to manage security actions. The ad hoc and disconnected nature of these systems results in a number of problems, including: Weak Safeguards for PII The existing systems provide sufficient, but incomplete, safeguards for personally identifiable information (PII) as described in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-122 Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information. Redundant Data Entry Lack of automated interfaces between the existing systems causes redundant data entry, which results in an inefficient use of staff time and increases the likelihood of data errors. Lack of a Central Data Repository The OCC does not currently have a central system of record for contractor information. The lack of this type of central database means that data routinely becomes out-of-sync between the current systems, which reduces data quality and increases the effort required to use the information. Labor-Intensive Reporting The disconnected nature of the existing systems results in manual data filtering, sorting, and aggregation to create reports. As a result, creating reports represents a significant work effort each month for CIPS staff.
Operations Program Management Office 1 Version 2.0 June 23, 2009

CIPS Personnel Tracking System Supplementary Requirements Document

CIPS

Reduced Focus on Security-Related Work The existing systems require a significant manual effort to complete tasks that are often automated in technologically advanced applications (e.g., data filtering to create meaningful reports). As a result, CIPS personnel are less focused on the core business of security. Inability to Meet Audit Requirements OCC's fiscal year (FY) 2007 independent financial audit resulted in a significant deficiency related to information technology (IT) controls. As part of that finding, auditors cited the need for the OCC to more effectively control the off-boarding process. Throughout FY 2008, OCC has been actively resolving this deficiency. CIPS PTS will contribute to the remediation by providing accountability for the off-boarding process. 1.2.2 System Scope

The scope of the first release of CIPS PTS includes the system features necessary to support the following personnel security business processes. Refer to the to-be business processes analysis for more information about these processes.  Obtain on-boarding information  Process on-boarding request  Determine on-boarding requirements  Finalize on-boarding request  On-board personnel  Establish candidate suitability  Conduct background investigation  Issue OCC credential  Issue national security clearance  Maintain personnel  Conduct reinvestigation  Replace OCC credential  Update personnel information  Generate reports  Grant national security clearance  Renew SmartID  Replace SmartID  Conduct contractor status audit  Conduct contractor off-boarding audit  Off-board personnel  Complete CIPS off-boarding tasks System features to support other CIPS business processes (e.g., physical security and emergency security) are outside the scope of the first release of CIPS PTS.

Methodology
Gathering and Validating Requirements

The CIPS PTS project team leveraged industry best practices and existing requirements literature to gather, analyze, document, and validate the supplementary requirements. Refer to section 1.4 for a listing of reference materials that the team used when gathering and validating requirements. 1.3.2 Managing Requirements

The CIPS PTS project team uses Rational RequisitePro to capture and manage the system requirements. The CIPS PTS Rational RequisitePro project is based on the Rational RequisitePro use case template. Refer to the CIPS PTS Requirements Management Plan for details about the organization and management of the CIPS PTS RequisitePro project.

15 Workflow / Notifications Requirements
15.1 Context
CIPS PTS workflow and notification requirements support system timeliness and completeness in daily user interaction with the system. CIPS PTS will use business rules to schedule reminders and a calendar capability to effectively manage workflow. Workflow and notification requirements will be used to determine, and in some cases eliminate potential problems with, the processing of personnel.

15.2 Requirements
SUPL64 The system shall deliver an integrated, configurable workflow management capability to automate routing of required activities, documents, transactions, forms and reports. SUPL64.1 The system shall provide the capability to customize workflow processes to automate CIPS defined business rules without the need to change the application code. SUPL64.1.1 The system shall provide the ability to export the customized workflow business rules. SUPL64.2 The system shall provide the ability to determine a candidate's processing requirements (e.g., on-boarding requirements), thereby dictating the workflow, by utilizing data in the reference tables. SUPL64.3 The system shall provide the ability to track multiple levels of status for all employees and contractors. This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to assign a status to each employee or contractor and each activity. SUPL64.4 The system shall support workflow that includes but is not limited to the following activities:           On-boarding request (including approvals of requests) On-boarding tasks IT access request Special agreement check (SAC) investigation Background investigation Adjudication processing OCC credential request (including approvals of requests) Police report request National Security Clearance (NSC) issuance Smart ID processing

CIPS

SUPL64.4.1 The system shall provide the capability to enforce defined separation of duties, inherently preventing a user from applying more than one level of approval on the same document as part of the workflow process. For example, a Personnel Security Technician must not be allowed to provide an adjudication decision for an individual to whom he has assigned an adjudication recommendation. SUPL64.5 The system shall employ a workflow calendar function to generate datebased process alerts and notifications. For example, delivering a notification to an employee or contractor when a reinvestigation must be completed in the next 90 days and continuously alerting them every 7 days prior to completing the reinvestigation. The actions that would trigger this type of notification include but are not limited to the following:       Conduct reinvestigation Renew SmartID Complete investigation packet Complete on-boarding request Contractor audits Complete off-boarding request

SUPL64.5.1 The system shall send a quarterly e-mail notification to off-boarding business unit points of contact (POCs) to remind them to follow the OCC's offboarding processes. SUPL64.6 The system shall provide the capability to capture in a workflow log the request and approval actions for each personnel security record. The workflow log should capture the transactions in a sequenced manner, including the time/date and the action type. SUPL64.7 The system shall provide the capability to route action requests and status messages internally to individuals, groups (e.g., business unit POCs), and external parties. SUPL64.8 The system shall provide the capability to generate workflow-based user alerts. For example, when an on-boarding request is approved, the system should

CIPS

notify the affected employee and COTR that an OCC security appointment must be scheduled. SUPL64.9 The system shall deliver the capability to generate event-based user alerts based on agency-defined thresholds (i.e., trigger events). For example, notify a system administrator when available investigation funds reach 50% of the allotment or notify a Personnel Security Officer when an employee or contractor has not completed his reinvestigation within the time frame required by the current business rules. SUPL64.10 The system shall provide the capability to display action requests and status messages to a user via a user-specific workflow dashboard. SUPL64.11 The system shall allow users to schedule, reschedule, cancel, and confirm appointments including, but not limited to, the following:          Personal identity verification appointment Adjudication appointment Badge pick-up appointment SmartID enrollment appointment SmartID activation appointment SmartID renewal appointment SmartID pick-up appointment Reinvestigation appointment Name change verification appointment

SUPL64.12 The system shall provide the ability to send standard notifications to support workflow. Supported communications channels must include OCC e-mail, external e-mail, and internal application messaging (i.e., workflow-based user alerts and event-based user alerts. SUPL64.12.1 The system shall provide the ability to customize standard e-mail notification with user-entered free-form content. SUPL64.12.2 The system shall use the recipient's OCC e-mail address as the primary e-mail address for all e-mail notifications. SUPL64.12.3 The system shall use the recipient's external e-mail address when an OCC e-mail address does not exist for the recipient.

16 Reference Data Requirements
16.1 Context
This section provides requirements related to reference data that will be maintained in CIPS PTS. Reference data refers to all non-transactional information required for the system to function as expected. Reference data includes text box lookup values, business rules, system configuration information (e.g., server IP addresses), and similar information that is not typically updated based on nonadministrative user activities. These requirements describe support for reference data use and management. The requirements reflect the known classes of reference data. A complete set of reference data should be developed before the end of the system design phase.

16.2 Requirements
SUPL65 The system shall provide a GUI to update all reference data tables that are likely to require modifications more than once per year. SUPL65.1 The system shall provide the ability to maintain reference data that identifies which OCC position titles require an OCC credential. SUPL65.2 The system shall provide the ability to maintain reference data that identifies which OCC position titles require a national security clearance. SUPL65.3 The system shall provide the ability to maintain reference data that identifies which OCC employee(s) acts as the OCC credential approver(s) for each OCC organizational unit. SUPL65.4 The system shall provide the ability to maintain reference data that identifies investigation costs by investigation type. SUPL65.5 The system shall provide the ability to maintain reference data that identifies which business unit off-boarding group mail box(es) are used by each OCC organizational unit. SUPL65.6 The system shall provide the ability to maintain the content of all standard e-mail notifications. SUPL65.7 The system shall provide the ability to maintain reference data that identifies business rules for system-generated alerts and notifications (e.g., business rules for reminding an individual to complete the reinvestigation process). The processes that have business rules include but are not limited to the following:

Introduction
Document Purpose and Scope

This document describes the analysis class model for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) Critical Infrastructure Protection and Security (CIPS) personnel security business processes. The analysis class model identifies and describes the relationships among the business-level analysis classes that exist within the personnel security business domain. The scope of the model is limited to the business-level analysis classes and the corresponding attributes. For purposes of this model, "analysis classes" correspond to "entity classes" as defined in the Rational Unified Process (RUP). That is, they represent elements that are central to the personnel security business domain.

1.2
1.2.1

CIPS Project Background
Business Need

CIPS plans to implement a new system, known as the CIPS Personnel Tracking System (PTS), to replace its collection of existing personnel security systems, improve business processes, and enhance data management. Today, CIPS uses a number of disconnected systems--Microsoft (MS) Excel, MS Access, and Lotus Notes-- to manage personnel security actions and information. The ad hoc and disconnected nature of these systems results in a number of problems, including: Weak Safeguards for PII The existing systems provide sufficient, but incomplete, safeguards for personally identifiable information (PII) as described in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-122 Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information. Redundant Data Entry Lack of automated interfaces between the existing systems causes redundant data entry, which results in an inefficient use of staff time and increases the likelihood of data errors. Lack of a Central Data Repository for Contractors The OCC does not currently have a central sys-tem of record for contractor information. The lack of this type of central database means that data routinely becomes out-of-sync between the current systems, which reduces data quality and increases the effort required to use the information. Labor-Intensive Reporting The disconnected nature of the existing systems results in manual data filtering, sorting, and aggregation to create reports. As a result, creating reports represents a significant work effort each month for CIPS staff.

CIPS

Reduced Focus on Security-Related Work The existing systems require a significant manual effort to complete tasks that are often automated in technologically advanced applications (e.g., data filtering to create meaningful reports). As a result, CIPS personnel are less focused on the core business of security. Inability to Meet Audit Requirements OCC's fiscal year (FY) 2007 independent financial audit resulted in a significant deficiency related to information technology (IT) controls. As part of that finding, auditors cited the need for the OCC to more effectively control the off-boarding process. Throughout FY 2008, OCC has been actively resolving this deficiency. CIPS PTS will contribute to the remediation by providing accountability for the off-boarding process. 1.2.2 The Business Domain

The business domain is the specific area of the CIPS business that is being researched and that will benefit from the new CIPS PTS. As described in section 1.1, this analysis class model represents the personnel security business domain, which is comprised of the following processes and subprocesses:  Obtain employee or contractor information  Determine employee on-boarding requirements  Determine contractor on-boarding requirements  Approve on-boarding packet  On-board personnel  Establish candidate suitability  Conduct background investigation  Issue credential  Issue national security clearance  Maintain personnel  Conduct reinvestigation  Replace credential  Update personnel information  Generate reports  Grant national security clearance  Renew SmartID  Replace SmartID  Off-board personnel  Complete CIPS off-boarding tasks Refer to the to-be business processes analysis for more information about these processes.

Methodology

The CIPS PTS project team worked collaboratively with key project stakeholders to identify, describe, and validate the classes and attributes that are part of the analyOperations Program Management Office 2 Version 1.0 May 14, 2009

CIPS Personnel Tracking System Analysis Class Model

CIPS

sis class model. The project team leveraged several sources of information and information-gathering techniques, including: Analysis Documentation The team used the to-be business processes analysis and the functional requirements document to identify the analysis classes. Validation of the to-be business processes and analysis of use case behavior provided the team with a comprehensive set of elements that exist within the personnel security business domain. Artifact Analysis The team reviewed previously captured samples of inputs and outputs (e.g., data objects) for each process step to document and validate the set of attributes that comprises each analysis class. Facilitated Sessions The team conducted facilitated sessions with key stakeholders to validate the classes, attributes, and associations that comprise the analysis class model. The CIPS PTS project team developed the analysis class model and class diagrams using Rational Software Modeler. The team used notation and syntax that conforms to Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.0. The UML standards used for CIPS PTS are described in Appendix B of this document.

The table below provides a list of UML class modeling terms and symbols, with corresponding definitions, used in this document.3 Table B-1 Analysis Class Model Terms, Symbols, and Definitions
Term and Symbol Aggregation relationship Definition An aggregation relationship conveys a whole-part relationship between two classes in which the parts can exist separately. This type of relationship is best thought of as an "owns a" relationship. This line symbol between SampleClass1 and SampleClass2 depicts an aggregation relationship between the two entity classes. In this example SampleClass1 "owns" SampleClass2. An association relationship conveys a naturally occurring link between two classes. This type of relationship is best thought of as a "has a" relationship. This line symbol between SampleClass1 and SampleClass2 depicts an association relationship between the two entity classes. An attribute is a detail of a class. This symbol represents an entity class with defined attributes.

Association relationship

Attribute

Attribute multiplicity

The multiplicity of an attribute specifies how many instances of the attribute's type can be created when the owning class is instantiated.

A black-box view is a depiction of a class from the outside. A black-box class identifies the relationships between the class and the other classes in the model; however, it does not specify anything about the internal organization of the class (e.g., attributes). It is appropriate to represent a black-box view when the attributes of the class are not managed by CIPS PTS and therefore do not need to be known to understand the functionality of the class. This symbol represents a black box-view of an entity class. A class represents a group of things that have common state and behavior. An entity class models one component that exists in the business domain. The name given to an entity class used to represent the type of information that the entity class conveys to the business domain. A composition relationship conveys a containment relationship between two classes in which the contained parts cannot exist separately. This type of relationship is best thought of as an "is part of" relationship. This line symbol between SampleClass1 and SampleClass2 depicts a composition relationship between the two entity classes. In this example SampleClass2 "is part of" SampleClass1. An inheritance relationship conveys that the target of the relationship is a less specific version of the source class. This type of relationship is best thought of as an "is a" relationship. This arrow symbol between SampleClass1 and SampleClass2 depicts an inheritance (generalization) relationship between the two entity classes.

1.0 Introduction
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), "Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors," established the requirement for a mandatory, Government-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government to its employees and contractor employees assigned to Government contracts in order to enhance security, increase Government efficiency, reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy. As a result, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released "Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201: Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors" on February 25, 2005. FIPS establishes the requirements and business processes for the development of PIV contact/contact-less smart cards. The USAccess Program solution, powered by EDS Assured IdentityTM, provides a turnkey service to produce compliant PIV credentials and to maintain associated identity accounts. The GSA HSPD-12 Shared Services Provider II mission is to serve as the executive agent for Government-wide acquisition of information technology to implement HSPD-12. That mission includes the effort to provide Federal agencies with interoperable identity management and credentialing solutions that provide end-to-end services to enroll Applicants, issue credentials, and manage the lifecycle of these credentials.

1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to identify optional methods and interfaces developed within the USAccess system for agencies to create, update, and query sponsorship and adjudication data. This document also identifies Web services developed for agencies to manually input Applicant data, or to import batch data records related to sponsorship or adjudication functions.

1.2 Scope
Web service operations for agencies (AgencyService) have been developed for the USAccess system and are described in detail for the following sponsorship and adjudication functions: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Create a new employee or contractor data record (CreateNewEmployeeContractor) Update an employee or contractor data record (UpdateEmployeeContractor) Query an existing employee or contractor information (QuerySIP) Query for a list of modified Applicants (QueryModifiedList)

The USAccess system also allows agencies to import multiple sponsorship and adjudication records in a single request via the Sponsorship Portal. This functionality, available only to the Security Officer, is described in this document.

Authoritative User Data Interface Design

2.0 System Overview
The USAccess system offers agencies three methods for creating, updating, and querying sponsorship and adjudication data. 1. An agency Sponsor may choose to manually enter the application information via the EDS Assured Identity Sponsorship Web Portal and an Adjudicator may enter the adjudication information via the EDS Assured Identity Adjudication Web Portal. 2. The agency may choose to batch import existing data (create only). 3. The agency may choose to use Web service operations offered by the USAccess system. The USAccess system exposes methods from the AgencyService Web service: 1. CreateNewEmployeeContractor 2. UpdateEmployeeContractor 3. QuerySIP 4. QueryModifiedList These methods may be used by the agency to import single application records into the USAccess identity management system (IDMS). In addition, USAccess permits the agency Security Officer to batch import sponsorship and adjudication records via the EDS Assured Identity Security Web portal.

2.1 Business Rules
2.1.1 Business Rules for Data Validation

Data values provided in a request affect the process state of the Applicant and the following business rules are applied.

2.1.1.1 Applicant Record Uniqueness
The following fields uniquely identify an Applicant record. An attempt to create a sponsorship with the same values indicates a new sponsorship for an existing Applicant. ˇ ˇ ˇ LastName DateOfBirth SSN

2.1.1.2 Minimum Required Data
A minimum set of data is required to create a record in the system, without which the request is rejected. The minimum set of data required to create a record is: ˇ ˇ SponsorOrganizationalIdentifier FirstName

Authoritative User Data Interface Design ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ LastName DateOfBirth SSN CitizenshipCountryCode

2.1.1.3 Data Required for Complete Sponsorship
A complete sponsorship record is required to allow an Applicant to enroll or, if the Applicant is already enrolled, to allow the credential issuance for the sponsorship to proceed. The following set of data is required for a complete sponsorship: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Minimum Required Data fields (above) Address Line 1 Address City Address State (for country's requiring a state code) Address Zip Address Country Code Employment Status PersonOrganizationAssociationCategoryCode SponsorPID DateofSponsorship PIVCardRequiredCode PIVCardType CardShippingAddressCode

2.1.1.4 Data Required for Adjudication
To record the NAC (NCHC/FBI) results or the NACI results, the minimum information required is the AdjudicationValue, AdjudicationEffectiveDate and AdjudicatorPID. For issuance to commence at least an approved NAC value is required. If a NACI value is provided and a NAC value does not exist, the NAC value will be populated using the NACI value. ˇ ˇ ˇ NACAdjudicationValue NACAdjudicationEffectiveDate NACAdjudicatorPID

2.1.1.5 Data Required for Issuance
For the issuance of the applicant's credential to be processed, the following data must be complete: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Data Required for Complete Sponsorship Data Required for Adjudication Applicant must have enrolled PIVCardRequired must be TRUE WorkEmail (or the PIVCertificateSet must be set to 9) UPN

2.1.1.6 Data Required for OPM Submission
For the applicant data to be submitted through the USAccess system to OPM for the background investigation the following data must be complete:

Authoritative User Data Interface Design ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Data Required for Complete Sponsorship Applicant must have enrolled Birth City, Birth State Code (if applicable), Birth Country Code SON, SOI and OPAC codes

2.1.1.7 Specifying Citizenship
The IsUSCitizen flag and the CitizenshipCountryCode are validated together. If the IsUSCitizen is TRUE, the CitizenshipCountryCode must be `US'. If the IsUSCitizen is FALSE the CitizenshipCountryCode must not be `US'. Any non-US CitizenshipCountryCode will result in a BLUE color name bar on the applicant PIV card.

2.1.2

Business Rules for Data Updates

2.1.2.1 Creating a Sponsorship for an Existing Applicant
An applicant record may exist in the system without a Sponsorship in the requesting agency. When this occurs the request will only create a sponsorship (if one does not already exist) and will not modify any applicant data.

2.1.2.2 Updating an Existing Applicant
The UpdateEmployeeContractor service method must be used to update and existing applicant or sponsorship record. If the applicant is in the issuance process for any sponsorship ­ i.e. a credential is being produced ­ the applicant data cannot be modified and the request will be rejected. If the applicant is the issuance process for the sponsorship being updated the request will be rejected.

2.1.2.3 Partial Updates
In an update request not all values need to be provided. If value of the field is left null ­ i.e. no value provided (distinct from the string null and an empty string) ­ the existing value of the corresponding field in the system is left unchanged. If an empty string is passed as input, the existing value is removed (or replaced with any default value as defined).

2.2 Data Types and Formats
The data fields that can be provided are organized into the following categories: ˇ Person Identifier

Authoritative User Data Interface Design ˇ ˇ ˇ Personal Information Sponsorship Information Adjudication Information

2.2.1
String

Input Data Values

Most of the input values to the system are strings. The exceptions are Date values and Boolean values which are special strings. Strings can have the following values: ˇ ˇ ˇ A non-empty string An empty string (indicates that the default, as specified, to be used) No value provided (null: in a create request is treated as an empty string; in an update it indicates that the existing value be left unchanged)

Leading and trailing spaces in string values will be removed. Boolean Boolean values must have one of the following values: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ TRUE FALSE An empty string (indicates that the default as specified to be used) No value provided (null: only in an update indicating that the existing value be left unchanged)

Date All date values must be in the following format in a bulk import file: ˇ YYYY-MM-DD

Date values in the Web Service must be in the DateTime format. A null date is specified by sending a value of 0001-01-01 ­ in a create request this indicates that no value is supplied and in an update that the existing value be left unchanged.

2.2.2

Agency Specific Codes

Some of the data fields require the use of agency specific codes. The list of codes that can be used is available through the Bulk Import Information Report through the USAccess Reports Portal.

3.0 Web Service Operations
The Agency Service is based on the AWG Agency-SIP service specification. Details of the methods exposed are covered in this section.

3.1 Create New Employee or Contractor
The CreateNewEmployeeContractor Web service operation allows agencies to create sponsorship data for a new employee or contractor. See Appendix B - Create New Employee Contractor Input/Output Parameters. At a minimum, the following data elements must be provided for a sponsorship record to be created: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ SponsorOrganizationalIdentifier FirstName LastName DateOfBirth SSN

If other data elements required in the business rules are missing or invalid, default values are used instead, the transaction status is set to `Success ­ Conditional', and details on the invalid or missing elements are returned in the status message. If values for all the fields required for sponsorship have not been provided, the sponsorship record is marked as Incomplete. If sponsorship is complete and the applicant has not already enrolled, the applicant will be notified to proceed to enrollment. If enrollment is complete and all other requirements for credential issuance are met, the production of the card will commence.

3.2 Update Employee Contractor
The UpdateEmployeeContractor Web service operation allows agencies to update existing sponsorship data for an employee or contractor. See Appendix C - Update Employee Contractor Input/Output Parameters. At a minimum, the following data elements must be provided for a sponsorship to be updated: ˇ ˇ SponsorOrganizationalIdentifier PersonID

Values not provided (the XML tag for the element is not in the request) indicate that the existing values on the record are to be left unchanged.

Authoritative User Data Interface Design If other data elements marked as required in the business rules are missing or invalid, default values are used instead, the transaction status is set to `Success ­ Conditional', and details on the invalid or missing elements are passed in the status message. The sponsorship record is marked as Incomplete and requires the Sponsor to use the EDS Assured Identity Sponsorship Portal to complete the sponsorship.

3.3 QuerySIP
The QuerySIP Web service operation allows agencies to query existing employee and contractor information. See Appendix D - QuerySIP Input/Output Parameters.

3.4 QueryModifiedList
The QueryModifiedList Web service operation allows agencies to retrieve a list of any applicants sponsored by that agency and whose data has been modified in the time range specified. See Appendix E - QueryModifiedList Input/Output Parameters.

4.0 Batch Import
The USAccess system allows agencies to import multiple sponsorship and adjudication records in a single request via the EDS Assured Identity Security Portal. This functionality is only available to the Security Officer. There is a report available on the USAccess Report Portal called Bulk Upload Information. This should be referenced by the creator of the file prior to submitting to USAccess for data creation. Various codes used by USAccess and available within the scope of the Security Officer are listed in the Bulk Upload Information report, including the site code (for shipment of the credential), SponsorPID (the sponsor of record for the applicant) and NACAdjudicatorPersonID (the NAC adjudicator of record for the applicant) can be found on this report. This information must be correctly provided or the record could be rejected outright (depending on the issue) or only partially loaded (requiring a Sponsor or Adjudicator to enter the web portal and complete the missing data elements). Upon successful login to the Security Portal, the Security Officer is able to navigate to the Batch Import Applicants screen (see Figure 1: Batch Import Screen). Once the Security Officer has accessed the Batch Import Applicants screen and clicked the Start Import button, the EDS Assured Identity solution asynchronously executes the import and reports the results to the Security Officer via e-mail.

Figure 1: Batch Import Screen The validation used for Batch Import is identical to the Web service operations described in this document. Table 1: Batch Import Page Fields lists the various functions of the batch import process within the batch import Web service. Table 1: Batch Import Page Fields Label Import for Validation Only Load File Control Check Box Text Box (with browse button) Button Purpose To check a batch file for format errors prior to importing it to the USAccess system.

4.1 Batch Import Confirmation
Batch Import is an asynchronous process. Therefore, USAccess e-mails the Security Officer who performed the bulk import when the process has completed. This e-mail contains three attachments: (1) records successfully added to the IDMS, (2) records that failed to be added to the IDMS due to validation errors, and (3) records that were unreadable due to parsing errors. The Batch Import Success attachment contains tab-delimited values: row ID, last name, first name, Person ID, Person Global User Identifier (GUID), success or warning, and message. The Batch Import Failure attachment contains tab-delimited values: row ID, last name, first name, Person GUID, and failure reason. The Batch Import Parsing Failure attachment contains tab-delimited values: row ID and parser error message.

4.2 Batch Import File Format
Batch Import supports both comma-delimited and tab-delimited files. If the file extension is .txt, the file must be tab-delimited. If the file extension is .csv, the file must be commadelimited. If the file extension is .xml, the file must be an XML file and conform to the Batch Import schema defined in Appendix G. The maximum number of records accepted per upload file is 5,000. If more records per file are required, the agency must indicate this prior to implementation. At a minimum, the following data elements must be provided for a sponsorship record to be created: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ SponsorOrganizationalIdentifier FirstName LastName DateOfBirth SSN

If other data elements marked as required are missing or invalid, default values are used instead, a sponsorship record is created, and details on the invalid or missing elements are passed in the status message. The sponsorship record is marked as Incomplete and requires the Sponsor to use the portal to complete the sponsorship. Data updates cannot be executed through the Bulk Import process. Any changes to data that has already been imported must be modified manually through the portal or using the System Infrastructure Provider (SIP) Web Service. The batch file format is described in Table 2: Batch Import File Format.

Executive Summary
With the increased demand for faster, more efficient and reliant processing of  investigative records in support of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),  Federal Investigative Services Division (FISD) mission, and to satisfy various  Federal mandates (eGov, ClingerCohen Act, et al), the Applications Support  Group (ASG) of the Center for Information Services (CIS), OPM, in cooperation  with FISD and Federal Investigation Processing Center (FIPC), are implementing  an Information Technology (IT) system, the OPM Personnel Investigations  Processing System (PIPS) Imaging System (OPIS). OPIS will allow FISD/FIPC to  evolve from a paper restrictive, to a near paperless work environment for the  management and processing of investigative records. This system is intended to  allow the management and storage of previously closed investigative files;  enhance investigations processing through the use of imaging; and provide  automation of key processes using a Business Process Management (BPM)  software tool.   The implementation of the project is segmented into seven distinct business  functions that will allow the development of key system components and system  infrastructure to meet the core business needs.   The OPIS Investigative Report Management Functionality (IRMF) is the key  system functionality that directly impacts the customers of FISD/FIPC.  Eventually all security products produced by FISD/FIPC in response to  investigative inquiries will process through OPIS IRMF. It is the intent of  FISD/FIPC to provide electronic products to all its customers using an electronic  delivery mechanism to increase the timeliness, efficiency and accuracy of the  products produced and delivered.  FISD/FIPC still will provide nonelectronic  products delivered through conventional means.   OPIS IRMF Agency Delivery (IRMFAD) is the subcomponent of IRMF that  provides investigative results (reports) for a requested Personnel Security  Investigation (PSI) to their identified adjudication facility. These results can be  distributed through a variety of methods and in a variety of formats meeting the  needs of the customer.      This document gives a brief explanation of the OPIS IRMFAD functionality.

Introduction
Scope 
This technical paper is designed to provide FISD/FIPC customers with technical  insight as to the electronic processing of security products (Investigative Case  Files). This technical paper is a representation of information collected from  various resources and is a consolidated representation of the current and  proposed hardware and software solutions for OPIS IRMFAD. This technical  paper is not to be used as a basis of an agreement of services or implied policy or  procedures and may be subject to change.  

Imaging @ OPM 
In response to the OPM Imaging Integration Project, OPM has developed OPIS to  meet the mandates of the eClearance Imaging and PIPS Imaging  Implementation by allowing the conversion of OPM conducted investigations  into electronic files and provide a method for FISD/FIPC to process ongoing  security investigations using an electronic file folder instead of the a paper file  folder. The hardware and software design of OPIS provides the basis of the  information storage and archive for electronic images in support of FISD/FIPC  electronic case processing and eClearance imaging. This imaging activity is the  basis of an all electronic processing of investigative cases through FISD/FIPC and  the basis of the electronic distribution of security products to its customers. 

Investigative Application Suite (IAS) 
OPIS is not a separate system and as its name implies it is a subsystem of the  PIPS and an application that is part of the Investigative Application Suite (IAS).  IAS is a term used to define all the component systems that comprise the  subsystems used by Investigative Services. These systems include;  · · · · · · · · · Clearance Verification System (CVS)   Dashboard  Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (eQIP)  Fingerprint Transaction System (FTS)  Personnel Investigations Processing System (PIPS)  PIPS Financial Interface System (PFIS)  PIPS Reporting (PIPSR)  OPM PIPS Imaging System (OPIS)  Secure Portal

OPIS System Design Model 
The OPIS System Design Model is based on core system functionality provided  to users of the system in seven (7) functional areas. This distinct system  functionality allows system users to perform various work tasks within the  system, which include;  · Document Scanning and Retrieval Functionality (DSRF)  OPIS DSRF  provides the core functionality that will allow FISD/FIPC to convert non electronic artifacts to an electronic form. Most of this conversion is the  transfer of paper artifacts into images.  Freedom of Information/Privacy Act Document Processing  Functionality (FDRF)  OPIS FDPF provides the core functionality that  allows FISD/FIPC to process FOIA and PA request within an electronic  environment  Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (eQIP)  Document Review Function (EDRF)  OPIS EDRF provides the core  functionality that allows FISD/FIPC to review and process electronic and  nonelectronic artifacts that are part of an eQIP submission.  Investigative Report Management Functionality (IRMF)  OPIS IRMF  provides the core functionality that allows FISD/FIPC to produce various  security products related to investigations for customers. These products  include both electronic and nonelectronic products.  Business Process Management Functionality (BPMF) ­ OPIS BPMF  provides the core functionality that allows FISD/FIPC to process all work  tasks in an electronic environment. This workflow provides managers  with a realtime look at the current workload and the ability to manage it  electronically.  Verification, Validation and Testing Functionality (V2TF) ­ OPIS V2TF  provides a complete test environment for the assessment of software  products before they are introduced into the system.  OPIS System Support Functionality (OSSF) ­ OPIS OSSF provides the  core functionality that allows FISD/FIPC to administrate, manage and  monitor the system and provide statistical information as needed.

Section 3
 

Investigative Report Management Functionality (IRMF)
OPIS IRMF, as explained previously, provides the core functionality that will  allow FISD/FIPC to produce various security products related to investigations  for customers. IRMF system components include functionality that allows users  to generate, produce, release, distribute, and manage security products. These  same features are used in IRMFAD 

IRMFAD Components  Generate 
The IRMFAD Generate function allows OPIS to provide a group of default items  (documents) from a variety of sources to be included in the report. These default  items are based on business rules and information provided from PIPS and is  generated in an Automated Mode. IRMFAD Generate also provides OPIS Users  with the ability to add or remove items to be included in the report using its  Manual Mode.  

Produce 
The IRMFAD Produce function takes the individual items selected  automatically or by the user in the IRMFAD Generate function and produces a  Distributed Investigative File (DIF), a combination of image, data elements and  textual information. 

Review and Release 
In Manual Mode, the IRMFAD Review and Release function takes the graphic  report and allows the OPIS users to conduct a final review before the DIF is  released to the recipient (agency). 

Distribute 
The IRMFAD Distribute function allows the OPIS user to select the method in  which the report will be delivered. The system will default the distribution based  on business rules and requested distribution method; however, the user has the  ability to redirect the DIF and/or alter the media (output format).  

Manage 
The IRMFAD Manage function allows the OPIS user to manage all reports  previously processed including deletion and redistribution of previously  generated report based on retention.

IRMFAD Process Flow  
The processing of data through IRMFAD includes the following steps:  1. Initiation of a report request from PIPS (closing action), in which PIPS Core  electronic data and documents are sent to OPIS in the form of an eXtensible  Markup Language (XML) document.   2. Documents that are in a nonelectronic format (microfilm/paper) are converted  and stored in the Image Repository.  3. PIPS Data (XML) is translated and appropriate documents are stored in the  Image Repository and a PIPS generated Agency XML..  4. OPIS Consolidates all releasable case related images into indexed Portable  Document Format (PDF) files.  5. OPIS retrieved the original eQIP XML from archive, if applicable.  6. OPIS encapsulated the PDF and XML files into an encrypted ZIP file.  7. OPIS Generates the DIF Index file, if necessary (see DIF Index File).  8. OPIS sends the ZIP file to PIPS Distribution Repository for distribution.  9. PIPS distributes the DIF to the appropriate agency via an approved secure  connection. 

Distributed Investigative File (DIF) 
A Distributed Investigative File (DIF) is a term used to describe an electronic  representation of a security product (PSI Report) that would normally be  produced in paper. The DIF is a compilation of various electronic documents  stored as data and imaged documents, merged into an image representation  (PDF) and a corresponding data (XML) files encapsulated into an encrypted ZIP  file. Appendix A, provides a table defining which items are provide in each of  the DIF Components.  

DIF Portable Document File (PDF) Format 
The imaged document portion of the DIF is stored and distributed in the Portable  Document File (PDF) Format. PDF is a file format developed by Adobe Systems®  for representing documents in a manner that is independent of the original  application software, hardware and operating system used to create those  documents. A PDF can describe documents containing any combination of text,  graphics and images in a device independent and resolution independent  format. These documents can be one page or thousands of pages, very simple or  extremely complex with a rich use of fonts, graphics, color and images. PDF is an  open standard, and anyone may write applications that can read or write PDF's  royaltyfree. Since PDF is a common standard OPM/FISD does not purport the  use of any single PDF viewer. Any PDF viewer supporting bookmarks and  embedded text should suffice. All case documents are presented in the DIF PDF  to include those presented in the XML Files.

Figure 1: Distributed Investigative File (DIF) 
 

DIF PDF Bookmarks 
All document pages in the PDF are sequential (in Figure 1 pages 1 to 66). The DIF  PDF Bookmarks provide a listing of all documents that are included in the DIF  and an easy method (embedded link) to a specific document in the DIF. The left  panel of Figure 1, displays an example of the DIF Bookmarks. This feature may  not be available in some PDF viewers. 

DIF PDF Special Section 
The DIF PDF Special Section is the set of documents that are separated from the  DIF PDF due to the sensitive nature of the information being presented. These  documents usually require special handling and/or limited access. Not all DIFs  would necessarily require a special section. Some samples of DIF PDF Special  Section documents may be Protected Source and Medical/Psyche Report  documents. The format of the DIF PDF Special Section is the same as the DIF  PDF. These documents would not appear in the Investigation XML File.

DIF Investigation XML File 
The investigations data portion of the DIF is stored as an eXtensible Markup  Language (XML) File, which includes all relevant PIPS Data in XML Data  Element Tags or an ASCII text representation wrapped in an XML Tag. The OPIS  DIF XML Schema and a sample XML file can be found in Appendix B of this  document. The XML File does not include specific element tags for ever data  element in PIPS with the exception of data presented in the Case Closing  Transmittal (CCT) document. 

DIF eQIP Request XML File 
If applicable, the eQIP Request XML File will be provided in the DIF. This XML  file includes all the original information that was passed to OPM for the  processing of the investigation. Information on the eQIP XML Schema can be  provided on request. 

DIF ZIP File 
The DIF ZIP File is the DIF PDF, DIF PDF Special Section, DIF eQIP XML and  DIF Investigation XML wrapped in a WINZIP 9.0 file. This file provides a  method to encapsulate the files into a single file and allows further compression  and encryption. The DIF ZIP File is encrypted using 128 bit AES encryption and  password protected. Passwords for each file will be given in the DIF Index File  and is unique to each file. File Example:  Creation Date: 20060727 (YYYYMMDD) Name: Bugs Bunny Case Number: 06J11111 FileName: 20060727_06J11111_BUNNY.ZIP

Password: **********

DIF Index File (Crosswalk) 
The DIF Index File (Crosswalk) is a XML listing of all DIF ZIP files provided to  an agency for a particular day. The purpose of the DIF Index file is twofold. First,  to provide the receiving agency with a manifest of files sent. Second is to provide  agencies with a method to associate the provided files with the data in their  systems. The DIF Index File is also placed into an encrypted ZIP file that has a  predefined password. The DIF Index File will be named as follows:  CROSSWALK_DateTimeStamp.xml CROSSWALK_DateTimeStamp.zip SAMPLE: CROSSWALK_20070727.XML SAMPLE: CROSSWALK_20070727.ZIP DateTimeStamp ­ Date the file was generated (YYYYMMDD). The DIF Index XML Schema and a sample XML file can be found in Appendix C  of this document.

DIF Naming Convention 
The DIF Naming Convention is based on the investigation key identifiers; Date TimeStamp, Case Information and Subject Information. The DIF Naming  Convention is as follows:  DateTimeStamp_CaseNumber_LastName.pdf DateTimeStamp_CaseNumber_LastName_SS.pdf (Special Section) DateTimeStamp_CaseNumber_LastName.xml DateTimeStamp_CaseNumber_LastName_EQIP.xml DateTimeStamp_CaseNumber_LastName.ZIP 20060727_06J11111_BUNNY.PDF 20060727_06J11111_BUNNY_SS.PDF 20060727_06J11111_BUNNY.XML 20060727_06J11111_BUNNY_EQIP.XML 20060727_06J11111_BUNNY.ZIP DateTimeStamp ­ Date the report was generated (YYYYMMDD). CaseNumber ­ Investigative Case Number assigned by PIPS. LastName ­ Subject's Last Name

DIF Sizing 
The size of the DIF is based solely on the size of the number of pages in the  investigative file. Variances in the size of an investigative file can be influenced  by a variety of factors to include the type of investigation requested, indication of  issues within the case, agency specific information and the inclusion of artifacts  to support the investigation (affidavits, court records, bankruptcy, etc.).  After conducting an analysis of a variety of investigation types and results we  have concluded that a majority of case files (eighty percent, 80%) contain no  more that fortytwo (42) pages of information (including the PIPS Data). Further  analysis showed that using basic PDF compression (Unisys Lempel Ziv Welch  (LZW) for textual data and Consultative Committee on International Telegraphy  and Telephony (CITT) Group 4 for images) we can estimate that a single DIF  page is approximately thirtyseven kilobytes (37kb) in size. With this information  we can estimate that the approximate size of a DIF is onethousandfive hundredfiftyfour kilobytes 1,554kb (onepointfiveone megabytes, 1.5mb).  Also noted in our analysis was the minimum investigative file size of five (5)  pages and maximum investigative file size of two hundred (200) pages. File sizes  for these DIFs would be onehundredeightyfive kilobytes (185kb) and seven thousandfourhundred kilobytes (7,400kb) (sevenpointtwotwo megabytes,  7.22mb).

Distribution Methods 
There are two basic distribution methods: electronic and paper delivery. The  paper method includes the delivery mechanism of Conventional Mail. The  electronic method includes two (2) delivery mechanisms which include PIPS  Electronic Delivery (PED) and Electronic System to System Transfer (ESST). PED  and S2ST are currently available to agencies. As we continue to develop the  process other delivery mechanisms and methods may become available such as  secure email, portal subscription and other delivery mechanisms.  

Conventional Mail 
The conventional mail delivery mechanism includes many mail delivery options  such as United States Postal Service, United Parcel Service® and Federal  Express®. Another conventional mail delivery mechanism is direct courier.  Although paper is the preferred medium for this delivery mechanism, reports  can also be provided in an electronic medium such as Compact Disk Read Only  Memory (CDROM).   

PIPS Electronic Delivery (PED) 
PIPS Electronic Delivery (PED) is currently available to certain agencies through  the PIPS Agency Menu and is provided for a limited set of cases files that meet  certain criteria. Reports being sent via this method are not processed in OPIS. 

Electronic SystemtoSystem Transfer (ESST) 
The electronic delivery mechanism, SystemtoSystem Transfer is a direct  electronic delivery of security products from OPM/FISD to the customer's  supported system. All connections will be established using the OPM standard,  "CONNECT:Direct Secure+" software and only be in one direction: from OPM to  the supported agency. Information on this software package and pricing can be  found at the following URL:  http://www.sterlingcommerce.com/Products/AllProducts/Connect/direct.htm 

Frequency of Delivery 
The frequency of delivery is based on a scheduled time delivery. Future options  that may be developed include size, time and size and delivery on demand. The  following describes those options. Delivery options for CD/DVD Media will be  done only on a casebycase basis. 

Time Based Delivery 
The time based delivery, currently the only option available, is a batch delivery  of all items on a set time. This set time is based on a specified time when the  agency expects the delivery to occur. Important technical factors to consider are;  the size of the information (file) being send and the other operations that may be  using that communications line during the day.   

OPM Agency Delivery Technical Paper

Size Based Delivery 
The size based delivery would be a batch delivery of all items when a certain size  limitation or item count is reached. Important factors to consider is that if the size  limit or item count is not met the files awaiting delivery may not be sent the  same day they were processed. 

Time and Size Based Delivery 
The time and size based delivery would be a batch delivery of all items when a  certain size limitation is reached, item count or time is reached. This gives the  best of both worlds in that all files created that day would be delivered in no less  than a twentyfour hour period. 

Delivery on Demand 
The Delivery on Demand based delivery would send each item as it is available.  In this method the customer benefits by receiving the item quickly.

Section 4
 

IRMF-Agency Delivery Distribution Pilot
The IRMFAD Distribution Pilot is an implementation of the ESST delivery  mechanism to a select group of customers and a limited number of files. The  pilot will display the system ability to generate, produce and deliver security  products in an efficient and timely manner. Upon completion of the pilot other  agencies and items will be transitioned to this method.  

Pilot Agencies  
It has been determined that since there is a diversity in the customer based that a  limited pilot with a few agencies would be necessary to successfully prove that  Agency Delivery is a viable option for all FISD customers. FISD has solicited a  number of agencies to participate in this pilot and is currently working with  those agencies to establish a common understanding of the technical and policy  agreements needed to establish connections and provide case information  electronically. To participate in the pilot please contact the Functional Contact in  Section 7 of this document.  

Data Transfer 
Data Transfer between OPM and agencies will be made using an established  link. The data from OPIS will be transferred to the PIPS File Server using a  CONNECT:Direct link in which it will store files until distributed to the agency.  OPM will use a CONNECT:Direct Secure Plus link to distribute the files to the  agency. 

DIF Case Load 
Because of limitations of the pilot, agencies need to be aware of the amount of  cases being transferred via this method and the amount of electronic storage  necessary to hold this information. Agencies should contact FISD to determine  the how much data they can expect based on current and projected case loads.

Section 5
 

Security Requirements
In order for OPM systems to connect and exchange data there are a number of  security requirements that must be in place before the actual connection and  exchange of information can be arranged. The primary documentation needed to  accomplish this is through a Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement and a  System Interconnection Agreement.  

Memorandum of Understanding/Agreements (MOU/A) 
The Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement (MOU/MOA) spells out the  agreement on the exchange of information between two agencies. The MOU/A  details the "who, what and when" of the information exchange. Examples of  MOU/MOAs can be provided as necessary from FISD.  

System Interconnection Agreement (SIA) 
The System Interconnection Agreement (SIA) spells out the details of how  agency systems connect to each other to exchange information. The SIA details  the hardware, software and configuration necessary to connect the two systems  as well as the "rules of behavior" for persons using and accessing systems. The  SIA also details the communications path and details of information security.

Summary
With the implementation of OPIS IRMFAD we will provide customers with a  variety of electronic delivery options that will provide a robust and timely  product. Although this pilot is specifically with a small group of agencies, FISD  hopes to eventually move its entire customer base to an electronic distribution  process.

Data Exchange Partner Responsibilities

As a business partner of the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM), you are expected to understand and comply with the responsibilities outlined below. These responsibilities are security controls set up to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of OPM's stored data and information systems. Service Restoration and Disaster Recovery Details: OPM maintains a Disaster
Recovery Plan for restoration of service. The design of the process to exchange data has been engineered according to the details of the plan. If the plan is executed, you will be contacted with instructions how to alter the exchanges.

Problem Reporting: When problems occur, your organization is expected to report the
incident to the OPM Data Center Group (DCG) promptly for resolution. The numbers available for contact are the OPM HELP Desk at 202-606-4927 or the DCG Data Exchange Coordinator at 202-606-1436.

Problem Resolutions: The availability of the computer systems is a matter of importance
both to your organization and OPM. You are responsible for assisting OPM solving problems in the event the transfer process/connection becomes non-operational.

Protection of Data: You are not allowed to introduce any unauthorized data (including data
protected by copyright, trademark, other proprietary data or material with other intellectual property rights) onto OPM's system. In addition, you will protect all sensitive information received from OPM. This includes records about individuals requiring protection under the Privacy Act, sensitive financial information, and information that cannot be released under the Freedom of Information Act. To be in compliance with the OMB memorandum M-06-16, you are required to delete sensitive data received from OPM within 90 days unless its use is still required as documented in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with OPM.

Use of Secure Point-of-Entry (SPOE): You will not be issued an OPM Userid and
password. You will be using the Connect:Direct SPOE to exchange data with OPM's system. SPOE eliminates the need for data partners to exchange Userid and password information, by matching the incoming userid, IP address and Connect:Direct node name to an entry on the product's authentication table. However, you must protect your password from disclosure by all reasonable means, and not willingly divulge it or allow its use by any other person(s).

Questionnaire Updates: You agree to complete the questionnaire provided and to notify
OPM promptly of changes in its information.

Scope of Document This document is the QAP for OPMO. All OPMO-managed projects are subject to the process detailed in this guide. It applies to all the deliverables, work products, and artifacts associated with those projects, throughout the project life cycle. Please note that although some portions of the document pertain only to software development and implementation projects, such as testing quality assurance, most processes and standards described here can and will be applied to all OPMO projects. This includes major internal initiatives as well as work performed for OCC customers. According to the OCC Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) v3.1, QAPs are required for all projects. The SDLC provides a template for these required QAPs. This QAP is based on that template. For smaller and less complex projects, this QAP may serve as the QAP, as long as all quality events are scheduled and included in the project's Integrated Master Schedule (IMS). For larger and more complex projects, this document, with a brief project-specific addendum, satisfies the requirement for a QAP. The Senior Program Manager and Program Manager, in consultation with the Quality Manager, will determine whether this QAP will suffice, or whether a projectspecific addendum is to be prepared. For more information about how to develop the project-specific addendum, please see the guidance in Appendix I.

Document References OPMO used several overarching sources to develop this document, including the OCC SDLC v3.1 framework and the Project Management Institute's Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK). In addition, OPMO used the OCC Comptroller's Memorandum regarding management of information technology systems development projects, dated July 2007. This memorandum provides specific guidance on how quality management responsibilities will be divided between Information Technology Services (ITS) and the OCC PMOs. Table 3 provides specific document references for these sources. Table 3: Document References

Project Quality Management
Overview of Quality Management Program The OPMO Quality Assurance Program is comprehensive and includes all critical QA activities, including the following: ­ Document reviews ­ Peer review ­ Code reviews ­ Testing quality assurance ­ Technical audits ­ End-of-Phase audits ­ Process reviews OPMO supports these direct QA activities with a number of QA infrastructure activities designed to ensure the smooth operation of the quality program. These include the following: ­ A quality planning requirement that ensures quality activities are included in the project schedule and appropriate resources are provided for these activities ­ A process for reporting, tracking, and closing quality findings ­ A quality measurement program ­ Quality training for OPMO staff 2.2 Role of Quality Assurance in OPMO This plan assumes the existence of a dedicated `Quality Manager' within OPMO. However, OPMO does not intend to create a large QA infrastructure outside the project teams. The primary activities of the Quality Manager will be to oversee QA activities, support the quality infrastructure activities listed above, and direct the development and continuous improvement of the OPMO QA program. More specifically, the Quality Manager will perform the follow activities: ­ ­ Participate in quality planning at the project level Monitor project activities to make sure that planned Quality Assurance (QA) activities are taking place and are executed properly ­ Monitor the findings associated with quality reviews and audits to identify any emerging quality issues ­ Track all quality findings to closure ­ Compute and report quality measures ­ Provide basic quality training to members of the OPMO staff and OPMO contractors

It is important to note that although the Quality Manager is responsible for overseeing and developing the quality program, quality assurance is a shared activity among all OPMO staff and support contractors. All project team members are required to participate in and support quality activities by reviewing and scoring documents, attending review sessions, reporting quality findings, and other activities. For more information, see Section 2.4 below. 2.3 Quality Organization The figure below depicts the OPMO organization with the organizational placement of the Quality Manager highlighted. The Quality Manager will report directly to the OPMO Director, but will interact daily with the delivery and operations teams as a provider of QA services.

Quality Activities
Introduction This section describes the major QA activities OPMO performs. It addresses in detail each of the techniques described in Section 3.1, placing them in context and providing additional detail. This discussion focuses in greatest detail on activities that are 1) specific to QA, and 2) not covered in detail in other planning documents. For example, Section 4.2, Document Inspection discusses the document inspection activities in detail but does not cover document preparation activities like outline preparation. Similarly, Section 4.5, Testing Quality Assurance, focuses more on the role of the Quality Manager in monitoring testing activity, while focusing less on testing itself. Testing is a QA activity, but it is covered in detail in required SDLC test planning documents. Because it is difficult to understand a given QA activity unless it is placed in context, this plan presents some detail about the higher-level processes in which the QA activities are embedded, referred to as "core processes", in order to provide that context. In the process flow diagrams, core process steps are presented in white, while QA process steps are presented in gray. Please note that in some cases, detailed "drill downs" of QA processes are provided in addition to the core flow. When this occurs, a representation of the core process appears in the top left of the diagram, with the "drill down" process step highlighted in grey.

4.2

Document Inspection 4.2.1 Introduction - The Document Inspection Process in Context OPMO project teams execute a rigorous document inspection process for all written deliverables and major written work products and artifacts. This process includes supervisory review by both the Senior PM, the PM, and independent QA reviewers. The document inspection process is part of the larger document preparation process. Figure 2 depicts the document preparation process and shows the placement of the document inspection process within it.

Comptroller of the Currency

10

Operations Program Management Office

Quality Assurance Plan Version: 4.0 Operations Program Management Office

Figure 2: Document Preparation Process, Document Inspection Highlighted

As shown in the figure, the document inspection process is performed after the annotated outline and the draft document have been prepared but before any customer (business unit) review. Please note that although the preparation of the annotated outline is not part of the QA process itself, it is a required part of the document preparation process. It improves the efficiency of the QA process by allowing reviewers to weigh in on scope and structure before drafting begins. As a result, reviewers can concentrate on reviewing the content of the document rather than scope and structure, reducing re-work. Some documents will also be subject to a collaborative peer review. In these cases, the peer review process is performed before any formal document inspection process. Please note that although Figure 2 shows three possible times at which a peer review may be conducted, three peer reviews are not required. The three alternatives are presented to show that the timing of the peer review is flexible and depends on the particulars of the project and item being reviewed. For more information about peer review, see Section 4.3. It is also important to note that several steps in this process, including the peer reviews, are collaborative. These are marked as "T Collaborative" in Figure 2.

Comptroller of the Currency

Operations Program Management Office

Quality Assurance Plan Version: 4.0 Operations Program Management Office

These steps are generally performed iteratively, with frequent and open communication among participants. Representatives of customer organizations (business units) may be included in any of the collaborative processes identified above, at the discretion of the Senior Program Manager and Program Manager. It is important to refrain from making judgments about initial quality during these processes to allow collaboration to occur. The table below provides basic information about the document inspection process. Table 7: Document Inspection Information

Peer Review 4.3.1 Introduction Peer review is a structured process that allows for examination and criticism of a team's ideas, approaches, analyses, designs, methods, techniques, and artifacts; always includes individuals with specialized knowledge about the subject matter being reviewed. Peer reviews are conceptual reviews conducted to define the purpose of a document or artifact, determine the content and organization of a document, discuss the approach, and/or set expectations. They are generally conducted as a facilitated meeting. When the item under review is a document or artifact, the peer review should be conducted early in the process of developing the artifact, before any other formal evaluation activities are conducted. It may be held before an outline or draft has been prepared. Alternatively, it may be held to develop an outline or to review a preliminary or "rough draft" of an outline or document. For system implementation projects, a peer review should be conducted for at least the following written documents: ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ ­ System Concept of Operations (ConOps) System Development Plan (SDP) Security Plan Functional Requirements Document (FRD) Test Plan System Design Document (SDD) or Design Description Document (DDD)

In addition, the PM, in conjunction with the relevant Senior Program Manager, may decide to conduct a peer review for any artifact that meets one or more of the following characteristics: ­ Major documents, analyses, concepts, methods, or approaches

Code Review 4.4.1 Introduction Code review is a technical review that focuses on a system's source code. Teams conduct code reviews to find coding errors and other quality issues overlooked in code development. The code review process is part of the larger code development process. Figure 5 depicts the code development process and shows the placement of the code review process within it.

Comptroller of the Currency

Operations Program Management Office

Quality Assurance Plan Version: 4.0 Operations Program Management Office

Figure 5: Code Development Process

As shown in the figure, Code Review is conducted concurrently with code development. It can occur one time or multiple times during development, depending on the complexity of the code, the experience level of the developers, or the extent of findings from previous reviews. OPMO will conduct code reviews for all projects. Code review sessions are facilitated meetings in which members of the project team review code line-byline. Sometimes participants review all code. However, good results are often achieved by reviewing as little as twenty-five percent of the code. Any code that is not subject to a formal code review is to be subject to peer code review. Peer code review is less formal and occurs when members of the development team review each other's code on an ongoing basis during the development process. Table 11 provides basic information about formal code review sessions. Table 11: Code Review Information

Testing Quality Assurance For software implementation projects, the Quality Manager will be actively involved in the testing process. Below, testing quality assurance activities are discussed for each major testing phase. 4.5.1 Unit Testing During unit testing, the developers on the project team verify that each individual component (created or purchased) performs as specified in the design documents. Throughout the development and testing phases, developers will conduct unit tests. Each developer is responsible for identifying the test data that will be used to execute and confirm the results of the unit tests. Prior to the migration of the product from the development environment, the developer will be required to validate that the unit tests were successfully conducted and the proper results were achieved.

System Testing System testing ensures that system components, including application software, data conversion software, job schedules, system modifications and operations procedures, are technically compatible. System testing validates data flows from point to point and ensures that the components of the application operate together as a whole. It also validates that before the application effectively integrates with other existing or new applications. A typical check would be that record or transaction counts from a sending system are the same as those in the receiving system or that a user can perform the steps required to navigate through the application.

4.5.5 User Acceptance Testing The focus of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is the final verification of required system flow and business functions. UAT provides validation of the end users' workflow, using the system just as they would in production. It also allows users to provide feedback on system functionality, workflow and performance. UAT testing not only allows for a final verification of the system's conformance to requirements and design, but also promotes end-user support and buy-in for the new system by soliciting user input prior to deployment. Table 21 provides basic information about the UAT process. Table 21: UAT QA Information

Audits 4.6.1 Technical Audits OPMO will conduct a series of technical audits for each systems implementation project. These audits will be conducted to verify that major system deliverables or artifacts meet or exceed requirements. Below, summary information about each technical audit is presented. For each audit, the role of the Quality Manager is to make sure that the audits are conducted and are properly documented. Teams generally conduct these audits as a facilitated session. Also, these audits generally focus on a checklist that key stakeholders subsequently sign to signify concurrence with audit results. For each required technical audit, OCC's SDLC provides a checklist that OPMO may use. The PM is to determine who will conduct or facilitate each audit session. The PM may choose to facilitate the meeting personally, or may select someone else from project leadership. The PM may select an independent technical expert to facilitate a review. The following tables provide information on how to conduct and document these audits.

4.6.2 End-of-Phase Audits End-of-phase audits are conducted at the conclusion of each SDLC phase to confirm that the project is ready to proceed to the next phase. The audit will generally be performed through a facilitated meeting in which project management, the Quality Manager, and technical experts review project documentation to validate that phase exit criteria are met. Also, these audits generally focus on a checklist that key stakeholders subsequently sign to signify concurrence with audit results. For each required technical audit, OCC's SDLC provides a checklist that OPMO may use. The PM is to determine who will conduct or facilitate each audit session. The PM may choose to facilitate the meeting personally, or may select someone else from project leadership. The PM may select an independent technical expert to facilitate a review.

Quality Planning and Scheduling of QA Activities
In order for QA activities to be successful, QA activities must be adequately planned and resources secured. Specifically, OPMO personnel are to do the following: ­ ­ Include quality planning in overall project planning activities Build QA activities into the project schedule, including adequate time for document inspection, peer review, code review, testing quality assurance, technical audits, endof-phase audits, and process reviews Allocate adequate resources to QA activities when estimating resource needs or levelof-effort

­

The Quality Manager will maintain a master schedule for the OPMO of all quality activities for all projects managed by the OPMO.

Problem Reporting and Corrective Actions
All quality activities can result in findings. It is critical to track these findings until they are resolved. OPMO will use a quality action log to facilitate this tracking. The Quality Manager will maintain the quality action log. The log serves the following two important functions: ­ ­ Tracks outstanding QA issues to ensure they are resolved Provides a record of all quality findings and their resolution; this allows OPMO management to spot, analyze, and address emerging quality trends

All findings associated with quality reviews and audits will be tracked in the quality action log, with the following exceptions: ­ ­ Findings associated with the document review process are tracked here only if they cannot be resolved as part of that process Software defects found in testing are tracked here only if they cannot be resolved as part of the testing process

Appendix II ­ Document Scoring Guidelines
These guidelines should be used by all reviewers required to provide a score for an OPMO document, including project managers, project team members, and quality assurance reviewers. Guidelines in italics do not need to be considered by quality assurance reviewers, since they probably do not have the proper background to judge a document in these areas. These guidelines are just guidelines. Reviewers do not have to score a document in each quality dimension; they only need to provide one overall score. These guidelines are intended to help reviewers articulate and justify their reasoning for the overall score. Table 35: Document Scoring Guidelines

Critical Design Review Process

1

Purpose of the Process
The Critical Design Review (CDR) is a formal review that evaluates the technical adequacy of the architecture and design of a system under development. The CDR is conducted live before a panel of IT subject matter experts (SMEs) who determine whether the system design can be implemented on the selected platform, accounts for all functional and technical requirements, and is consistent with the OCC Enterprise Architecture (EA).

1.1

Scope of the Process
The Critical Design Review is defined as a formal SDLC Technical Review. Technical reviews are applicable to all system development projects at OCC, but it can be tailored out of the project plan based on business needs and constraints, on the recommendation of the ITS Project Manager (ITS PM) with the approval of the PMO Program Manager (PMO PM). It is useful to note some additional characteristics of the CDR process, and about SDLC technical reviews, in general: ˇ The duration of a technical review will generally be several hours (two hours is ideal). A technical review should be concise and targeted. The focus among participants should be on achieving consensus on the action items that are needed to address the technical issues and risks that were identified during the meeting. The CDR process itself can be tailored by a project manager to suit business needs/constraints. Additional tailoring flexibilities include: ˇ Modifying what materials will serve as inputs to the process ˇ Modifying what content will be presented during a review ˇ Changing the activities that will be conducted before, during, and after the review meeting ˇ Changing the roles and assigning the participants for the review The CDR can be structured as a prototype demonstration, if the project approach involves iterative refinement of the design through a working prototype.

ˇ

ˇ

1.2

Key Definitions
ˇ Design Risk: A condition wherein the system design will fail to adequately address a requirement from a technical perspective. All design risks identified through the CDR process must be resolved, and any rework may be formally reviewed at the discretion of the Review Leader or ITS PM of the system under review.

1.3

Preconditions
A high degree of advance planning and coordination is required to attain quality results. The following conditions should be established for a project before the CDR is conducted: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ The ITS PM and PMO PM should complete SDLC tailoring in order to formally verify whether the CDR will be included in the project's work plan. The ITS PM and PMO PM should include time and resource requirements for the full CDR process when estimating the project schedule. When the baseline work plan is complete, the ITS PM should have a kick-off meeting with stakeholders in ITS. The ITS PM should provide estimated dates for the CDR if it is tailored into the plan. The ITS PM should work with the ITS Quality Management (ITS QM) department to communicate and/or train ITS personnel on how to provide effective feedback, before and during the technical review process.

Activities
The CDR process consists of three general stages, with activities conducted before, during, and after the review. This section provides detail about each activity including a brief description of its purpose, a summary of roles, a list of tasks, and references to artifacts supporting the activity.

5.1

Plan Review (WBS 3.6.1)

This step ensures that the objectives and agenda for the CDR meeting are established, the participants are identified and confirmed, and the inputs are prepared for distribution. This activity should be conducted well in advance (e.g. at least two weeks before the desired meeting date) to allow adequate time for preparation and scheduling. The review leader fills the primary role, performing the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Collect CDR inputs from development project team members and prepare artifacts to facilitate examination by reviewers Develop and document CDR objectives and review procedures, including criteria for examining inputs and logging design issues and risks Determine individual review participants and assign to CDR roles; if a conflict prevents an individual from participating, he or she should assign an alternative representative or proxy Schedule meeting and announce details to participants Distribute CDR inputs and supporting artifacts to participants for examination.

5.2

Examine Inputs Prior to Review Meeting (WBS 3.6.2)

This step establishes a common understanding of the system design among participants, and serves to document issues and risks that reviewers want to discuss during the review meeting. This activity should be conducted with enough lead-time before the review to give reviewers adequate time to go through inputs and formulate topics for discussion. The following roles perform these tasks: ˇ ˇ Technical SMEs individually examine CDR inputs, record issues and risks based on their area of technical expertise, and return feedback to the review leader The review leader consolidates the examination results, using the Action Log template.

5.3

Create Review Materials (WBS 3.6.3)

This step accounts for the organization of material for the review meeting. This activity should be conducted before the review meeting. The review leader performs these tasks:

Information Technology Services

Comptroller of the Currency

SDLC Manual 3.1.1

ˇ ˇ ˇ

Prepare CDR briefing by leveraging meeting objectives, CDR inputs, and examination results from technical SMEs Meet to examine review materials and finalize meeting procedures with individual assigned to decision maker role Provide project team members with review materials, allowing them to address or develop responses to issues and risks raised by technical SMEs when they examined the inputs.

5.4

Conduct Critical Design Review (WBS 3.6.4)

This step ensures that system design details are presented to technical SMEs, in order to elicit issues and risks with the design, development plan, or other attributes of the project. Participants perform the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Review leader and decision maker call meeting to order and present procedures plus meeting objectives Review leader coordinates the presentation of the system design briefing, highlighting topics raised by technical SMEs during pre-examination of inputs Technical SMEs provide comment and feedback, elaborating on existing issues and risks, as well as identifying additional ones Review leader and decision maker provide guidance, as necessary, while the meeting is in progress; any topics needing closure before the meeting ends are reviewed before the meeting is adjourned Review leader or an assigned recorder records meeting minutes Review leader or recorder populates the Action Log with issues and risks raised during the discussion Review leader obtains clarification from technical SMEs as needed.

5.5

Determine Issue Resolution Plan (WBS 3.6.5)

This step establishes actionable plans for resolving system design issues and risks that are recorded during the review meeting. This activity should be conducted before the meeting is adjourned. Participants collaborate on these tasks as follows: ˇ Review leader leads attendees through a review of items documented in the Action Log; for each item classified as a design risk (meaning it is an event that has not yet occurred), the group will prioritize each risk by impact and probability; resolution actions, action owners, and target completion dates should be assigned to each line item Review leader references "significant design risk" criteria in order to help determine if any issues qualify* Decision maker provides concurrence ­ and authority if needed ­ for risk categorization/prioritization and resolution planning

Critical Design Review Process

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

If necessary, review leader postpones resolution planning for any issues or risks on which the audience concurs more information is required from members of staff not present; relevant follow-up actions must be noted If necessary, review leader identifies any issues or risks needing to be deferred to senior management for resolution Review leader or recorder documents the discussion by populating the Action Log and CDR Report Review leader determines the conclusion of the meeting and cedes the floor to the decision maker Decision maker formally closes the meeting by reviewing the CDR Report with attendees, soliciting concurrence on the final disposition of the outcome, and signing the report.

* Note: If any risks raised pose a "significant design risk," then the decision maker can choose to recommend that the project team halt its progress in order to fix the design flaws and re-validate the design before proceeding. This condition requires the project team to redo the CDR process, once the design adjustments have been made and documented.

5.6

Distribute Review Results (WBS 3.6.6)

This step accounts for the distribution of meeting outputs to project stakeholders. It ensures there is a common understanding of action items and key milestones needed to conclude Design Phase activities, in order to proceed into the next life cycle phase, Development. This activity should be conducted after the review meeting is adjourned. Note that it is the responsibility of the review leader, working with the project manager(s) as necessary, to track all action items on the completed Action Log through to completion after the CDR process concludes. The review leader, with the assistance of recorder, completes the following tasks: ˇ ˇ Finalizes the meeting minutes and Action Log Distributes review outputs and verifies receipt by all participants.

6

Process Roles
Roles, potential actors, and responsibilities are shown in the table below. Note that several roles are listed as alternative roles. The review leader should determine whether or not to include these roles, depending on the scope and content of the planned review.

Release Readiness Review Process

1

Purpose of the Process
The Release Readiness Review (RRR), also referred to as "Go/No Go," ensures that the system is ready for deployment. Specifically, it verifies that the system has passed all testing, implementation planning is adequate, and deployment risks are within an acceptable range. The focus of the process is a review meeting conducted live before a panel of IT subject matter experts (SME) in order to uncover and address issues not sufficiently addressed in the systems development project documentation up to that point. The RRR must take place before a release can be moved to production.

1.1

Scope of the Process
The RRR is defined as a formal SDLC Technical Review. Technical Reviews are applicable to all system development projects at OCC, but can be tailored out of the project plan based on business needs and constraints, on the recommendation of the ITS Project Manager (ITS PM) with the approval of the PMO Program Manager (PMO PM) and ITS Solutions Assurance (SA). It is useful to note some additional characteristics of the RRR process, and about SDLC technical reviews, in general: ˇ While ITS SA has published detailed procedures for the RRR milestone, the SDLC program provides this document as a complement to SA governance. The SDLC view is an end-to-end process description that ties together procedures from multiple IT disciplines that intersect at the RRR milestone. There are three stages to a Technical Review process ­ planning the review, conducting the review meeting, and concluding the review. While the duration of the technical review meeting may be an hour or more, the end-to-end process may take a week or more to complete successfully with a high level of quality. A Technical Review should be concise and targeted. The focus among participants should be on achieving consensus on the action items that are needed to address the technical issues and risks that were identified during the meeting. The RRR process itself can be tailored to some degree by a project manager to suit business needs/constraints. However, because of process efficiency goals within SA, any tailoring to the RRR meeting must be verified and agreed to with SA representatives, in advance. If agreed to, additional tailoring flexibilities include: ˇ Modifying what materials will serve as inputs to the process ˇ Modifying what content will be presented during a review ˇ Changing the activities that will be conducted before, during, and after the review meeting ˇ Changing the roles and assigning the participants for the review.

Preconditions
A high degree of advance planning and coordination is required to attain quality results. The following conditions should be established for a project before any Technical Review is conducted: ˇ ˇ Before the SDLC Planning phase, the ITS PM and PMO PM should complete SDLC tailoring in order to formally verify whether the RRR will be included in the project's work plan. When conducting SDLC tailoring as well as when updating project plans, the ITS PM and PMO PM should include time and resource requirements for the full technical review process when estimating the project schedule. When the baseline work plan is complete, the ITS PM should have a kick-off meeting with stakeholders in ITS. The ITS PM should provide estimated dates for the RRR if it is tailored into the plan. The ITS PM should work with the ITS Quality Management (ITS QM) department to communicate and/or train ITS personnel on how to provide effective feedback, before and during the technical review process.

Comptroller of the Currency

SDLC Manual 3.1.1

Release Readiness Review Process

each activity in the RRR process including a brief description of its purpose, a summary of roles, a list of tasks, and references to artifacts supporting the activity.

5.1

Plan Review (WBS 5.5.1)

This step ensures that the process entry criteria have been met, objectives and agenda for the RRR meeting are established, the participants are identified and confirmed, and the inputs are prepared for distribution. This activity should be conducted well in advance (e.g., at least two weeks before the desired meeting date) to allow adequate time for preparation and scheduling. The review leader fills the primary role, performing the following tasks: ˇ Confirm that testing objectives have been met and all required parties are ready to review results for acceptance; if any outstanding test problem reports are deemed unacceptable, cancel or postpone the RRR until fixes are in place and tested with the desired results If applicable, confirm that system certification and accreditation is complete, and that a signed "Authority to Operate" (ATO) decision is on file with IRM Collect review inputs from development and test team members, and prepare artifacts to facilitate examination by reviewers Develop and document review objectives and procedures, including criteria for examining inputs and logging issues and risks Determine individual review participants and assign to review roles; if a conflict prevents an individual from participating, he or she should assign an alternative representative or proxy Schedule meeting and announce details to participants Distribute inputs and supporting artifacts to participants for examination.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

5.2

Examine Inputs Prior to Review Meeting (WBS 5.5.2)

This step establishes a common understanding of the system test results and implementation plan among participants, and serves to capture issues and risks that reviewers will discuss during the review meeting. This activity should be conducted with enough lead-time before the review to give reviewers adequate time to go through inputs and formulate topics for discussion. The following roles perform these tasks: ˇ ˇ Technical SMEs individually examine review inputs, record issues and risks based on their area of technical expertise, and return feedback to the review leader The review leader consolidates the examination results, using the Action Log template if necessary.

5.3

Create Review Materials (WBS 5.5.3)

This step accounts for the organization of material for the review meeting. This activity should be conducted before the review meeting. The review leader performs these tasks: ˇ ˇ Populate RRR Checklist with meeting information, list of reviewers, list of inputs provided to reviewers, and list of review objectives Prepare review package to include RRR Checklist, a Review Action Log highlighting any issues raised by technical SMEs when examining review inputs, and any additional material needed to facilitate discussion of test results and implementation plan Meet to examine review materials and finalize meeting procedures with individual assigned to decision maker role Provide project team members with review materials, allowing them to address or develop responses to issues and risks raised by technical SMEs when they examined the inputs.

ˇ ˇ

5.4

Conduct Release Readiness Review (WBS 5.5.4)

This step ensures that review materials are presented to technical SMEs, in order to elicit concurrence with test results, implementation plan, or other attributes of the project. See SA for detailed guidance on conducting RRR meetings. Participants perform the following tasks: ˇ ˇ ˇ Review leader and decision maker call meeting to order and present procedures plus meeting objectives Review leader coordinates the presentation of the review package Technical SMEs analyze review materials to assess whether testing was successful and reflective of the system's performance in the production environment; to determine the adequacy of implementation plan and system conversion procedures; and to concur that the system has met security requirements. Technical SMEs provide comment and feedback, elaborating on existing issues and risks, as well as identifying additional ones Review leader and decision maker provide guidance, as necessary, while the meeting is in progress; any topics needing closure before the meeting ends are reviewed before the meeting is adjourned Review leader or an assigned recorder record meeting minutes Review leader or recorder populate the Action Log with issues and risks raised during the discussion Review leader obtains clarification from technical SMEs as needed.

5.5

Determine Issue Resolution Plan (WBS 5.5.5)

This step establishes actionable plans for resolving issues and risks that are recorded during the review meeting. This activity should be conducted before the meeting is adjourned. Participants collaborate on these tasks as follows: ˇ Review leader leads attendees through a review of items documented in the Action Log, including any added during the course of the meeting; for each item classified as a risk (meaning it is an event that has not yet occurred), the group will prioritize each risk by impact and probability; resolution actions, action owners, and target completion dates should be assigned to each line item Decision Maker provides concurrence ­ and authority if needed ­ for risk categorization/prioritization and resolution planning If necessary, review leader postpones resolution planning for any issues or risks on which the audience concurs more information is required from members of staff not present; relevant follow-up actions must be noted If necessary, review leader identifies any issues or risks needing to be deferred to senior management for resolution Review leader or recorder documents the discussion by populating the Action Log and RRR Checklist Review leader determines the conclusion of the meeting and cedes the floor to the decision maker Decision maker formally closes the meeting by reviewing the RRR Checklist with attendees, soliciting concurrence on the final disposition of the outcome (i.e., "Go/No Go" decision), and signing the RRR Checklist.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

5.6

Distribute Review Results (WBS 5.5.6)

This step accounts for the distribution of meeting outputs to project stakeholders. It ensures there is a common understanding of action items and key milestones needed to complete Test Phase activities, in order to proceed into the next life cycle phase, Implementation. This activity should be conducted after the review meeting is adjourned. Note that it is the responsibility of the review leader, working with the project manager(s) as necessary, to track all action items on the completed Action Log through to completion after the review process concludes. The review leader, with the assistance of recorder, completes the following tasks: ˇ ˇ Finalize the meeting minutes and Action Log Distribute review outputs and verify receipt by all participants.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
(1) Why does the OCC require its service providers to complete this self assessment questionnaire? The E-Government Act of 2002 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directives require that all information systems that process government information maintain adequate security. "Adequate security" is commensurate with the harm that would result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of information. Adequate security ensures that systems and applications operate effectively and provide appropriate measures of confidentiality, integrity, and availability through the use of managerial, operational, and technical security controls. This requirement applies to all information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the government, including those provided or managed by another government agency, contractor, or other source. (2) What does "information security" mean? "Information security" is protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. (3) What does "information system" mean? An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, transmission, and dissemination of information, in accordance with defined procedures, whether automated or manual. (4) What do the terms "confidentiality, integrity and availability" mean? Confidentiality is preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. Integrity is protecting information from improper modification or destruction, and includes ensuring that information is authentic and reliable. Availability is ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information. (5) How does the government define "security control"? The OCC's information security controls are based on Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 200. Security controls are the management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a system and its information. Management controls focus on the management of risk and the management of information system security. Operational controls are those safeguards that are primarily implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). Technical controls are primarily implemented and executed by an information system through mechanisms in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system.

(7) What is FIPS 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems," and where can I find more information about it? That publication is a mandatory standard (it cannot be waived) developed in response to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. The combination of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 establishes the foundation for most federal information security practices and procedures. (6) What is NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Revision II, "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems," December 2007 and where can I find more information on it? That publication provides guidelines for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government. These guidelines apply to all components of an information system that process, store, or transmit federal information. The publication provides guidance to federal agencies implementing FIPS 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems." (8) What are the standards and guides used to create this preliminary self-assessment? This questionnaire is derived from FIPS PUB 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems." (9) Can a service provider obtain the standards and guides? NIST information security-related publications can be obtained free of charge from the NIST public Web site located at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/index.html. NIST maintains a complete library of standards and guides federal agencies are required to implement and comply with at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMAMA/fisma/library.html. (10) Where can I get assistance if I need help completing this assessment? If you have any questions concerning the completion of this form, please contact the OCC Information Security Office at (202) 874-4480.

CONDITIONAL ACCESS TO SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
I, _____________________, hereby consent to the terms in this Agreement in consideration of my being granted conditional access to certain United States Government documents or material containing sensitive but unclassified information. I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions: 1. By being granted conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is any information, the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or unauthorized disclosure or modification of which could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs including information covered by 18 U.S.C. '' 1905 and 1906, or the proprietary interests of national banks or their customers or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Title 5 U.S.C. ' 552a, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. I am being granted conditional access contingent upon my execution of this Agreement for the sole purpose of work performed under Contract No.____________________. This approval will permit me conditional access to certain information, including but not limited to, documents, memoranda, reports and/or to attend meetings in which such information is discussed or otherwise made available to me. This Agreement will not allow me access to materials which the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has predetermined, in its sole discretion, is inappropriate for disclosure pursuant to this Agreement. This may include sensitive but unclassified information provided to the OCC by other agencies of the United States Government. I will never divulge any sensitive but unclassified information which is provided to me pursuant to this Agreement to any person, unless I have been advised in writing by the OCC that the individual is authorized to receive it. Unless expressly authorized by the OCC, I will not use any sensitive but unclassified information for any commercial or other purpose other than that for which access to such information is provided under Contract No.____________________. I agree that I must seek and obtain the prior written approval of the OCC for any proposed disclosure or use. Additionally, I will submit to the OCC for security review, prior to any submission for publication, any book, article, column or other written work for general publication that is based upon any knowledge I obtained during the course of my work on Contract No.____________________ in order for the OCC to ensure that no sensitive but unclassified information is disclosed. I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of sensitive but unclassified information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement. If I am permitted, at the sole discretion of the OCC, to review any official documents containing sensitive but unclassified information, such review will be conducted at a secure facility or under circumstances which will maintain the security protection of such material. I will not be permitted to and will not make any copies of documents or parts of documents to which conditional access is granted to me. Any notes taken during the course of such access will remain at the OCC to be placed in secure storage unless it is determined by OCC officials that the notes contain no sensitive but unclassified information. If I wish to have the notes released to me, OCC officials will review the notes for purposes of deleting any sensitive but unclassified information to create a redacted copy of the notes. If I do not wish a review of any notes that I make, those notes will remain sealed in secure storage at the OCC. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I understand that the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive but unclassified information could compromise the mission and security of the OCC. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to OCC information, both classified and sensitive but unclassified, in the future. If I

violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the United States may institute a civil action for damages or any other appropriate relief. The willful disclosure of information to which I have agreed therein not to divulge may constitute a criminal offense. Unless and until I am provided a written release by the OCC from this Agreement or any portions of it, all conditions and obligations contained in this Agreement apply both during my period of conditional access, which shall terminate at the conclusion of my work on Contract No.____________________, and at all times thereafter. 10. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. I understand that the United States Government may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement, including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting use or disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government does not waive any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that it may assert in any administrative or court proceedings to protect any sensitive but unclassified information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with , or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights or liabilities created by Executive order 12356; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health and safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 U.S.C. 421 et seq.)(governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents), and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. Section 783(b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions and liabilities created by the Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this Agreement and are controlling. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or nondisclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government. I make this Agreement in good faith, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.

Project Background

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Critical Infrastructure Protection and Security (CIPS) organization plans to implement a new system, known as the CIPS Personnel Tracking System (PTS), to replace its collection of existing systems, improve business processes, and enhance data management. Today, CIPS uses a number of disconnected systems--Microsoft (MS) Excel, MS Access, and Lotus Notes--to manage personnel security actions and information. The ad hoc and disconnected nature of these systems results in a number of problems, including: Redundant Data Entry Lack of automated interfaces between the existing systems causes redundant data entry, which results in an inefficient use of staff time and increases the likelihood of data errors. Lack of a Central Data Repository for Contractors The OCC does not currently have a central system of record for contractor information. The lack of this type of central database means that data routinely becomes out-of-sync between the current systems, which reduces data quality and increases the effort required to use the information. Labor-Intensive Reporting The disconnected nature of the existing systems results in manual data filtering, sorting, and aggregation to create reports. As a result, creating reports represents a significant work effort each month for CIPS staff. Reduced Focus on Security-Related Work The existing systems require a significant manual effort to complete tasks that are often automated in technologically advanced applications (e.g., data filtering to create meaningful reports). As a result, CIPS personnel are less focused on the core business of security. CIPS PTS includes the system features necessary to support the following personnel security business processes and subprocesses:  Obtain on-boarding information  Process on-boarding request  Determine on-boarding requirements  Finalize on-boarding request  On-board personnel  Establish candidate suitability  Conduct background investigation  Issue OCC credential  Issue national security clearance  Maintain personnel  Conduct reinvestigation  Replace OCC credential  Update personnel information

Performance Work Statement
Objectives

The OCC is issuing this performance work statement (PWS) to design, develop, test, and implement a solution to meet the CIPS PTS requirements. The CIPS PTS solution will address the OCC's business needs by supporting the business processes identified in section 1 with a sustainable, well-architected technical solution. Together, the processes and technology will help OCC manage employee and contractor personnel security throughout the personnel life cycle (i.e., from on-boarding through off-boarding). To meet the project objectives, legacy personnel security data will need to be migrated into CIPS PTS. Table 2-1 identifies the legacy personnel security data that will need to be included in the data conversion task. Table 2-1 Legacy Personnel Security Data
Description Personnel security records Scope All historical records All historical records Historical records from 1 prior year Source Personnel Security (PerSec) Database Credentials Database Notification of Separation Database Format MS Access Approximate Size 8,200 records

OCC credential data Off-boarding data

MS Access Lotus Notes

2,700 records 3,000 records

Additionally, the solution is expected to include a number of automated interfaces, including connections to several systems that reside outside the Department of the Treasury. Specifically, the Personnel Investigations Processing System (PIPS) is managed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the USAccess system is managed by the General Services Administration (GSA). Table 2-2 provides background information for the planned CIPS PTS interfaces. Additionally, the contractor shall refer to Appendix F for the to-be CIPS PTS context diagram, Appendix D for the functional requirements, and Appendix E for the supplementary requirements. Table 2-2 CIPS PTS Interfaces
Interfacing System C*Cure Managed By OCC Description C*Cure is OCC's physical access control system. It is used to program and print OCC security badges, encode physical access panels, and monitor personnel entry into and exit from secured areas. Refer to http://www.swhouse.com/products/software_home.aspx for information about C*Cure.

Interfacing System Employee Contact Information (ECI) Database HRHub Managed By OCC

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

Description ECI is an OCC database that consolidates employee contact data from several disconnected sources. HRHub is an OCC data warehouse that stores data from HRConnect for access by external applications. HRConnect is OCC's human resource (HR) system that provides a broad range of HR-related applications, services, and data to HR offices, employees, and managers. I-PRO is an OCC procurement system. Exchange is OCC's messaging and calendaring solution. PIPS is an OPM application used to verify the status of background investigations. Remedy is an OCC system used to track a variety of IT requests. CIPS uses Remedy to review and process employee and contractor requests for access to IT resources. TEDS is a central directory for Treasury employees and contractors. TEDS contains names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and digital certificates. TEDS connects disparate directory sources from the various Treasury bureaus, who maintain their own information, into one comprehensive directory. In this manner, TEDS serves as the authoritative source of directory information for the entire Treasury. USAccess is a shared end-to-end solution for issuing Personal Identity Verification (PIV), or SmartID, cards as mandated by Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD12). The GSA Managed Service Office (MSO) USAccess program allows civilian agencies and commissions to share a common identity management infrastructure for the issuance of HSPD-12 compliant credentials.

3.1

Constraints and Technical Considerations
Constraints

The contractor shall consider the following when developing their proposal.  The contractor shall be responsible for purchasing software on the government's behalf. The government shall retain ownership of all software.  The government shall purchase all hardware required to support the solution. The contractor shall provide the required hardware specifications to the government during the project's design phase. The contractor shall refer to the individual task descriptions in section 4 for task-specific constraints.

3.2

Technical Considerations

The contractor shall consider the following technical considerations when developing their proposal. 3.2.1 Object-Oriented Analysis and Design The OCC intends to follow an object-oriented analysis and design methodology on this project. Where applicable, project artifacts shall comply with Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.0. If the contractor's proposed solution relies on a different analysis and design methodology, its technical approach should clearly explain the advantages of using that methodology. 3.2.2 Common Interface Layer The OCC desires a solution that provides a common interface layer for interfacing CIPS PTS with external systems. Such a layer might be based on web services or other common application integration methods. The OCC also realizes, however, that all interfaces might not be able to take advantage of a common interface layer due to technical limitations of the system to which CIPS PTS is interfacing. The solution shall balance the desire for a common interface layer with practical technical limitations. 3.2.3 Maximized Use of COTS Components The OCC desires a solution that employs commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components to the greatest extent possible and minimizes the need for custom code.

Tasks

This section defines specific tasks the OCC believes contractors shall need to complete to deliver a CIPS PTS solution. The deliverables required by each task are included in the task definition. Contractors have the latitude to propose a different set of tasks and deliverables. See the instructions to contractors included with the solicitation package for more information. The OCC requires as many tasks as possible to be fixed price, but recognizes that uncertainty in task scope and other factors may require labor hour pricing for some tasks, so a pricing method has been specified for each task. Tasks 5, 7, 13, and 14 will be awarded at the option of the OCC. Current uncertainty in some technical requirements makes it difficult to determine whether these tasks will be necessary. At time of award, the OCC may designate other tasks as optional due to funding limitations. Please refer to section 5 for additional information about each deliverable.

4.1

Design--Phase I

4.1.1 Task 1 Develop the CIPS PTS System Architecture The contractor shall develop the CIPS PTS system architecture. The objective of this task is to produce a set of architecture diagrams that present a well-defined, logically organized view of the production system architecture. This task includes the identification and description of the software and hardware components that comprise the CIPS PTS system. The CIPS PTS architecture needs to include all significant architectural elements including:  Server and network hardware  Custom software components  COTS software components, including databases, middleware (integration layer) components, and other COTS software components in the solution, such as workflow engines, business rules engines, business process management systems, etc. The contractor shall work with the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) to confirm the notation, format, and level of detail to be used for the system architecture diagrams. The CIPS PTS system architecture will consist of three different views: Logical Network View The logical network view will depict the design of the CIPS PTS network. The contractor shall develop the logical network view using MS Visio. The network diagram will identify and map the connections between server and network hardware and will depict where the hardware resides in relation to the internal OCC network and the Internet.

September 9, 2009 Version 2.0

CIPS Personnel Tracking System Systems Integration PWS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

Logical Server View The logical server view will identify the server hardware needed for CIPS PTS. The contractor shall develop a UML deployment diagram to represent this view. The diagram will identify the required server hardware, the software that will be installed on that hardware, and the middleware that will be used to connect the servers to one another. Logical Software Architecture View The logical software architecture view will identify the software components needed for the CIPS PTS production environment. The contractor shall develop a UML component diagram to depict the software architecture. The component diagram will identify the software components and depict the interactions among those components. As required deliverables for this task, the contractor shall develop the system architecture diagrams for CIPS PTS and a supporting document in MS Word. The system architecture diagrams will consist of the logical network view, logical server view, and logical software architecture view in native format (e.g., MS Visio or Rational Software Modeler). The MS Word document will comprehensively describe the CIPS PTS system architecture. 4.1.2 Task 2 Design and Build Non-Production CIPS PTS Environments The contractor shall develop requirements, design, and build the CIPS PTS non-production environments. The objective of this task is to produce a diagram that presents a well-defined, logically organized view of the non-production environments. This task includes the identification and description of the hardware and tools that are needed to support the CIPS PTS nonproduction environments. The contractor shall work with the COTR to confirm the notation, format, and level of detail to be used for the environment diagram. As required deliverables for this task, the contractor shall develop the environment diagram for CIPS PTS and a supporting document in MS Word. The environment diagram will depict the CIPS PTS non-production environments. The MS Word document will comprehensively describe the requirements for the CIPS PTS non-production environments. 4.1.3 Task 3 Design Relational Database The contractor shall design the logical data model and physical data model for the relational databases that support CIPS PTS. The contractor shall use ER/Studio Embarcadero to design the models. As required deliverables for this task, the contractor shall develop the CIPS PTS logical data model and the CIPS PTS physical data model. The deliverable will consist of the data models in native format, along with an MS Word document that describes key aspects of each model. 4.1.4 Task 4 Design Graphical User Interfaces The contractor shall design the graphical user interfaces used to interact with CIPS PTS. The graphical user interface design must consider, at a minimum, the following elements:

September 9, 2009 Version 2.0

CIPS Personnel Tracking System Systems Integration PWS  Dialog layout and format  Data entry (e.g., data-entry controls, mandatory fields)  Navigation and support controls

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

For estimating purposes, the contractor can assume that this design task includes:  Individual dialog designs for each use case  One storyboard design for each use case  One navigation map for CIPS PTS As a required deliverable for this task, the contractor shall develop the CIPS PTS graphical user interface design document. The deliverable will consist of the dialog designs, storyboards, and navigation map in native format(s), along with an MS Word document that describes key components of the design. 4.1.5 Design System-to-System Interfaces The contractor shall design the system-to-system interfaces for CIPS PTS. The sub-sections below identify the specific interface design tasks. Refer to section 12 of the supplementary requirements document (Appendix E) for the general interface requirements.

Deliverable Quality Scores

Deliverables provided under this contract shall be assigned a deliverable quality score, as identified in the "Scored" column of Table 5-1. Scores for these deliverables will be used to calculate the monthly deliverable quality performance measure, one of the key performance metrics for this contract. For estimating purposes, the contractor shall assume that updates to scored deliverables done under tasks 17, 20, 26, and 30 will be scored. However, the COTR will ultimately determine whether an update will be subject to a deliverable quality score. The COTR will inform the con-

CIPS Personnel Tracking System Systems Integration PWS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

tractor whether an update is subject to a deliverable quality score at least two weeks in advance of the due date for the management review draft. Appendix T contains the scoring guidelines.

5.2

Deliverable Review Process

All deliverables undergo some level of review before the COTR accepts them. The deliverable review process differs somewhat for scored and unscored documents. The process differences essentially come down to the number of drafts and revisions the contractor is required to deliver and perform. A scored deliverable requires delivery of four distinct versions and has four delivery milestones associated with it: 1. 2. 3. 4. Delivery of the management review draft Delivery of the quality assurance review draft Delivery of the OPMO-customer review draft Delivery of the final document

An unscored deliverable requires delivery of two distinct versions and has two delivery milestones associated with it: 1. Delivery of the management review draft 2. Delivery of the final document These delivery milestones will be used to determine the milestone timeliness performance measure as it is described in section 6.1. Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 have a mix of scored and unscored deliverables. For each of these tasks the deliverables shall be delivered as a package. For scheduling purposes the contractor can assume that for each of these tasks, milestone 2 (i.e., delivery of the final document) for the unscored deliverable(s) will coincide with milestone 4 (i.e., delivery of the final document) for the scored deliverable. The minimum number of business days the OCC will have to review and comment on a draft and the minimum number of days the contractor shall have to revise a draft are shown in Table 5-2. The COTR may increase these times by as much as three days, depending on the length and level of complexity of the deliverable. The COTR will communicate any increases in these times at least two weeks in advance of the due date for the draft.

After receiving the OCC's comments on a draft, the contractor shall: 1. Consolidate comments received from the document reviewers 2. Review and suggest a resolution for each comment 3. As necessary, work with the OPMO CIPS PTS Program Manager, COTR, and document reviewers to resolve comments 4. Obtain the OPMO CIPS PTS Program Manager's approval for all comment resolutions 5. Revise the document within the timeframe allowed for the revision Generally, there are one or two reviewers for each draft. However, drafts for longer or more complex deliverables could have as many as a dozen reviewers. The COTR will require the contractor to rework and resubmit deliverables that are incomplete, are of such poor quality that they are essentially incomplete, do not sufficiently incorporate OCC feedback from a previous draft, or receive a deliverable quality score less than 3. Such deliverables will be considered late for purposes of the milestone timeliness performance measure (section 6.1). The requirement to rework and resubmit a deliverable under these circumstances applies to both deliverables that are subject to a quality score and deliverables that are not subject to a quality score. Refer to section 6.2 for more information about deliverable quality scores.

5.3

Submission of Deliverables

For purposes of formal delivery, all deliverables shall be provided by e-mail to the COTR, the OPMO Program Manager, and the Contract Specialist. The COTR may also require submission via e-mail to other OCC individuals and will provide instructions accordingly at time of delivery.

5.4

Billing Schedule for Fixed Price Tasks

Payments for fixed price tasks will be made in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 52.232-1. Payments are tied to acceptance of the deliverables. Payment amounts are shown in Table 5-3. Charges for fixed price tasks shall appear on the monthly invoice for the month deliverables are accepted in accordance with the criteria in Table 5-3 and FAR 52.246-4.

Performance Measures and Acceptance Standards

As described in Table 6-1, the OCC's performance objectives for the CIPS PTS project are to deliver the project on schedule with a high level of quality. To measure performance against these objectives, the OCC will evaluate the contractor using two performance measures: milestone timeliness and deliverable quality. On a monthly basis, the COTR will calculate these measures and the Contracting Officer will report them to the contractor. Table 6-1 CIPS PTS Performance Objectives
Performance Objective On Schedule Performance Measure Milestone Timeliness Performance Standard CIPS PTS deliverables will be delivered to the OCC in accordance with the baseline project schedule. CIPS PTS documentation deliverables will be of high quality. CIPS PTS software/systems deliverables will be of high quality. Acceptable Quality Level Deliverables are delivered early or on time Documentation deliverables receive a quality score of `3' or higher Software/systems deliverables are accepted Monitoring Method See Section 6.1 Incentives/ Disincentives See Section 6.4, Table 6-5

6.1

Milestone Timeliness

The milestone timeliness performance measure is the ratio of actual milestones completed on time to the total number of planned contractual milestones in a given month. The computation of the measure is as follows: t = number of timely milestones for the month / total milestones for that month. The milestone timeliness ratio will be translated into a monthly milestone timeliness measure, according to the criteria in Table 6-2. Table 6-2 Milestone Timeliness Performance Standards
Expected Target Milestone Timeliness Ratio3 Description Monthly Milestone Timeliness Measure t = 1.0 100% of all contractual milestones are completed on or before the due date. 3 Below Target 1.0 > t >= 0.8 80.0% - 99.9% of all contractual milestones are completed on or before the due date. 2 Poor 0.8 > t Less than 80.0% of all contractual milestones are completed on or before the due date. 1

Traditional rounding rules will apply when determining the range. The value will be rounded up when the second decimal place is a 5 or greater, and the value will be rounded down then the second decimal place is less than 5. 32 September 9, 2009 Version 2.0

CIPS Personnel Tracking System Systems Integration PWS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

Please note that when the contractor expects to be late in the completion of a milestone, the OCC expects written notice via e-mail that the milestone will be missed. Notice must be provided as soon as the contractor is aware of the delay. Please note that the contractor shall not be penalized in the event deliverables are delayed due to untimely response from the government.

6.2

Deliverable Quality

The deliverable quality performance measure gauges the level of quality of deliverables provided to the OPMO. For each deliverable subject to a quality score, the COTR will assign one deliverable quality score, based on the guidelines described in Appendix T and, as necessary, input from reviews of the deliverable. Table 6-3 identifies the deliverable quality scores that will be used for this contract. Table 6-3 Deliverable Quality Scores
Deliverable Quality Score 5 4 3 2 1 Description Excellent Above average Satisfactory Needs improvement Unsatisfactory Rework and Resubmission Required? No No No Yes Yes

Deliverables receiving a score of 2 (needs improvement) or 1 (unsatisfactory) will require rework and resubmission. The contractor shall continue to submit revised deliverables to the COTR until the deliverable receives a minimum score of 3 (satisfactory). For the purposes of computing the monthly deliverable quality score, the score recorded for that deliverable will be the score awarded to the original submission (i.e., the original "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory" score). At the end of each month, the COTR will average the deliverable quality scores: a = (deliverable quality score1 + . . . + deliverable quality scoren) / n. The monthly average of deliverable quality scores will be translated into a monthly deliverable quality measure, according to the criteria in Table 6-4. Table 6-4 Deliverable Quality Performance Standards

5.0>= a >= 4.3

4.3 > a >= 3.5

3.5 > a >= 3.0

Deliverable Acceptance

With the exception of deliverables 18.1 and 28.3, deliverables will be accepted based on the deliverable review process described in section 5.2. The sections below describe the acceptance criteria for deliverables 18.1 and 28.3. For the purpose of acceptance of deliverables 18.1 and 28.3, the term "critical defect" means a problem that prevents any CIPS PTS use case from being executed or compromises the integrity of CIPS PTS data. (Use cases are defined in the functional requirements document.) For the purpose of acceptance of deliverables 18.1 and 28.3, the term "non-critical defect" means a problem that is not a critical defect, including a problem that prevents the system from meeting a requirement, hinders a user's ability to use the system, or hinders the proper operation of the system. 6.3.1 Deliverable 18.1 OCC will accept the draft deliverable 18.1 (Configured System Ready for System Testing) when the following criteria are met:  All critical defects identified as of the end of system testing have been satisfactorily resolved. OCC will accept the final deliverable 18.1 (Configured System Ready for System Testing) when the following criteria are met:  All critical defects identified as of the end of user acceptance testing have been satisfactorily resolved.  All non-critical defects that would prevent proper operation of the system in a production environment have been satisfactorily resolved. 6.3.2 Deliverable 28.3 The OPMO will evaluate acceptance criteria for deliverable 28.3 at the end of the 30-calendar day warranty period. OCC will accept the final deliverable 28.3 (Deployed Production-Ready CIPS PTS Solution) when the following criteria are met:  The production system operates and responds according to the defined performance requirements.  All critical defects identified as of the end of the 30-calendar day warranty period have been satisfactorily resolved.

CIPS Personnel Tracking System Systems Integration PWS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

 Non-critical defects identified as of the end of the 30-calendar day warranty period have been satisfactorily resolved. The COTR will work with the contractor to determine which non-critical production faults will be resolved to satisfy the deliverable acceptance criteria.

6.4

Performance Incentives and Disincentives

The OCC may assess a disincentive under this performance-based contract. Disincentives for document-based deliverables will be determined at the end of each month, based on a review of the monthly milestone timeliness measure and the monthly deliverable quality measure. Refer to Table 6-5 for the contract disincentives associated with this performance-based contract. The disincentive will be based on the invoiced total of the services provided for the month. Table 6-5 Contract Performance Disincentives for Document-Based Deliverables

These guidelines shall be used by all reviewers required to provide a score for an OPMO deliverable, including project managers, project team members, and quality assurance reviewers. Guidelines in italics do not need to be considered by quality assurance reviewers, since they probably do not have the proper background to judge a document in these areas. These guidelines are just guidelines. Reviewers do not have to score a deliverable in each quality dimension; they only need to provide one overall score. These guidelines are intended to help reviewers articulate and justify their reasoning for the overall score.

(3) The prohibitions of the Act do not apply under the following conditions: (i) Agency and legislative liaison by own employees; (A) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in subparagraph (b)(1) of this clause, does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action. (B) For purposes of subdivision (b)(3)(I)(A) of this clause, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is permitted at any time.

34

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND SECURITY PERSONNEL TRACKING SYSTEM ­ CIPS PTS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

(C) The following agency and legislative liaison activities are permitted at any time where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action: (1) Discussing with an agency the qualities and characteristics (including individual demonstrations) of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities. (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use. (D) The following agency and legislative liaison activities are permitted where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action(1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informal decision about initiation of a covered Federal action; (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and (3) Capability presentations by person seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Pub. L. 95-507, and subsequent amendments. (E) Only those services expressly authorized by subdivision (b)(3)(I)(A) of this clause are permitted under this clause. (ii) Professional and technical services.

(A) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds in subparagraph (b)(1) of this clause, does not apply in the case of(1) A payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a covered Federal action, if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal action or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal action. (2) Any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a covered Federal action, if payment is for professional or technical services

35

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND SECURITY PERSONNEL TRACKING SYSTEM ­ CIPS PTS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal action or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal action. Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations. (B) For the purposes of subdivision (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this clause, "professional and technical services" shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying to a professional or technical discipline. The following examples are not intended to be all inclusive, to limit the application of the professional or technical exemption provided in the laws, or to limit the exemption to licensed professionals. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. (C) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation and any other requirements in the actual award documents. (D) Only those services expressly authorized by subdivisions (b)(3)(ii)(A)(1) and (2) of this clause are permitted under this clause. (E) The reporting requirements of FAR 3.803(a) shall not apply with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

(iii) Selling activities by independent sales representatives The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in subparagraph (b)(1) of this clause, does not apply to the following selling activities before an agency by independent sales representatives, provided such activities are prior to formal solicitation by an agency and are specifically limited to the merits of the matter: (A) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sales, and service capabilities; and (B) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use. (C) Disclosure. (1) The Contractor who request or receives from an agency a Federal contract shall file with that agency a disclosure form, OMB standard form LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities, if such person has made or has agreed to make any payment using non-appropriated funds (to include profits from any covered Federal action), which would be prohibited under subparagraph (b)(1) of this clause, if paid for with appropriated funds. (2) The Contractor shall file a disclosure form at the end of each calendar quarter in which there occurs any event that materially affects the accuracy of the information contained in any disclosure form previously filed by such person under subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. An event that materially affects the accuracy of the information reported includes(i) A cumulative increase of $25,000 or more in the amount paid or expected to be paid for influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or (ii) A change in the officer(s) or individual(s) influencing or attempting to influence a covered Federal action; or (iii) A change in the officer(s), or Member(s) contacted to influence or attempt to influence a covered Federal action. (3) The Contractor shall require the submittal of a certification, and if required, a disclosure form by any person who requests or receives any subcontract exceeding $100,000 under the Federal contract. (4) All subcontractor disclosure forms (but not certifications) shall be forwarded from tier to tier until received by the prime Contractor. The prime

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

Contractor shall submit all disclosures to the Contracting Officer at the end of the calendar quarter in which the disclosure form is submitted by the subcontractor. Each subcontractor certification shall be retained in the subcontract file of the awarding Contractor. (d) Agreement. The Contractor agrees not to make any payment prohibited by this clause. (e) Penalties. (1) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited under paragraph (a) of this clause or who fails to file or amend the disclosure form to be filed or amended by paragraph (b) of this clause shall be subject to civil penalties as provided for by 31 U.S.C. 1352. An imposition of a civil penalty does not prevent the Government from seeking any other remedy that may be applicable. (2) Contractors may rely without liability on the representation made by their subcontractors in the certification and disclosure form. (f) Cost allowability. Nothing in this clause makes allowable or reasonable any costs which would otherwise be unallowable or unreasonable. Conversely, costs made specifically unallowable by the requirements in this clause will not be made allowable under any other provision. (End of clause)

FAR 52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 5 days of contract expiration. FAR 52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 1 day prior to the expiration of the contract; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 before the contract expires.

(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 12 months.

FAR 52.222-39 NOTIFICATION OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS CONCERNING PAYMENT OF UNION DUES OR FEES (DEC 2004) (a) Definition. As used in this clause-United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Wake Island. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, during the term of this contract, the Contractor shall post a notice, in the form of a poster, informing employees of their rights concerning union membership and payment of union dues and fees, in conspicuous places in and about all its plants and offices, including all places where notices to employees are customarily posted.

Notice to Employees Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs. Under certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security agreement requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and initiation fees. However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments. For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number: National Labor Relations Board Division of Information

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax

51

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND SECURITY PERSONNEL TRACKING SYSTEM ­ CIPS PTS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-- (1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or (2) o Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] [ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-- (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

Offerors must provide an original and all supporting documentation, along with an electronic copy (CD-Rom), shall be submitted in three-ring, loose-leaf binders. The disk or CD copy shall be formatted in MS Office Version 6 or higher. NOTE: The offeror shall include a separate CD for each volume. All CDs shall include a label identifying the Offeror's name, address and solicitation number. The original proposal shall be clearly labeled accordingly and shall contain the original of all documents requiring signature by the Offeror to include any or all amendment(s). Offerors shall submit proposals consisting of two (2) separate volumes. Volume I the Technical Proposal and Volume II, the Price Proposal. Along with the above requirement an offeror may also submit their proposal via email to Andrea.Katz@occ.treas.gov. Please note that facsimile is not an authorized method for submission. The Offeror shall submit the following sections as part of their proposal. Each section should be distinct, should start on a new page, and should not overlap with other requested concepts. The maximum length for the offeror's Technical Approach , to include both the Technical Approach and Management Approach, is 65 pages, which does not include cover pages, tables of contents, and appendices. Any additional pages beyond the page limit shall not be considered in the evaluation of the proposal. Vendor Response Outline Volume I: PART A - TECHNICAL APPROACH 1. System Architecture Describe the overall architecture for the solution. Identify all commercial software components (e.g., databases, application servers, integration tools, business process management systems, and workflow engines) used in the system. Describe how these components will be integrated to form a complete system solution. Identify the core technologies on which the system depends. The requirements for task 3 might provide a useful guide for deciding how the system architecture should be described in the technical approach 2. Testing Approach Describe the approach for unit and system testing. Identify any testing and configuration management tools that will be used. Discuss the requirements for test environments and how they will be managed. Explain the approach for creating and managing test data. Differences between testing environments and the production environment should be clearly specified 3. Implementation Approach Maximum Page Length 50

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND SECURITY PERSONNEL TRACKING SYSTEM ­ CIPS PTS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

Describe the approach for deploying the CIPS PTS solution into production. If the offeror proposes to use a tool set other than the Rational tools, the implementation approach should explain the impact of using a different tool set 4. Work Breakdown Structure and Project Schedule At a minimum, the work breakdown structure (WBS) and project schedule should include all the milestones identified in the PWS. If offerors wish to decompose the WBS and schedule to a lower level of detail, that is acceptable. In the event an offeror proposes tasks and/or deliverables other than those described in the PWS, the offeror's WBS and project schedule should reflect all the milestones identified as part of that solution. 5. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) As an appendix to these instructions, the OCC is providing a Microsoft Excel extract of the CIPS PTS requirements from the Rational Requisite Pro repository. Offerors should copy the requirements tables from this deliverable and add a column called "Satisfies Requirement?" to each table. Offerors should update this column to indicate whether their proposed solution satisfies each requirement.1 If the solution fully satisfies the requirement without any customization, insert "Meets" in the column. If the solution requires customization to satisfy the requirement fully, then insert "Does Not Meet" in the column. For the purposes of this procurement, offerors should understand "customization" to mean the writing of computer code using one or more programming or scripting languages. Offerors should not confuse "customization" with "configuration." If a requirement can be fully satisfied as the result of a configuration change, and that change can be performed by a system user without the benefit of specialized programming knowledge (e.g., a super-user or system administrator can make the change), then type "Meets" in the "Satisfies Requirement?" column in the RTM spreadsheet.

The OCC anticipates that some, if not all, of the components of an offeror's solution will be commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. If that is not the case and the offeror proposes an entirely custom solution, the OCC will assume that all CIPS PTS requirements will be fully satisfied by the proposed solution. No RTM need be submitted if the offeror proposes such a custom solution.

manage the integration activities for the CIPS PTS project. This methodology should be appropriate for the type of technology and implementation approach that the offeror is proposing. 2. Staffing Approach and Personnel Retention Strategy Please explain how the proposed project team will be staffed and how the team members will be retained to ensure personnel continuity. Describe how knowledge-transfer will be managed in situations where team members depart the project. If some or all of the proposed staff will work off-site (i.e., within a 50-mile radius of the OCC's headquarters) or in a remote location (i.e., outside of that radius), explain how communication between the proposed project team, OCC staff, and other CIPS PTS contractors will be successfully maintained. Describe how any customer-service concerns expressed by the OCC will be addressed when members of the project team are working off site or in a remote location. Resumes For all proposed team members, provide a detailed resume of relevant experience. Each resume should include sufficient information about the individual's professional experience to justify why he/she is being proposed for the team. For each reference to prior job experience, include the employer's name, the dates of employment, the individual's position/role, and a comprehensive--but concise--description of his/her responsibilities. Do not propose as staff resources any individuals who are not currently employed by a member of your project team. 3. Teaming Arrangement Please identify the different vendors who constitute the offeror's project team and describe the relevant capabilities that they bring to the team. For each task, describe what types of services will be provided by each vendor. 4. Compliance Matrix Provide a compliance matrix that demonstrates that all content required in the proposal, as per these instructions, is indeed included in the appropriate proposal volume (i.e., the technical or the cost proposal). 5. Subcontracting Plan Subcontracting Plan (IF APPLICABLE) - The Offeror's subcontracting plan will be evaluated pursuant to FAR 52.2199. Offerors are cautioned that the OCC goals set forth in the subcontracting plan apply to the overall contract. The quality of the Offeror's overall plan will be evaluated including its goals and methods for achieving those goals. The Government will consider the extent to which the plan expresses definitive

VOLUME 1: PART C ­ PAST PERFORMANCE This section shall contain three (3) references for which the Offeror has implemented a similar solution as a prime or a prime with a sub contractor. The past performance references shall be for work of similar size and scope to the effort described in this document. The reference should include a brief characterization of the use of the solution as well as a point of contact, telephone number, email address and dollar value of the contract. The OCC reserves the right to contact other entities not specifically identified by the Offeror in its proposal, or use other sources of information such as published articles, and past performance databases to obtain past performance information. VOLUME 1: PART D ­ DEMONSTRATION AND PRESENTATION The OCC intends to allow each vendor whose proposal is considered to be within the competitive range an opportunity to participate in a one day (nine-hours) presentation/demonstration session in which offeror will give an oral presentation concerning their understanding of the OCC's need, technical approach, and a demonstration of their proof of concept. Once a competitive range has been established and the offerors notified, the offerors shall be given at least 15 business days to develop a proof of concept of their solution. Offerors should make their best efforts to incorporate our requirements into a proposed solution. The objectives of the proof of concept are to (a) demonstrate how the CIPS PTS requirements will be implemented, (b) determine the offeror's understanding of the CIPS PTS requirements, and (c) understand innovative and unique ideas proposed by the offeror's solution. The OCC will not authorize access to OCC equipment and network for the

1 per reference

60

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND SECURITY PERSONNEL TRACKING SYSTEM ­ CIPS PTS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

proof of concept. Offerors shall provide a presentation and demonstration of their proof of concept demonstrating how the proposed solution will meet the OCC's objectives and high-level requirements identified in the FRD. The expectations of the demo/presentation are outlined below: 1) After selection of the competitive range, the OCC will schedule oral presentations and solution demonstrations by drawing lots. Oral presentations and solution demonstrations will be scheduled and begin on the 16th business day after offerors are notified of being within the competitive range. The OCC will advise offerors of the date and time for presentation of their Oral presentations and solution demonstration. The government reserves the right to reschedule oral presentations at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. 2) Offerors shall bring no more than four (4) representatives to the oral presentation, two of whom shall be the proposed project manager and the technical lead. Offerors shall have one ninehour workday to perform an oral presentation of their solution and demonstration of the proof of concept. At least two of the nine hours will be allocated for breaks, leaving seven hours for the presentation/demonstration. The presentation and demonstrations shall be performed within the following parameters: Presentation ­ Factor 5 (After Competitive Range) A limit of one hour can be used by the offeror for an oral presentation. In the oral presentation, the offeror shall address, at a minimum, the following in response to the task: 1) Understanding of the Problem: The offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of the technical and operational problems involved in completing the system. 2) Technical Approach/Performance Plan: The offeror must demonstrate how it intends to successfully execute their technical approach. Technical issues with the proposed solution and risks shall be presented. After completion of the oral presentation, the government may request clarification of any of the points addressed that are unclear and may ask for elaboration by the offeror on any point which was

61

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND SECURITY PERSONNEL TRACKING SYSTEM ­ CIPS PTS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

not adequately supported in the presentation. Any such interchange between the offeror and the government will be for clarification only, and will not constitute discussions within the meaning of FAR 15.306. Demonstration ­Factor 5 (After Competitive Range) The offeror will use the remaining time to demonstrate the proof of concept. During the demonstration of the proof of concept, the offeror must clearly identify the CIPS PTS system features and how they would be implemented in the proposed solution. Offerors in the competitive range will be provided a list of minimum system features that will need to be demonstrated. Offerors are required to create a demonstration script, which can be followed by the attendees and mapped to the system features we will provide. This script must clearly reflect the offeror's understanding of the personnel security process and system requirements and how the solution meets our needs. At the completion of the demonstrations, the Government will apply an adjectival evaluation rating and if the vendor receives a marginal rating or below the OCC reserves the right to remove the vendor's proposal from consideration. Ratings from the presentation/demonstration will be factored into each offerors final rating. VOLUME II: PART A ­ COST PROPOSAL 1. Cost Data for Tasks Please provide costs for each task. For labor-hour tasks, the price proposal should specify, by task, each individual who will work on the task, the individual's role, the individual's labor category, the individual's hourly rate, the total estimated hours the individual will work on the task, the total cost for each individual, and the total price of the task.  Relative Level of Effort for Fixed-Price Tasks ­ The OCC must confirm that the appropriate skill sets are deployed in support of each task. Because this type of information is not otherwise available for fixed-price tasks, the technical approach should provide a relative level of effort (LOE) to describe how labor resources--identified by role--will be assigned to perform each fixed-price task. The relative LOE should be presented in a table, similar in format to the following: [Task Number] [Task Name] Role Name: Staff Name Relative LOE Project Manager: Jane Doe 10%

Business Analyst: Michael 25% Smith Interface Developer: Mary 65% Jones 2. Discounts The cost proposal should clearly indicate any discounts and any other information important to understanding pricing for the tasks. 3. Pricing Assumptions Please list the pricing assumptions associated with each task in the PWS. If there are any pricing assumptions that relate to the entire scope of the PWS, please provide that information as well. Offerors may use Schedule B as a template or propose an alternative pricing schedule. 4. Materials List Please provide cost data for any hardware or software proposed by the offeror and not described in the PWS as part of the current OCC technical environment. 5. Travel Costs If any proposed staff reside more than 50 miles from the OCC's headquarters, please provide information on their travel costs. For each task that the individual will support, indicate the number of trips to the OCC that are proposed. For each trip, provide the estimated costs for transportation, lodging, and per diem. The number of trips proposed for these individuals should be commensurate with their relative level of effort for the tasks they will support PRESENTATIONS / DEMONSTRATIONS The demonstration factor will not be used to determine competitive range. Additional information will be provided once the competitive range is established. SECURITY Factor 6 will only apply to the offeror whose proposal affords the OCC the greatest value to the OCC. Offerors must complete the attached Security Assessment form. End of Section L

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M.1

52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998) This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. The full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://acquisition.gov FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 1) PROVISIONS NUMBER 52.217-5 DATE JUL 1990 TITLE EVALUATION OF OPTIONS

M.2 BASIS FOR AWARD The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria below. The best value tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101-1, permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or the highest technically rated proposal. To be responsive the offeror must address all the requirements of the solicitation and must include all information specifically required in all sections of the solicitation. The offeror must state how it will meet the requirements; repeating back the words of the RFP or responding with product sales literature is not acceptable. The failure of an Offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement of the RFP may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and thus eliminated from the competition. The Government intends to award a single contract. However, no award will be made that is not in the best interest of the Government simply to provide coverage in task areas. M.3 UNREASONABLY LOW HOURLY RATES ON CONTRACTS

The realism of personnel compensation rates will be part of the proposal evaluation. Unrealistic rates, as determined by the Contracting Officer, will be considered in the risk assessment and may result in a reduced score.

M.4

EVALUATION CRITERIA AND THE BASIS FOR AWARD

(1) The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represent the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors in the solicitation. The offeror's proposal shall be in the form prescribed by, and shall contain a response to each of the areas identified in the Section L solicitation provisions. The initial evaluation prior to the competitive range determination will be as follows: Factors 1, 2, and 3 when combined are significantly more important than factor 4 and factor 1 is more important than factors 2 - 4. After the completion of factor 5 (Presentation and Demonstration session), factors 1-3 and 5 when combined are significantly more important than factor 4. Factor 6 will only apply to the vendor whose proposal has been selected as providing the best value to the OCC. (2) The technical evaluation factors for the initial evaluation prior to competitive range determination are listed below in descending order:
Factor 1 - Technical Approach Factor 2 - Price Factor 3 - Management Approach Factor 4 - Past Performance

(3) The technical evaluation factors after the establishment of the competitive range are listed below in descending order of importance:
Factor 1 - Technical Approach Factor 2 ­ Price Factor 3 - Management Approach Factor 4 - Past Performance Factor 5 - Demonstration/Presentation

(4) The technical evaluation factor that will be applied to the selected offeror:
Factor 6 - Security

Evaluation of Proposals The Government shall evaluate the Offerors' Technical Capability using five qualitative rating definitions (Exceptional, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, or Unsatisfactory). Proposal risk shall also be assessed for the Security portion of the proposal using three descriptive rating definitions (High, Medium, or Low). The Past Experience/Past Performance portion of the proposal shall be assessed for performance risk using six definitions (very low, low, moderate, high, very high, or unknown). Under Past Performance, performance risk assessments of past performance will help predict how a contractor will perform based on contract performance on requirements of similar type, size, and complexity. An offeror without any past performance will receive a neutral rating.

65

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND SECURITY PERSONNEL TRACKING SYSTEM ­ CIPS PTS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

Factor 1: Technical Approach The Government will evaluate the suitability and fit of the Offeror's technical approach--including all items as requested in Instructions to Offerors, Technical Approach response--with regard to the OCC environment and stated requirements; how that approach will affect the system, its users, and other involved parties; and the degree to which the approach applies a known, certified, documented, and repeatable process. Factor 2: Pricing / Cost Price will be evaluated, but will not receive an adjectival rating. The Government will evaluate the total price proposed for each performance period (i.e. base and all option years) to determine price reasonableness as it relates to the technical requirements and to assist in the best value determination. The Price Proposal will be evaluated for accuracy, completeness and reasonableness. The individual CLIN prices will also be evaluated to determine whether the prices are reasonable and balanced. The Government reserves the right to reject an offer that contains unbalanced pricing pursuant to FAR 15.404-1 (g) (3). The Offeror's responses will be evaluated for technical adequacy of the response in conjunction with the total price and to determine whether it is fair and reasonable. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's use if the proposed labor categories, rates, and unit prices of hardware in their response. The Government will evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of the labor rates as compared to industry norms such as the GSA Federal Supply Schedule or other government wide acquisition contracts. Factor 3: Management Approach The Government will evaluate the Offeror's ability to effectively and efficiently accomplish, administer, staff and manage the day to day operations--including all items as requested in Instructions to Offerors, Management Approach response-- through the use of resources, processes, techniques and tools to ensure successful completion of all tasks required under the contract. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's approach to managing project organization, performance monitoring and control activities, contract performance, subcontractors and/or teaming arrangements, task order management, and ensuring clear distinct lines of communication and decision-making authority are reflected across the program team. Of note, the Government will evaluate the Offeror's selection of key personnel positions and the relative role of these positions within the program team. The Government will evaluate the Offeror on the availability, accessibility, experience and qualifications of the proposed key personnel relative to the tasks specified in the PWS. The Government will evaluate the expertise and skills of proposed key personnel in successfully managing and delivering the services required under the contract.

66

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND SECURITY PERSONNEL TRACKING SYSTEM ­ CIPS PTS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

Also of note, the Offeror's subcontracting plan will be evaluated pursuant to FAR 52.2199. The quality of the Offeror's overall plan will be evaluated including its goals and methods for achieving those goals. The Government will consider the extent to which the plan expresses definitive goals for RFP CC-09-HQ-R-0055 CIPS PTS commitments to subcontracting with small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, HUBZone and servicedisabled veteran-owned small business concerns. The subcontracting plan must be accepted by the Government prior to award and shall be made part of any resulting contract. Factor 4: Past Performance The Government will evaluate the Offeror's recent and relevant past performance in performing tasks related to the PWS. The Offeror will be evaluated on the quality of its past performance on similar work--including all items as requested in Instructions to Offerors, Past Performance response--including customer satisfaction, cost control, timeliness of performance, and effectiveness at accomplishing stated goals. If the Offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance or does not have any past performance information available, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, and will receive a rating of Neutral. The Government may evaluate the past performance of the Offeror's proposed key subcontractors in the same manner as the prime contractor to the extent warranted. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance in awarding subcontracts for the same or similar products or services to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns.

Factor 5: Presentation/Demonstration The presentation / demonstration factor will not be evaluated until after the competitive range determination. Presentations / demonstrations will be evaluated based on the offerors ability to successfully demonstrate their solution in accordance with OCC scripts. Factor 6: Security Factor 6 will only apply to the offeror whose proposal affords the OCC the greatest value to the OCC. Offerors must complete the attached Security Assessment form. M.5 COMPETITIVE RANGE The CO will establish a competitive range of the most highly rated proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest

67

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AND SECURITY PERSONNEL TRACKING SYSTEM ­ CIPS PTS

CC-09-HQ-R-0055

number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. In establishing the competitive range, the government will select a range of the most highly rated proposals. For purposes of establishing the competitive range, technical merit is more important than cost or price. The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and cost or price promises the greatest value to the government, cost or price and other factors considered. The factors are listed below. ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Factor 1 - Technical Approach Factor 2 ­ Price Factor 3 - Management Approach Factor 4 - Past Performance

DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE. OCC will award a contract to the Offeror of a proposal that is judged, by an integrated assessment of all of the evaluation factors, to be the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make one award or no award, depending upon the quality of the proposal submitted the availability of funds, and the estimated number of tasks. OCC will not, in any case, make award to an Offeror it considers to have substandard capabilities or unreasonable prices. If the offeror's proposal is determined unacceptable in any of the technical evaluation factors and/or subfactors, the proposal may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror. END OF SECTION M
