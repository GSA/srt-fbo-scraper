RATING SCALE

Please use the following ratings to answer the questions.  If you are unable to rate an item because it was not a requirement, never an
issue, or you have no knowledge of the item in question, then you should mark “NA”.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Excellent -      The offeror’s performance was consistently superior.  The contractual
           performance was accomplished with only minor problems for which corrective
           action taken by the contractor was highly effective.

Good -                 The offeror’s performance was better than average, and you would
           willingly do business with the offeror again.  The contractual performance was
           accomplished with minor problems for which corrective actions taken by
           the contractor were effective.

Neutral -        No record exists.

Average -        The offeror’s performance was satisfactory and consideration would take part in
           awarding a contract to the offeror again.  The contractual performance reflects a
           problem for which the contractor has not yet implemented corrective actions.

Poor -                 The offeror’s performance was entirely unsatisfactory and you would not do
           business with the offeror again under any circumstances.  The contractual
           performance being assessed contains problems for which the
           contractor‘s corrective actions appear to be or were ineffective.



NOTE:       For statements indicating “Poor”, please provide a brief explanation
           in the comments section of the survey.

B. LOGISTICS DATABASE APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS



This is a Product Description of Required Information Service Regulations for logistics data services to be provided via Vendor’s on-line server or internet technology format.  These services will be accessed through the DLA Troop Support local area network (LAN); compatibility with the DLA Troop Support LAN is essential.  The logistics data service product shall allow for advanced and flexible querying capabilities and the ability to identify and provide detailed data elements for specific National Stock Numbers (NSN)/National Item Identification Numbers (NIIN) and manufacturers’ part numbers.  Product must be capable of being distributed to multiple users through the DLA Troop Support LAN.  The product must be commercially available “off the shelf” at the time of award.  

 

The system must provide on-line WWW access to the following databases:



• FLIS

• Historical NATO NSN records

• Product Item Description (PID)

• PID Specification

• Standards Drawing references

• The complete Military specification and standards index

• DO43/DO43 X-File

• DO49

• SNUD

• Complete historical Procurement History (including Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine

Corp, Coast

• Guard, DLA Inventory Control Points



Subscription Service Support



 • GSA and local government agencies)

• LIRSH

• DODAAF

• QPL Parts Index

• Navy CRF

• MRIL

• AMDF

• SB700-20

• P2300/P2310/P2330, P2002

• CHAIN

• MIAPL

• NICN/NIIN

• APL/AEL

• Work Unit Code (WUC)

• FAA Parts Manufacturing Authority (PMA)

• United Kingdom NSN

• Canadian MCRL and Procurement History databases

• Visibility to spare parts and forged parts tooling data



Product Functionality Features & Requirements:

The system must have the following features and research capabilities:



1. The FLIS database must be searched by any combination of the following fields:

Manufacturer’s part number (which must be found by specifying ANY portion of the part

number), FSC, NIIN, NSN, Item Name (both approved and unapproved item names),

CAGE Code, Company Name, Source of Supply, Acquisition Advice Code, Item Name

Code, End Item Codes from the Army, Navy and Air Force, Navy COG code, PID

Keyword, PID Spec, and technical characteristics.

2. The FLIS database must reference PID information for any NIINs that report such

information. This is a mandatory requirement since PID data often has technical data,

which is not referenced in the V-segment (technical characteristics) and references

specification, standards and drawing number data.

3. The FLIS database must search obsolete NIINs found in the Section K or E of the FLIS

database and instantly reference the correct replacing NIIN.

4. Company Name searches must allow the user to select multiple CAGE’s that represent

the company name searched (since the user may not know which manufacturer’s facility

pertains to their search.). Selecting only one CAGE from a Company Name pick list will

be considered unacceptable by DLA Troop Support since searching by only one CAGE code would result in multiple searches that would negatively impact research time.

5. Keyword searches must select all the records that match the keyword values. 

6. Applicable fields or a combination of fields must independently search each database.

The AMDF must be searched by any combination of the following search keys: NIIN and

LIN; Procurement Histories must be searched by NIIN, FSC, CAGE Code, DUNS

Number, Source of Supply, Contract Number and Government Fiscal Year. The MIAPL

must be searched by APL/RIC, Nomenclature, Drawing Number, Specification Number,

NIIN, CAGE, Manual Number; DODAAF database must be searched by City, Country,

Agency Name, State, Zip Code or DODAAC Code. The CAGE database must be

searched by any combination of the following search keys: CAGE, Company Name,

City, State, Zip, SIC, Telephone Number.

7. Technical Characteristics must be searched by specifying any search in the FLIS, and

then, narrowing the search by any applicable technical characteristics, regardless of INC

(Item Name Code) or Item Names. Users must be able to research parts by entering one

or more of its technical characteristics. Users must also have the ability to select one or

more answers from a pick list of valid replies. Selecting only one value from the pick list

will be considered unacceptable by DLA Troop Support since this will not fulfill the purpose of

searching by technical characteristics. Users must then be able to cross-reference the

FLIS data for each technical characteristic record retrieved and instantly view all relevant

data to the computer screen.

8. A flexible Batch feature must be available to query each database independently by any

single search key. The FLIS database must also be searched by a Part/CAGE

combination in order to retrieve just those specific FLIS records. Batch data must be

input via keyboard or a file and downloaded to either the printer or a file. Output to a

batch must be available in the following formats: Standard formatted reports, user

customized formatted reports, ASCII reports or user customized ASCII reports. Users

must be able to save their search values entered manually to a file for later use. Batch

values resulting in no hits must be recorded in an error log. Users must not be limited to

the number of batch values searched when entering batch values by file.

9. The batch processing must take place on the server so that the user’s workstation is not

tied up during the batch process.

10. The system must provide an instant, clearly visible cross-reference to additional

databases that have more information regarding the part searched.

11. To accommodate DLA Troop Support users, the system must allow users to search by a NICN (Navy Item Control Number) in the FLIS search screen. If the NICN has been assigned a FLIS record, the system must report back the FLIS record and show the NIIN/NSN cross referenced. 

12. To accommodate DSCP Navy database users, the APL and AEL databases must have the

ability to search by NOMENCLATURE, and HULL #. Nomenclature searches must

search all words (regardless of order) and numeric values. This is a key factor for

accurately researching APLS. Also, the APL and AEL databases must support batch

searching, where users are able to customize their output to a field level. Also, to

accommodate DSCP Navy database users, the service must allow output to the Navy’s

ICAPS and ROMIS software programs. This is needed since output to these programs

saves labor time and ensures accuracy.

13. The National Forging and Tooling Database (NFTD) should provide Federal Supply Code, National Item

Identification Number, Part Number, Forging/DIE Number, Forge Shop and Commercial

and Government Entity Code.

14. The databases must be updated promptly, i.e. within days of receiving the published data

to ensure up-to-date, accurate information.



C. VENDOR CATALOG REQUIREMENTS



1. Industrial & Electronic Parts and Equipment Catalogs & Data Sheets (Manufacturers’

Catalogs) provide the ability to reduce procurement costs and make better buying

decisions by providing multiple sources for industrial & electronic parts and equipment.

This is critical in meeting the DoD wide requirement to implement the use of more

Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and EBS initiatives.

2. Engineers and purchasing agents at DLA Troop Support must be parts catalog mavens, adept at quickly finding the part with the right specifications from the right company at the right price.

Paper-based catalogs make this a difficult and time-consuming task. Different companies

Use different terms, part numbers, and organizational schemes to display their wares.

Therefore, DLA Troop Support requires an on-line information system for viewing manufacturers’ catalogs via the WWW. The system must provide expeditious and flexible search

Capabilities.  Product must be commercially available “off the shelf” at the time of award.  



Product Functionality for Vendor Catalogs:



1. The database must be searched by any combination of the following fields: Keyword,

Part Number (which can include any numeric searches; e.g., part number, referenced

Document number, NIIN, NSN, etc.), Manufacturer Name, (includes old names, alternate

and accessible in this database. 

2. The database must allow searching for manufacturer’s catalogs by any of the following:

Street Address, City, State, Zip/Postal Code, Country, Telephone #, Fax #, SIC Code,

NAICS Code, CAGE Code with a result of the actual vendor’s catalog or data sheet.

3. The results list from any search must produce a single list of results with the ability to

View manufactures information and/or full-text catalogs from that results page.

4. The service must include full-text database to both commercial vendor and GSA

Information. It must contain full-text document pages of supplier catalogs, data sheets,

and related documents, and contains GSA supply schedules, contractor information, and

Related publications. All COTS or government-approved sources for items and

information can be searched, viewed, and printed using the same product and the same

search engine.

5. It must use the Internet, standard Web browsers, and the Adobe Acrobat image viewer to

deliver the data, so no customized software installation or configuration is necessary to

use the product.

6. The user must be able to find manufacturer or distributor information for the item

searched.

7. The user must be able to automatically cross-reference other applicable databases for

more information about the item searched.
