Section 508 (http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=policies)requires that federal agencies electronic and information technology is accessible to people with disabilities. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) (http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=1998Amend) are determined as applicable to this acquisition based on the following technical provisions: To understand the technical standards that apply to each provision, the respondent should refer to http://Section 508.gov at http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=stdsdoc. This GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable Section 508 requirements. NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard. Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for this acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information. The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding to the six technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables correspond to accessibility information about information content deliverables and labor hours, respectively.

Motorola has proprietary rights and is the sole source for the parts and software required to upgrade the radios while maintaining the existing factory warranty valid through 2018. Accordingly, it is most cost effective to preserve the warranty for the life of these radios. This contract will service the service gap needed to fully field those radios. Additional information provided in paragraph II. Award to any other source would result in both a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, as well as result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling CIO requirements.

6. Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable: A Survey, by the Contracting Officer, of the market place was conducted and confirms the assumptions regarding the capability of industry to meet the Government needs. Resellers were contacted and it was determined only a Motorola Service provider could provide the proper license technology for the existing radios.

7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable In reviewing the technical requirements and compatibility constraints of this project, the primary hurdles that limit these efforts to other than full and open competition are derived from the expertise solely possessed by Motorola s the OEM. Motorola owns all of the manufacturing and technology expertise's affiliated with their products and is best suited to ensure compatibility challenges and/or constraints are eliminated. The manufacturing costs associated with implementing cross communication/compatibility for universal radio communications efforts far outweigh any cost or schedule savings that might be recouped via unrestricted full and open competition. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) has established a general preference for multiple awards. Use of the TacCom IDIQs should serve to reduce the overhead associated with multiple acquisitions by offering competitive pricing among multiple awardees. In addition, the DHS TacCom contract is available to multiple agencies providing the Government with buying leverage and encourages vendors to offer the best possible prices due to economies of scale. This factor is especially effective for maintaining better prices and quality. Further, DHS negotiated competitive pricing prior to award of the IDIQs and it is anticipated that the pricing will be favorable. This is a firm fixed price contract. Phone calls were made to certified re-sellers and cooperators who provide the encryption capability. This was done to validate sole proprietary, thus, it is expected that the prices Motorola re-sellers will propose will be found to be fair and reasonable prior to contract award.

8.

Description of the Market Research Conducted:

The Contracting Officer contacted Motorola to confirm that limited source Motorola only resellers can provide the proper DES capability for the portable and mobile Radios. Market research revealed there are Authorized Motorola Re-sellers that can bid off the TacCom vehicle. Therefor a decision was made to compete this requirement among authorized Motorola resellers. Paragraph 7 also indicates additional market research that was conducted.

9.

Any Other Facts Supporting the use of Other Than Full and Open Competition

This justification supports the rationale associated with a specific brand name (Motorola) radio supported equipment that has been determined to be essential to satisfying the Government's requirements that is limited to a single source (the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Authorized Re-sellers) capable of providing the required license. As a result, other companies' similar products cannot be modified to meet the Agencies need relative to radio requirements. The Forest Service LMR Radio Replacement Program has been evolving over the last several decades. With this evolution, it has come to the Forest Services' attention that part of the radio program requirements has, through time, unintentionally been relinquished to the various OEMs that produce radio equipment that has supported differing radio communication needs and 3

advancements. Consequently, the opportunities to convert these radio requirements to a competitive environment have been limited by the product technology ownership by the OEM. However the TacCom will allow for radio manufactures to continue submitting products.

10. A listing of the Sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. The following Certified/Authorized Re-Sellers are as follows: B&C Communications Best Tech Inc. Tribalco Cosner ComTech, Inc. Patriot Wireless

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required In reviewing the technical requirements and compatibility constraints of this project, the primary hurdles that limit these efforts to other than full and open competition are derived from the expertise solely possessed by Motorola as the OEM. Motorola owns all of the manufacturing and technology expertise's affiliated with their products and is best suited to ensure compatibility challenges and/or constraints are eliminated. The manufacturing costs associated with implementing cross communication/compatibility for universal radio communications efforts far outweigh any cost or schedule savings that might be recouped via unrestricted full and open competition.
