The notice shall include the following information (except that the information pertaining to National Labor Relations Board shall not be included in notices posted in the plants or offices of carriers subject to the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 151-188)). Notice to Employees Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs. Under certain conditions, the law permits a union and an employer to enter into a union-security agreement requiring employees to pay uniform periodic dues and initiation fees. However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments. For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number: National Labor Relations Board Division of Information 1099 14th Street, N.W.

(d) In the event that the Contractor does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), or (g), the Secretary may direct that this contract be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and declare the Contractor ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures at 29 CFR part 470, Subpart B--Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations and Enforcement Procedures.

(g) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, entered into in connection with this contract, unless exempted by the Department of Labor Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Programs on account of special circumstances in the national interest under authority of 29 CFR 470.3(c). For indefinite quantity subcontracts, the Contractor shall include the substance of this clause if the value of orders in any calendar year of the subcontract is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Pursuant to 29 CFR part 470, Subpart B--Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations and Enforcement Procedures, the Secretary of Labor may direct the Contractor to take such action in the enforcement of these regulations, including the imposition of sanctions for noncompliance with respect to any such subcontract or purchase order. If the Contractor becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor or vendor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a result of such direction, the Contractor may request the United States, through the Secretary of Labor, to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.

As used in this provision-"Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.

"Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award.

(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. (1) The proposal submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade secrets; business data, e.g., commercial information, financial information, and cost and pricing data; and technical data) which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following statements, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be restricted: Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services, data contained in the portions of this proposal which have been specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. by the offeror as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes. The offeror acknowledges that the Department may not be able to withhold a record (data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the Department's FOI officials must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if the Department has determined that disclosure is required by the Act. If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act. The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act. The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages ( insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other identification). (2) In addition, the offeror must mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following statement: "Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation." (3) Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive statements or statements differing in substance from those cited above may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with a nonconforming statement(s). (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be - 36 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-RR-PB-2009-84-LMB

necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques.

15. Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility, HHSAR 352.270-19(a) (January 2008) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794D), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Provisions (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit: 1. Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and 2. Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotations/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility provisions. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm. The Section 508 standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/ Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://508.hhs.gov. Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products and/or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section - 44 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-RR-PB-2009-84-LMB

508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products and/or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government - i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products and/or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expenses.

Proposals will be technically evaluated in accordance with SECTION M - Evaluation Factors for Award of this solicitation. 4. Obtaining and Disseminating Biomedical Research Resources As a public sponsor of biomedical research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a dual interest in accelerating scientific discovery and facilitating product development. Intellectual property restrictions can stifle the broad dissemination of new discoveries and limit future avenues of research and product development. At the same time, reasonable restrictions on the dissemination of research tools are sometimes necessary to protect legitimate proprietary interests and to preserve incentives for commercial development. To assist NIH contractors achieve an appropriate balance, the NIH has provided guidance in the form of a two-part document, consisting of Principles setting forth the fundamental concepts and Guidelines that provide specific information to patent and license professionals and sponsored research administrators for implementation. The purpose of these Principles and Guidelines is to assist NIH funding recipients in determining: 1) Reasonable terms and conditions for making NIH-funded research resources available to scientists in other institutions in the public and private sectors (disseminating research tools); and 2) Restrictions to accept as a condition of receiving access to research tools for use in NIH-funded research (acquiring research tools). The intent is to help recipients ensure that the conditions they impose and accept on the transfer of research tools will facilitate further biomedical research, consistent with the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act and NIH funding policy. This policy, entitled, "Sharing Biomedical Research Resources: Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Research Grants and Contracts," (Federal Register Notice, December 23, 1999 [64 FR 72090] will be included in any contract awarded from this solicitation. It can be found at the following website: http://ott.od.nih.gov/NewPages/64FR72090.pdf 5. Information Security is applicable to this solicitation and the following information is provided to assist in proposal preparation. IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS: The following information shall be addressed in a separate section of the Technical Proposal entitled, "INFORMATION SECURITY." The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347) (FISMA) requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to safeguard information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor (including subcontractor), or other source. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued a number of publications that provide guidance in the establishment of minimum security controls for management, operational and technical safeguards needed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a Federal information system and its information. The Statement of Work (SOW) requires the successful offeror to (1) develop, (2) have the ability to access, or (3) host and/or maintain a Federal information system(s). Pursuant to Federal and HHS Information Security Program Policies the following requirements apply to this solicitation: Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), Title III, E-Government Act of 2002, Pub.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
1. GENERAL Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors. The factors in order of importance are: technical, cost/price, and past performance. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, past performance, and cost/price are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price. The trade-off process described in FAR 15.101-1 will be employed. This process permits trade-offs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced or highest technically rated offeror. In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFP. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFP. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below. 2. MANDATORY QUALIFICATION CRITERIA Listed below are mandatory qualification criteria. THE OFFEROR SHALL INCLUDE ALL INFORMATION WHICH DOCUMENTS AND/OR SUPPORTS THE QUALIFICATION CRITERIA IN ONE CLEARLY MARKED SECTION OF ITS PROPOSAL. The qualification criteria establishes conditions that must be met at the time of receipt of Proposals by the Contracting Officer in order for your proposal to be considered any further for award. 1. The offeror must have achieved a CMMi Level-3 certification by an independent SCAMPI auditor in the past 3 years. 2. The offeror must have at least 3 years experience related to biomedical grant management information systems.

3. EVALUATION OF OPTIONS It is anticipated that any contract(s) awarded from this solicitation will contain option provision(s) and period(s). In accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options, (July 1990), the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement, except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 4. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA The evaluation criteria are used by the technical evaluation committee when reviewing the technical proposals. The criteria below are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes. See Section J., Attachment 10

5. PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR - 59 -

RFP Number : NHLBI-RR-PB-2009-84-LMB

Offeror's past performance information will be evaluated subsequent to the technical evaluation. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable. The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.

Project Description and Statement of Work

Project Description
NCRR Information Technology Environment Hardware: The present environment includes multi processor blade servers hosting development, test, and production environments for various NCRR applications. These servers are located off site. This task does not include management of server resources. The user community uses wired and wireless desktop, laptop (and laptop docking stations), tablet PCs, and BlackBerrys. Various printers, plotters, scanners, and CDRW recorders are also used. Software: The present environment includes: Sharepoint portal, Microsoft Sharepoint Server (MOSS) 2007, Exchange 2007, Oracle, MS 2003 OS, SQL Server 2005, MS IIS, Visual Basic, Adobe Acrobat, Apache, Unix, and Rational Concert, and Business Objects. Desktop clients have Alteris patch management, MS XP OS, and Office 2007 and various client side applications that access mission critical systems. The public accesses NCRR systems using Pentium and Macintosh systems. The majority of users use Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari to access NCRR web-based applications. This environment will change as new technologies are evaluated and incorporated into the architecture. Network: The present environment includes CISCO routers and switches, CAT 5 cabling, and CISCO VPN. In addition, NCRR uses video teleconferencing (VTC) technologies and Blackberry mobile devices. Network maintenance and network administration are outsourced to the NIH Center for Information Technology (CIT) and will not be part of the NCRR Technical Support task. NCRR IT Governance: NCRR information technology oversight includes an Information Technology Investment Review Board that performs information technology portfolio governance. In this capacity, the board reviews investment business cases, project schedules, variances, and costs. Project committees are established to gather and prioritize requirements, perform government acceptance testing, and provide overall project guidance. Once a system is deployed, a change control board is established to define new requirements or changes to existing system requirements, identify and develop business policies that support IT changes, and prioritize and approve system changes at a designated cost threshold. Objectives Continue the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of the NCRR Scientific Information System, Construction Grants Management System, Electronic Financial Management System, Internet, Intranet, Grant Workflow Information System, Web 2.0 collaborative technologies, Geospatial, and other systems to be determined. Create a software development environment where the process is structured, documented, and repeatable, resulting in a quality product. Provide Tier 2 and 3 helpdesk services that are consistent, responsive, and superior.

List of Existing Systems Maintained and Supported

The following is a list of existing systems that OIT maintains and supports:
Scientific Information System (SIS) A strategic objective of the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) is to provide clinical and translational researchers with the training and tools they need to understand, detect, treat, and prevent a wide range of diseases. In order to do this, research applications are reviewed, awarded, monitored and data reported. In NCRR, monitoring and reporting for center grants is done via progress reports submitted annually by the grantee, describing their scientific efforts and advancements for the year. The Scientific Information System (SIS) initiative facilitates this reporting by streamlining grantee submission of data and providing mechanisms for automatic coding and transference of science and cost data to enterprise systems for congressional and other reporting. These data are also used by the Office of Science Policy staff throughout the year to generate and to account for science research performed under NCRR funds. Enhancements to this system will provide more accurate and timely data in the enterprise systems while reducing effort on grantee and NCRR staff for submission and review. The NCRR SIS is a web-based system used for tracking NCRR grants, contracts, interagency agreements, etc., and accepting grantee annual progress reports. This system provides functionality for automatic scientific coding, search tools, ability for manipulating keyword and category searches, subproject cost calculations, standardized and customized reports and the ability to export data to other NIH systems. Annually, SIS exports data for G&M, CRISP, and Nutrition. On the quarterly basis, SIS export data to ARIS. All data shared with downstream with NIH systems are conducted through destination system protocols (transaction file, API calls, Web Services, etc.). Grant data is imported from the IMPAC II system on a nightly basis via Oracle scripts. A subset of data is used to generate data for the electronic Funds Management System (eFMS) for all grants in the process of funding (awarded, commitments, intend-to-pay, etc.). Contract and Interagency Agreements (IAA) data are added by the Office of Financial Management (OFM) or Grants Management (GM). Center grantees submit their annual progress reports via web environments or XML that have been tailored for each NCRR Division. These are reviewed throughout the year by the NIH Health Scientist Administrators (HSAs) to identify problems and are rolled to the internal environment for OSP review and coding. Within the Clinical Research Division, grantees can submit reports in .MDB, .XML and .PDF format, which are all zipped up before sending. SIS provides the `ARP2XML' program to allow them output .ZIP files which are to uploaded to SIS system. The program checks their integrity and outputs an .MDB file. It also converts .MDB into .XML format; if any errors, it generates the error file. XML files are also supported for the Biomedical Technology Resources (BT) Division. For the web-based entry, a series of screens are available for direct entry of data or a copy/cut and paste entry of data. For the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA), grantees must use XML and PDFs to submit their data. A template of the XML schema is available upon request. At the end of each fiscal year, Office of Information Technologies (OIT) staff use the science data coded by OSP to allocate grant dollars across the subprojects. This is done in two (2) fashions ­ by patient days and percentages. After costs are allocated and validated, OIT transfers data to the NIH enterprise systems and OSP searches and reports scientific topic budgets to fulfill requests by Congress and other private organizations.
Page 1 of 4

List of Existing Systems Maintained and Supported
Users are restricted in their ability to view and edit science data based on their roles: OSP ­ review and modify all science files until files frozen by OIT at the end of the fiscal year (FY); post-FY searching data for reporting purposes. OIT/contractor ­ develop, review, and modify features as requested by OSP. OFM/GM ­ modify commitment dollars; add contracts and IAA data. OIT (selected) ­ review and modify all cost and science data. HSA ­ read only access to grantee submitted annual progress report data. Division Program Analyst ­ review and modify data submitted by the grantee Grantees ­ full access to their own current grant, post-submittal read only access to the data they submitted. The base SIS system has been operational since July 2001. More functions, features, and reports have been added each subsequent year. There are three internal areas (Grant Log, Cost Control, and Reports) and two external areas handling the APRs for the following areas: Biomedical Technology Resources (BTR) Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Clinical Resources Center (CRC) Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) Research Centers in Minority Institutions (RCMI) National Primate Research Centers (NPRC). Other development, additions, and updates are in progress (i.e., new features, software upgrades, 508 compliance, machine maintenance, etc.) Electronic Financial Management System (eFMS) The system is a web-enabled fiscal planning tool of the current fiscal year for the Office of Financial Management (OFM) and NCRR managers. It provides the Budget Officer with a means to ensure appropriate fiscal control, monitor obligations to verify compliance, and provide accurate, current information to NCRR management for the NCRR extramural portfolio. Both dynamic data from IMPAC II and local non-enterprise data are available. Grant data are displayed in a variety of formats, including web pages, web summary tables, Excel spreadsheets and formal reports. There are ten (10) distinct modules, each with a unique purpose: Allowances, Grant Pay Selection, Operating Plans, Contracts...., Query Data, Reports, Type 2 Placeholders, OGM Updates, Administrative Supplements, Out year budgets. In these, the eFMS manages the NCRR application funding approval process for the competitive applications and administrative/co-funding supplements, sends email notifications to the next approval level, provides analytic tools for budgetary planning, transmits data via Web Interface, maintains history and accounting, collects submitted data, and transmits to IMPAC II final approval and budgetary levels on demand. Inputs to the eFMS include data from the prepared IMPAC II data stored in the Scientific Information System (SIS), as well as input from users. The eFMS pushes live updates by OGM, OFM to SIS and
Page 2 of 4

List of Existing Systems Maintained and Supported
displays Reports from SIS. It also executes Application Program Interfaces (APIs) to export data to the NIH Enterprise IMPAC II system. Read access is granted to all NCRR staff but only staff with authorization and specific roles have the ability to take actions. The eFMS has been in its operational phase of its life cycle since March, 2006 with additional modules implemented since then. Other development and modifications are in progress, including interfacing with Documentum workflows in the Grants Workflow Information System (GWIS). Construction Grants Management System (CGMS) The system is a web-enabled Construction Grants Management tool for the NCRR staff. The CGMS is used to track C06 Construction grants. The system has separate data entry with reports and audit log. The CGMS features include Alerts/Notifications, quick jumps, IMPAC II nightly updates and uploading of Division of Research Infrastructure (DRI) and Office of Grant Management (OGM) data. Access to the CGMS is role-based with four user types: Administrators who can edit and delete the grants. Grant Management and Program Management ­ OGM and DRI can edit specific fields of the grants. Viewer can Read and View the grants only. Inputs to the CGMS include from the prepared IMPAC II data of Scientific Information System (SIS), from the Notification Process, and from Web pages. Once processed through the CGMS system, the outputs can be displayed via the NCRR Intranet CGMS Web site. The CGMS also updates Web pages and displays Reports. CGMS connects directly to IMPAC II for nightly data refresh. All downloads and data shared with NIH systems are conducted through destination system on demand protocols (i.e., API calls). CGMS was implemented in production since October 2006. Current enhancements include opening its usage to a restricted set of NIH users who also must track their constructions grants. Grants Workflow Information Management System (GWIS) The contract shall implement a NCRR document management system to manage information related to administration of NCRR awarded grants. Working with document management project teams, the contractor will document, using UML methodologies, requirements, document management roles, analyze document usage, plan the organization of documents and meta data, plan on how documents and content moves between process points, plan content control through information rights management, and document policies during requirement discussions and make them available as context sensitive help. The contractor will minimize customized coding to the greatest extent possible and utilize "out-of-the-box" work. The NCRR methods for maintaining documentation and processing grant actions vary across its Divisions and Offices. The Grants Workflow Information System (GWIS) is intended to standardize processes and document handling. GWIS is a Mission Supportive Application System. It is being developed through a structured approach. Ideas are elicited from various organizational levels and subject areas. A series of graphical depictions are provided as discussion starters on workflows and processes. The development and deployment of GWIS will be iterative in nature, allowing for prioritized process availability to NCRR population. GWIS provides web-based and Microsoft Outlook integration to help NCRR personnel automate and improve the grant management processes/workflows. In addition, GWIS includes curation tools to prevent inaccurate data from being introduced via enterprise IMPAC system, provides audit reports, grant folders to save related grant documents with ability to nominate documents for inclusion in
Page 3 of 4

List of Existing Systems Maintained and Supported
the official Grant Folder, and augment functionality of the electronics Funds Management System (eFMS). GWIS users access the system via the Web and from their Microsoft Outlook interface. The following modules are being developed and delivered iteratively. 1. The Documentum module includes the Documentum configuration and customization using the EMC Documentum software. It consists of 4 sub modules of Custom Documentum Objects, Forms, Workflows, and Outlook Client. 2. The Grant Detail Module customizes screens to display grant detail information by pulling data directly from IMPAC II Data Mart. They will be integrated into Documentum WebTop using Documentum Web Development Kit (WDK) to provide seamless look-and-feel. 3. Documentum Jobs Modules are chronologic (chron) jobs running frequently to look for new or updated grant information in the enterprise system and create or update the GWIS Folder information accordingly. 4. GWIS Information Interface (GII) Module is the central communication between Documentum applications, underlying databases, GII tools and external systems. The currently defined Interfaces are: JDBC or SQL function to interact with underlying databases Web services/APIs to communicate with external entity (e.g. transfer/put documents from workflows to IMPAC II Grant Folders) Application Interface to update workflow status to eFMS 5. Curation Module includes the development of the data curation and GII tools. The curator uses these tools to vet data changes for correctness and identify inaccuracies in IMPAC as defined by GWIS. They provide notification of new or updated GWIS folder creation, provide audit reports, and features to archive or delete GWIS folders. GWIS accepts users' emails and documentation via the EMC Documentum interface. Workflows have been identified and are being developed to process Unsolicited Administrative Supplements, Carry-Over Requests, Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs)/ Program Announcements, Annual Progress Report Approvals, National Advisory Research Resources Council (NARRC) Processes, New and Competing Continuation Awards, and Competitive Administrative Supplements. Further NCRR processes are being evaluated for inclusion in GWIS. Intranet and Internet Content Maintenance System Support The NCRR Internet provides a critical communication medium for disseminating scientific program information and collaborating with NCRR stakeholders. Intranet and portal technologies assist NCRR staff in developing, storing, and disseminating information used in the development and oversight of NCRR scientific programs. The contractor shall continue the design, development and maintenance of a Content Management System (CMS) using Share Point and Microsoft .NET development frameworks. The purpose of the CMS will be to allow NCRR's non-technical users the ability to maintain content on their web sites and to provide collaboration opportunities with NCRR stakeholders. The contractor shall develop system components using C# and ASP.NET. The contractor will be responsible for providing documentation on lifecycle phases.

Stage Gate Convergence with Governance Processes Action or Process Update Deliverable Baseline/Re-baseline/Archive Deliverable

Using the Icons
The picture icons at left are provided throughout the guide to help distinguish deliverables and stage gate signoff processes. They also reveal the convergence of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) with other DOC processes including governance processes and the project management methodology.

This guide is also designed to help contractors comply with NCRR policy and execute widelyaccepted industry best practices in the development and delivery of NCRR IT projects. All of these tools are designed to help achieve success in development and deployment of software and related components to satisfy project requirements. After reviewing this guide and by using it to develop and deploy software and related components, you should be able to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Understand the activities and tasks within the System Development Life Cycle Understand the purpose of and the relationships between each of the NCRR IT SDLC processes Understand how the NCRR IT SDLC process converges with the various NCRR IT governance processes Identify the deliverables and stage gates required for compliance with NCRR policy and standards.

2. CONVERGENCE WITH GOVERNANCE PROCESSES

Within NCRR, a number of governance processes guide the development, implementation, and management of the Center's IT resources. The approval and chartering of an IT project requires conformance with the Enterprize Performance Lifecycle Process (EPLC), the first governance process which serves as a stage gate into the SDLC process. Prior to issuance of a charter, the project must also demonstrate adherence to NIH's Enterprise Architecture (EA) Business Reference.

1

Model (BRM), Once projects are chartered, SDLC convergence with governance processes continues to ensure that architecture, infrastructure, and operational standards are aligned with NCRR's strategic IT planning process. The System Development Life Cycle converges with these governance processes in the Design and Deployment phases. More specifically, review of the System Design Description document is a key milestone in the EPLC stage gate process and formalized Certification and Accreditation is a requirement for the Approval to Deploy stage gate. Convergence of the SDLC tasks with the various governance processes is indicated in this guide by the  icon in the Convergence column of each Activity Task table.

In addition to convergence with the NCRR IT governance processes, the SDLC must be closely integrated with the project management methodology. Project managers are ultimately responsible for the success of a project and will use the inputs, processes, outputs, and documentation from the SDLC to ensure that success.

3. SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE ACTIVITIES
The following sections provide details on each SDLC activity; a description of the purpose of the activity, entry and exit criteria, and the sequence of tasks to be completed or initiated within each activity. Various SDLC methodologies have been developed over the years to guide the processes involved, including the waterfall model (which was the original SDLC method), rapid application development (RAD), joint application development (JAD), the iterative development model, the spiral model, and others. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) developmental processes align themselves closely, but not exclusively, to iterative development methodologies. At a very high level, the Requirements, Design, Coding, and Testing phases would each be a part, in varying degrees, of an iteration. In the example below, Iteration #1 would include requirements gathering, design work, and perhaps some testing of the Business Process Models developed. Iteration #2 would include more of the above but also include some coding based on the requirements and design work already done.

It is important to note that although this guide is laid out in a linear and sequential format it does not advocate the exclusive use of a waterfall development model. For clarity, the text for each stage may be written as though the stage is done once with a single entry and exit point; however, as seen in the figure above, additional iterations of stages are likely. The documents discussed below make up the necessary artifacts for NCRR IT Projects.

3.1 DOCUMENT SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
Purpose: To establish a common understanding of the requirements between the customer, stakeholders, and the project team. System requirements are elicited from the customer and other stakeholders, analyzed, and presented in a Systems Requirements Specification (SRS). The SRS is used as the basis for the design and implementation of the system. It is imperative that the SRS be verified with the customer and stakeholders to ensure that the system requirements are correct and complete and that they are accurately represented within the Project Concept Proposal, Project Business Case, Project Charter, and Project Plan.

Acceptance testing

Definition
Determination of the correctness of all functionality of the system in order to provide the basis for acceptance of the system. The act of examining a complex whole by dividing it into its parts or elements. To analyze suggests separating or distinguishing the component parts of something (as a substance, a process, a situation) so as to discover its true nature or inner relationships. A work product that has been formally reviewed and accepted by the involved parties. A baseline should be changed only through formal configuration management procedures. Some baselines may be project deliverables while others provide the basis for further work. The Business Reference Model is a function-driven framework for describing the business operations of the Department. The BRM is the first layer of the Department's Enterprise Architecture and it is the main viewpoint for the analysis of data, service components and technology. A set of procedures and judgments leading to a determination of the suitability, from an information assurance standpoint, of an information technology system to operate in an operational environment. The extent to which an item under test satisfies specifications and fulfills user's mission objectives. Any measurable, tangible, verifiable outcome, result, or item that must be produced to complete a project or part of a project. Often used more narrowly in reference to an external deliverable; that is, a deliverable that is subject to approval by the project sponsor or customer. To place into appropriate position or arrange strategically.

Definition
The Data Reference Model is a framework to promote the common identification, use, and appropriate sharing of data/information across systems and NIH Department. It provides standards and guidelines to help operating units structure, categorize, exchange, and manage their data to improve the Department's ability to perform Department-wide information sharing. The practice of applying a comprehensive and rigorous method for describing a current or future structure for an organization's processes, information systems, personnel and organizational sub-units, so that they align with the organization's core goals and strategic direction. The determination of the correctness of the aggregate with regard to its associated requirements. The PRM is a "reference model" or standardized framework to measure the performance of major IT investments and their contribution to program performance. A collection of generally sequential project phases whose names and number are determined by the control needs of the organization or organizations involved in the project. A life cycle can be documented with a methodology. The Service Component Reference Model (SRM) is a business and performance-driven, functional framework that classifies Service Components with respect to how they support business and/or performance objectives. A conceptual model used in project management that describes the stages involved in an information system development project. The stages include an initial feasibility study, planning, resource allocation and risk assessment through requirements gathering, design, implementation, integration, testing, deployment, maintenance; and finally retirement of the completed application. These phases may overlap or be performed iteratively. The determination of the correctness of the system and verification that the system conforms to stated requirements. The Technical Reference model is used to describe and align the technical standards, specifications, and technology capabilities supporting the delivery, exchange, and construction of business (or service) components. The TRM provides a foundation to advance the re-use of technology and component services from a Department-wide perspective. 22

Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
Objective: The purpose of this plan is to provide a quality surveillance plan for the maintenance and enhancements to NCRR information systems. This plan provides a basis for the Project Officer/Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) to evaluate the quality of the Contractor's performance. The oversight provided for in the contract and in this plan will help to ensure that service levels reach and maintain the required levels throughout the contract term. Further, this plan provides the Project Officer/COTR with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance, and provides verifiable input for the required annual past performance evaluations. Performance Standards: A. Quality Level: By monitoring the Contractor, the Project Officer/COTR will determine whether the performance levels set forth in the contract have been attained. B. Frequency: During the performance of this contract, the Project Officer/COTR will take periodic measurements (i.e. conduct surveillance), as specified, and will analyze whether the negotiated frequency of measurement is appropriate for the work being performed. Adjustments may only be made by a modification to the contract. C. Management Responsiveness: The Project Officer/COTR will determine whether the Contractor has managed the contract effectively and efficiently, as specified in the quality standards set forth below. The Project Officer/COTR will confirm whether the Contractor has satisfactorily met all reporting requirements, including subcontracting reports when applicable. Evaluation Methods: The Project Officer/COTR will conduct performance evaluations based upon the below required performance levels set forth in the contract. The following techniques will be used to perform surveillance: A. System Performance Report. The Project Officer/COTR will review performance records of the Information systems as captured in the Rational SDLC management tool to ensure that the required CMMI documents have been provided. Omissions shall be noted. Results shall be shared with the contracting officer. B. Service Level Monitoring. The Contractor is required to resolve product malfunctions and failures quickly. Customer feedback will be sought and the Rational SDLC management tool shall be reviewed to ensure that reported problems are resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible. Desired Outcomes A well managed task order with appropriate monitoring of progress, costs, schedule, quality assurance, configuration management and security management. Performance Standard Monthly status reporting including, project status, task status, issues, programmer productivity, and actions.

Technical Evaluation Criteria/Mandatory Criteria

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA 1. GENERAL
Selection of an Offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against three factors. The factors in order of importance are: Technical, Cost/Price, and Past Performance. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost/price and past performance are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost/price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. The trade-off process described in FAR 15.101-1 will be employed. This process permits tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced or highest technically rated offeror. In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFP. The merits of each proposal will be carefully evaluated. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFP. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below.

2. MANDATORY QUALIFICATION CRITERIA
The Mandatory Qualification Criteria must be met at the time of the original proposal submission as follows: a. The Offeror must have achieved a CMMI Level 3 certification by an independent SCAMPI auditor in the past 3 years. b. The offeror must have at least 3 years experience related to Biomedical Grant Management Information Systems. Failure to provide all the required documentation for the Mandatory Qualification Criteria will result in rejection of the proposal without further consideration. The documentation of the Mandatory Qualification Criteria will be reviewed by the Project Officer prior to the general technical review of the Technical Proposal.

3. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA
The evaluation criteria are used by the technical evaluation committee when reviewing the technical proposals. Proposals will be judged solely on the written material provided by the Offeror. The criteria below are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes.

1

Technical Evaluation Criteria/Mandatory Criteria

Criterion Element 1. Understanding the Requirement and Technical Approach a. Demonstrated understanding of SOW requirements from a management and technical standpoint, including proposal of technical solutions, specific tools and technologies to meet requirements of the SOW. The quality of proposed software/system development lifecycle (SDLC) will be evaluated. In addition, the offeror's approach to CMMI Level 3 implementation, automation, artifact visibility and approach to improving business operations at NCRR through the implementation and maintenance of IT systems. b. The proposal shall present a management plan and a comprehensive Discussion and outline of proposed methodologies to successfully accomplish the tasks and performance standards as outlined. In addition, the contractor shall submit a quality assurance plan that must be established to ensure that the requirements of the contract are provided as specified. This plan must specify the areas to be inspected, methods of identifying deficiencies in the quality of services performed, the corrective actions that need to be taken, and procedures for notifying the Government when deficiencies are encountered. This plan shall also include methods to identify opportunities for process and customer service improvements. 2. Expertise and Experience of Proposed Staff The Offeror's proposed key staff will be evaluated on resumes that describe each individual's: a. b. c. d. e. Proposed labor category and/or role; Suitability for proposed position, function, or role; Education; Specific experience related to the proposed position; and Specific experience on projects of similar size, scope, complexity and functionality.

Weight 40

20

Note: The technical proposal must provide verifiable documentation of Specific experience for each proposed staff person. Simply claiming Expertise for the proposed staff is not acceptable. Evidence of the staff members' expertise, where it was applied, and length of experience must be provided.

2

Technical Evaluation Criteria/Mandatory Criteria

3.

Corporate Capabilities and Experience Corporate capabilities will be evaluated based on the following: a. The Offeror's description and discussion of the corporation and any proposed subcontractors, the roles, services, and/or products proposed to be supplied by each corporate team member. b. The Offeror's description and discussion of additional applicable information demonstrating corporate resources and capabilities to perform the tasks contained in the SOW. c. Training plan and skill set retention plan d. The contractor shall propose and discuss a change management process that shall include configuration management of all application documentation as the application is modified and updated. Please indicate length of time proposed methods and technologies have been used. (e.g. CMMI certification)

20

4.

Cost The prices offered in each proposal shall be totaled and compared. Points shall be awarded according to the following formula: Lowest Price Offeror's Price

20

x

# available points (20) = Cost Points Assigned

A cost realism analysis will be performed to determine reasonableness of costs. It is noted that points are merely a guide for source selection and the mathematical outcome is not necessarily determinative of the successful offeror. TOTAL POSSIBLE POINTS 100

4. PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR
An evaluation of the Offeror's past performance information will be conducted subsequent to the technical evaluation. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any Offeror whose proposal would not be selected for award based on the results of the evaluation of factors other than past performance. The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the Offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each Offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that Offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an Offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.
3

Technical Evaluation Criteria/Mandatory Criteria

When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the Offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the Offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the Offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the Offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror's business -like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the Offeror's performance. The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the Offeror.
