SECTION C – DESCRIPTIONS/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENTS



The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) enterprise requires an unlimited term license over a Base-Year and two One-Year Option Periods for decision support software that follows an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method, performing group evaluations, utilizing Pairwise Comparisons and Sensitivity Analysis. The software must be compatible with client-based with industry standard hand-held numerical voting devices.    



AHP is defined as a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions.  Rather than prescribing a “correct” decision, the AHP helps decision makers find one that best suits their goal and their understanding of the problem.  It provides a comprehensive and rational framework for structuring a decision problem, for representing and quantifying its elements, for relating those elements to overall goals, and for evaluating alternative solutions. 



This AHP type of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method is defined as a sub-discipline of operations research that explicitly considers multiple criteria in decision-making environments.  Structuring complex problems well and considering multiple criteria, explicitly lead to more informed and better decisions.  The MCDA method will perform utilizing group evaluation defined as each member of the decision making body is able to make their subjective opinions known by entering numerical values (votes) to a question with multiple answers.  The tool then aggregates the opinions (votes) and applies an algorithm to show the group their collective opinion.  



The group evaluation is performed using either a PairWise Comparison or Sensitivity Analysis. The software is required to conduct pairwise comparisons independently of sensitivity analysis.  It is an either/or scenario.  The Pairwise Comparison generally refers to any process of comparing entities in pairs to judge which of each entity is preferred or has the greater amount of some quantitative property.  The method of pairwise comparison is used in the scientific study of preferences, attitudes, voting systems, social choice, public choice, and multi-agent Artificial Intelligence systems. 



 The Sensitivity Analysis (SA) is the study of how the variation (uncertainty) in the output of a statistical model can be attributed to different variations in the inputs of the model.  Put another way, it is a technique for systematically changing variables in a model to determine the effects of such changes.  In any budgeting process there are always variables that are uncertain.  Future tax rates, interest rates, inflation rates, headcount, operating expenses and other variables may not be known with great precision.  Sensitivity analysis answer the question, “if these variables deviate from expectations, what will the effect be (on the business, model, system, or whatever is being analyzed)?”  In more general terms uncertainty and sensitivity analysis investigate the robustness of a study when the study includes some form of statistical modeling.



The software must be compatible with client-based with industry standard hand-held numerical voting devices.  Client version software should be capable of being installed on a workstation and can be run from a conference room completely independent of external IT hardware from the conference room.  Hand-held voting device allows people with decision authority that have been invited to the decision meeting to tally their “votes” across a numerical continuum (1-5).  The software, in the background, aggregate the votes and displays graphically the group’s responses.  



The tool must be able to evaluate risk based on numeric scores provided by the decision makers.
