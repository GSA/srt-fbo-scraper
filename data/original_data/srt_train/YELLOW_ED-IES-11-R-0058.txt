2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 PROCEEDINGS MS. JOHNSON: Good afternoon. How's everybody doing? Wonderful. Welcome to the United States Department of Education's Pre-solicitation Conference for the highly anticipated procurement within the Institute of Education Sciences National Center for Education Statistics titled, the Education Statistics Support Institute Network Contract; also known as the "network" or by the acronym ESSIN. My name is Deila Johnson. I am the contracting officer for this procurement. The purpose of today's conference is to disseminate information to potential offerors about this requirement. We encourage you to communicate your comments, questions, and concerns. At this time, I'd like to introduce the Department of Education staff on our panel today. I'd just ask you all to wave your hand or stand so attendees know who you are. To my left is Natasha Boyce. She is the contract specialist. Alean Miller, the contracting officer's representative. Marilyn Seastrom, the acting deputy commissioner of the National Center for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 to provide questions, comments, or concerns by last Thursday. So those are the ones that, you know, we will first go through. So, hopefully, it'll answer a lot of the questions that you probably came here with today. If you have any questions, we ask that you write them down on note cards and provide them to me and Natasha at the end of the presentation. You will also be able to comment or ask questions at the microphone during this period. Some of your comments, questions, and concerns -- the responses to those may be provided today, and others may not. It just depends on the complexity. Some things we may be able to address today, other things we have to go back -research due to the nature of it. And just for you all to be aware, this pre-solicitation conference is being recorded, and a verbatim transcripts -- transcript of this conference, which will include all questions and answers, will be released with the solicitation in June on www.fbo.gov. We ask that you put all cell phones and electronic devices on vibrate at this time. There are 4

3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Education Statistics. And that's also known as NCES; that's the acronym. From the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, the small business representatives are Marcella Coverson and Melanie Carter. Helen Chang -- where are you Helen -- right there. Helen Chang is the small business liaison between the contracts' office in the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization. And is Sherese Lewis here? Okay. She's not in here. Now did everyone receive an agenda whenever you came in? And did you also receive any note cards or anything to write down questions on? Okay. If not -- if you need it, raise your hands because I would advise you to jot down questions as you go so if you have questions later on you remember what they are. The agenda will proceed as listed. We ask that you hold all questions and answers to the particular period on the agenda. Please note then during the Q&A questioning period, we will provide responses to questions received by last Thursday's deadline posted on www.fbo.gov under the pre-solicitation notice. So many of you all know that you were required to RSVP and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 bathrooms and water fountains located on this floor. And just locate your nearest Department of Education staff, and we can direct you to those. So without further delay, I introduce to you Alean Miller. MS. MILLER: Good afternoon. I would like to begin my comments by encouraging you to go to the NCES website at nces.ed.gov. Spend some time familiarizing yourself with our publications and products, surveys and programs, the annual reports, data tubes, fast facts, and other products listed on the site. Many of the products and services described on the website are supported by work that is described in the ESSIN solicitation. Throughout the presentation and hereafter, we may refer to the contract or the solicitation of the Education Statistics Support Institute Network as the ESSIN or the "network." They are one in the same. The comments made today highlight certain sections of the solicitation and are the work of NCES. These comments, by no means, are to be considered more important than sections that may not be highlighted. All of the information provided in my comments, and those of

6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Deputy Commissioner Seastrom's, can be found in the solicitation. You are encouraged to review, in detail, the final release of the solicitation for changes and/or additional information that may be incorporated since the original release. The network, formed under this contract, will conduct work solely for NCES. No other group -- no group other than NCES will award task orders under this contract. To meet its responsibilities efficiently, NCES contracts for specialized statistical support. Currently, support is provided through two contracts that end December 31, 2011. The network will replace these statistical support contracts. The period of performance for the network shall be for 60 months, beginning January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016. However, offerors should review each Performance Work Statement, and I may -- we may refer to that as the PWS. It is the Performance Work Statement for specific periods of performance. The government anticipates an optional renewal period for up to 60 months for the period January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2021. Offerors 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 reserves the right to make as few as one award to each contractor over the life of the contract. The network will be formed with the awarding of task orders in the first-round summer competition. I'll repeat that. The network will be formed with the awarding of task orders in the first-round summer competition. At this time, NCES plans on awarding up to 16 task orders to the selected contractors that form the network. The remaining base-year task orders will be competed among the network contractors in Groups A and B, fall 2011. Network contractors will be able to bid competitively for task orders on support tasks, varying in nature and scope, to provide a range of assistance and expert advice to support NCES's national and international data collections and assessments, analyses, methodological research, statistical product preparation, and training programs. Group A is open to large and small business contractors, which will both include individual contractors and/or contracting teams. Group B will consist only of contractors identified as small 8

7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 awarded contracts must be fully staffed and ready to begin work on January 1, 2012. This includes ensuring that all personnel assigned to these efforts are fully qualified and do not require additional training to meet performance requirements. The government anticipates awarding new tasks annually and perhaps more frequently throughout the contract period. Task awards may be for any duration up to two years, subject to availability of funds, but are expected to be of one-year duration for the most part. The Performance Work Statement will be awarded for an initial base period during the first year of the contract, with annual options for years two through five, if exercised. The network -- and this -- now going into the structure of the network. The network will be comprised of large and small businesses that fall under two groups: Group A and Group B. The nature and scope of the work will vary from task order to task order, as will the requirements. Approximately 25 task orders will be issued annually. Multiple awards may be made to contractors in Group A and Group B. The government 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 business contractors. Individual task orders will be offered either as Category A, full and open competition, or Category B, small business set-aside. Contractors winning awards in the first round of the competition will join the network as members of Group A or Group B, based on their status in the Central Contractors Registry -- the CCR. Small business contractors may bid as the prime contractor on individual tasks in either Category A or B. Although contractors in Group A may not bid as the prime contractor on individual tasks in Category B -- the small business set-aside -- they may be bid as subcontractors for up to 49% of any Category B task. Conversely, a category in group -- a contractor in Group B may be bid as a subcontractor on work in Category A. Bidding as the prime contractor or being bid as a subcontractor on an individual task in one category does not preclude participation in a bid in the other category on a different task. Teaming. The government seeks competition in the responses to the individual Performance Work Statement. However, offerors may join together and

10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 submit a combined response to an individual performance work statement. Offerors are encouraged to read "Section VII. Nature of Contractors," item 2, "Teamings or Subcontracting" in the solicitation. There will be instances in which a single contracting group does not possess the total expertise necessary to easily respond to all of the anticipated requests for task work -- a subtask work within a task. Therefore, proposed efforts by a contractor to team subcontract will be viewed as a positive response to addressing the work needs, where appropriate. Subcontractors and consultants may be added at a later time with the permission of the COR and the contracting officer. Group B offerors, who may want to respond to work in Category B -- the small business set-aside -- may also want to explore the feasibility of joint ventures in order to respond. Offerors interested in learning more about joint ventures may want to contact Helen Chang in the Small Business Office at helen.chang@ed.gov, or by calling 202.245.6173, or you may submit a joint ventures question today during the question period. Helen Chang 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 MS. SEASTROM: Good afternoon. I'm going to present a brief overview of NCES and some of the important elements of working with NCES before I summarize the overarching themes in the 16 individual Performance Work Statements in the current network RFP. The National Center for Education Statistics is a principal statistical agency within the U.S. Department of Education. Of the 13 principal statistical agencies and units in the United States, NCES ranks 3rd in terms of budget and 10th in terms of size of staff. In 2010, each NCES employee supported approximately $3.2 million in budget. By comparison, the next largest number of dollars per staff is $1.2 million at the Bureau of Justice Statistics. As a result of this balance of dollars to staff, much of our work is done through contracts or interagency agreements. Our primary goal at NCES is to provide highquality, reliable, useful, and informative statistical information to public-policy decision makers and to the general public. The NCES statistical standards and guidelines are essential to fulfilling our primary 12

11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 is present at this meeting. The nature of contractors. The ESSIN or network contractors selected to provide support services shall have a special relationship with NCES beyond that which is common to normal contractual relationship. Offerors are encouraged to read "Section VII. Nature of Contractors." This section provides details regarding structural autonomy, teaming, subcontracting, access to NCES data, and facilities, equipment, and place of performance. This is "Section VII. Nature of Contractors" in the solicitation document. Where appropriate, the government is seeking new and innovative ideas for conducting task work as described in the Performance Work Statements of this full and open competition with the small business setaside. Again, offerors are encouraged to review the nces.ed.gov website to familiarize themselves with the current products and services as you prepare your responses. At this time, Deputy Commissioner Seastrom will discuss standards, confidentiality, and provide overall remarks about the work statements. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 goal. In particular, the standards and guidelines provide a means for promoting consistency across NCES data collection and reporting efforts. They are intended for use by NCES staff and contractors to guide them in their data collection, analysis, and dissemination activities. They are also intended to present a clear statement for data users regarding how data should be collected in NCES surveys and the limits of acceptable applications and use. The NCES statistical standards and guidelines are organized around a common structure that was developed by an OMB-sponsored interagency committee as part of the 2002 government-wide information quality guidelines initiative. This common structure was also used in the subsequent development of the OMB standards and guidelines for statistical data collections. I would encourage you all to -- to look at these standards. The elements identified include Development of Concepts and Methods, Planning and Design of Surveys, Collection of Data, Processing and Editing of Data, Analysis of Data / Production of Estimates or Projections, Establishment of Review Procedures, and

14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Dissemination of Data. The standards that are currently on our website at nces.ed.gov/statprog -- one word -- were extensively revised in 2002 through a qualityimprovement approach that involved approximately onehalf of all center staff. We're currently working on a modest revision that we anticipate completing by the end of 2011. All contractor staff working on NCES contracts are expected to incorporate the NCES statistical standards and guidelines in their work for NCES. As a statistical agency, NCES work is subjected to strong confidentiality laws that guide our commitment to protecting personally identifiable information in all phases of data collection, processing, and analysis. As a result, contractors working on NCES projects that involve the use of any restricted-used data, must apply for and receive a restricted-use data license before they can access any restricted-use data from NCES. Contractors are required to comply with ED IT security requirements as described in detail in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 vary by task, these tasks typically include the planning and development of the data collection, the monitoring of the data collection while it's in the field, reviewing or knocking various aspects of data quality; for example, EDICS imputations, item performance, unit and item nonresponse bias analysis, program control checks and disclosure analysis, reviewing or preparing final data sets for release and related documentation and/or methodology report; conducting analysis for reports, tables, special tabulations; writing and producing reports, ranging from the initial release first-look reports to analysis reports to large compendia, such as the Condition of Education and the Digest of Education Statistics. Also included are reviewing reports produced for NCES by other entities, updating program-specific websites, and developing and providing training for data field staff and/or data users. There are several tasks that require specialized work for a specific data collection. Included here are production support and desktopping for annual reports and meeting support for NAEP 16

15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 RFP. In addition, all contractors must comply with the personnel security screening requirements in the -- in ED, OM:5-101 throughout the life of the contract. Specifically, all contractor and subcontractor employees must undergo personnel security screening if they will be employed for 30 days or more. The type of screaming -- screening and timing of the screening will depend upon the nature of the contractor position, the type of data the contractor employees will have access to, or the type of departmental information technology system they will access. Now I'd like to summarize some of the overarching themes in the 16 individual Performance Work Statements in the current network RFP. Of course, we encourage you to identify specific tasks or task that you are interested in bidding on and fully familiarize yourself with the content and work of the relevant NCES program and specific requirements specified in work -- in the Performance Work Statement. A number of the tasks require program management support for one or more NCES data collections. Although the specific requirements may 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 activities. There are a number of tasks that include additional statistical and methodological research on either specific data collections or on cost-cutting issues that impact multiple NCES data collections. Finally, there's one task that combines support for the NCES data confidentiality and security activities and support for center-wide technical review of all NCES products with a set of data quality monitoring and statistical research activities and one that provides center-wide support for web improvements. I would also call your attention to task number 16; it's a little different in nature. It is a expert help task. There is one task identified there, and there's a plan for that as we have used it previously as a -- as new projects come up. It serves somewhat as an incubator for new projects; short turn - quick turn-around things that we need. So that task, more than others, will require more of a description of your company's capabilities, since we're looking for a full range of experience just described in the RFP. As you can see, the wide array of requirements lends itself to the network approach that

18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 we're implementing in this procurement. I would like to thank you for your attention this afternoon, and now we are able to address the questions that were submitted in advance of today's meeting. Thank you. MS. BOYCE: Good afternoon. I'd like to discuss the next steps in the procurement process. The next steps include the release of the full solicitation or RFP on FedBizOpps, and that full solicitation will include the instructions to offerors and the evaluation criteria. That RFP will be released in early June. And all interested contractors will have 30 days to submit their proposals to all of the task orders. Within the 30 days, you will have about 10 to 15 days to submit clarification questions. Please submit those clarification questions through email, and we will answer all of those questions and submit all of the answers back -- release all the answers to the questions on FedBizOpps as an amendment to the solicitation. We would like to remind you that -- that we will reserve the right to award some of the task orders without discussion, so please submit your best offers cause we don't know if you will be -- we will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 by the date of May 19th -- we'll go through those and the answer that we are providing. Question 1 reads: Contractor shall include in its bid the names, positions, and qualifications of all staff. This requirement appears to put non-incumbents at a disadvantage. Will the names only of key staff be sufficient to meet the requirement? Reply: Thank you for this input. ED intends on changing the final solicitation to require the inclusion of the names, positions, and qualifications of staff proposed for management, leadership, and senior professional staff position. Also, because many of the tasks are firm-fixed price, and the offeror must be fully staffed and able to begin work on January 1, 2012, it is important that the government has clear knowledge of the positions, labor categories, qualifications, and hourly rates for each position the offeror proposes in order to provide the work as described. While the offeror may not be able to identify all staff by name, the offeror must provide the qualifications and hourly rates for each position proposed. 20

19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 enter into discussions with all offerors. Also, the department is committed to reaching their small-business goals, and we will be awarding as many of these task orders to small businesses as appropriate. However, all of the large business -- all of the large business contractors are required to submit a small business subcontracting plan, which includes a minimum of 37.3% of all subcontract dollars going to small businesses. The large contractor's ability to exceed this minimum of 37.3% will be evaluated as part of the evaluation criteria. And within the 37.3% of subcontracted dollars slated for small businesses, there are four additional subcategories of small businesses, which are 5% to small -- small business disadvantaged, 5% to womanowned businesses, 3% to HUD zone, and 3% to small business disabled veterans. Small-business contractors that are submitting proposals are not required to submit subcontracting plans with their proposals or small -- small business subcontracting plans -contractor plans with their proposals. Thank you. MS. MILLER: The questions that were received 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Question 2: What is the role of the project director, and how is it different from task leader? Reply: To avoid any unnecessary confusion, ED will use the term "task leader." The task leader shall carry out the overall management and leadership functions for work performed under the task order, dependent upon the Performance Work Statement and/or Statement of Objectives. The task leader may also have responsibilities for conducting some of the work. Are they to charge hours to each of the tasks? Reply: The senior staff member, i.e., task leader or senior scientist, on each Performance Work Statement is expected to function as an integral member of the contractor's staffing team and, as such, shall bill to the specific task. Next question: Can different tasks have different project directors/task leader? Yes. Next question. Can one of the statistical standards programs support task orders be full and open? Reply: No. Contractor staff hired to work

These two tasks shall be awarded to the same small business. Because the support for these two tasks comes from separate budget lines, they must be awarded and administered separately. A small business can team with a large company to offer a response. Question 4: Are the 19,000 hours of task 12 for each year or total over five years? Reply: If we exercise all options, we anticipate the use of this many hours in 2012. Next question: Task 11, subtask 5. Please clarify the amount of staffing, either per data request or for all 25 requests. Reply: For subtask 5, under the "Assumptions" section, the PWS proposes roughly one-half of an FTE over the course of one year, with estimates by labor types. Over the year, the number, kind, and complexity of requests for data products can not be predicted. NCES anticipates a need for two weeks of a task leader, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Next question: To be selected for the two groups and to be given the opportunity to compete on future tasks, do you have to be one of the contractors awarded at least 1 of the 15 task orders? Do you have to be the prime contractor on at least 1 of the task orders? Reply: There are actually 16 tasks. Yes. The ESSI network will consist of the -- of the set of contractors who are awarded 1 or more of the 16 tasks in the first competition under the contract. Members of the ESSIN are prime contractors. Will each task be awarded to a single contractor or contracting team? Or could multiple awards be made for an individual task? Reply: Yes. Each Performance Work Statement will be awarded to one contractor or contracting team. Question: The period of performance for many tasks, i.e., task 5, task 7, task 11, is 12 months base period, with annual options for years 2 through 5. Will task with the base year in option years be competed only once? Reply: Each of the 16 tasks will be awarded 24

23 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 one month of a mid-level analyst three times, and onethird FTE of a junior analyst for 25 data requests per year. Next question: Winners of task 14 and 15 may not bid on any other NAEP contracts. Reply: This is an error in the Performance Work Statement for task 14 and 15 and will not be included in the final solicitation. Next question: Are there similar restrictions for winners of task 9 (for example, not bid on TIMMS and PIAAC), 11 (FRSS and PEQIS), and 12 (NHES and ECLS-K)? No. Next question: Can small nonprofits be counted towards the 37.3% subcontracting target? Can small nonprofit bid as prime on Category B task orders? Reply: Only those companies that are certified as small businesses by the Small Business Administration are eligible to respond to Category B Performance Work Statements. Similarly, only those companies that are certified as small business by the Small Business Administration shall be counted towards the 37.3% subcontracting target. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 for a base period of 9 to 12 months, depending on the start date for the specific work, with options for years 2 through 5. ED reserves the right to terminate the task at the end of year 1, to exercise the option to continue the task with the year-one contractor, or recompete the task in any subsequent year. That's the end of the questions that we received that NCES will respond to. These are questions that we received by the 19th, the due date. I think there may be some questions that Cam (ph) will respond to today. After what you heard, if you have questions or comments now, in a few minutes we will ask you if you would like to go to the microphone, and you may read to us your question or comment. We may or may not respond to your question today; however, the answer to any questions received today, either those that you go to the microphone and ask or the ones that you write to us or write to Cam, will be answered and released along with the information today in the final solicitation. All right. Are there any questions? I ask that you go to the mic and you state your name and your

26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 company's name. Talk clearly because this is all being recorded. MR. BAUM: Herb Baum, REDA International. It concerns a comment that was made earlier and then in answer to a question. In the comments, I think you said that ED reserves the right to make one or more awards for a given task. In the answers to questions, you seem to imply that there would be one award per task, and that's contradictory information. So can you resolve that for us? MS. JOHNSON: I'm sorry. Could you go back and repeat your question? I'm so sorry. I was looking at this. MR. BAUM: In the presentation, it was noted that ED reserves the right to make one or more awards per task order. In the answers to questions that was read later on -- I think it was question nine -- you had responded that ED would make one award per task order. So I'm asking -- in my mind I see this as being two different answers to the same question. We'd just like to know which is the right one. MS. JOHNSON: All right. There will be -1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 the impression that 51% of the labor of the task had to be accomplished by the small business to avoid having a large business do all the work and the small business do the travel arrangements. So I think I would suggest some clarification that when a small business task is being issued as to what percentage of the work that is being done by the small. The second concern has to do with the department having an emphasis now on the focus on these tasks being issued as expressed tasks; in some cases, expressed level-of-effort tasks. While I have a problem with that, what I do have a concern that is where within this pre-solicitation there is some inconsistency in the federal -- in the Department of Education's implementation of fixed-price tasks. So, for example, in the monthly report, I see where the department is requiring level-of-effort by person, is requiring costs by labor, costs by category, wants to know each individual's labor rates. These, to me, are issues that typically are not part of the fixed-price tasking. If the government is really looking to do these in a fixed-price mode, then the government is 28

27 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 whenever the first part of your question that you have where there will be one or more -- that's to the Performance Work Statements. So we'll have the 15 Performance Work Statements go out -- 16, I'm sorry; 16 at this particular time. And what's going to happen is that there will be contractors selected, and they may receive -- they will be awarded one, at least, if they become a part of the network. But they may respond to more than one Performance Work Statement. So it's possible that they be awarded, you know, two, three, four task orders from the -- from the Performance Work Statements. Did that answer your question? MR. BAUM: Yes. Thank you. MS. JOHNSON: Any other questions? Don't be shy. That's what we're here for. MR. JESULAITIS: Tom Jesulaitis from AIR. And I think I have a couple of concerns about the current structure of the pre-solicitation RFP. Why I came up today in this conversation where I thought I heard you say that for the small business set-aside tasks that 51% of the total value of the task order had to be accomplished by the small business. I had been under 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 buying a product. It is buying a deliverable. It is expected to buy and accept a deliverable, and it's not buying people. So it is up to the contractor to ensure that the quality of the product is delivered such that it's acceptable. That I think it is beyond the scope for the government to require that kind of costreimbursable reporting. Same thing with key personnel; if the government is buying a fixed-price deliverable, and is what I'm hearing the government was going to do, then how the contractor delivers the work that the contractor needs in order to deliver that is the contractor's work. So I would -- you know, that's my concern, and I would hope you would take that into account as you go through again and look at the -especially the reporting requirements as it would apply. MS. JOHNSON: Thank you, Tom. MS CHANG: Being as I was just doing research on subcontracting for Cain (ph). I have the clause: 52219-4 Limitation on Subcontracting. And he is correct. The 50% refers to the cost of personnel. MS. MILLER: And with regard to the second

30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 question, the reason that we included the requirement for naming personnel has to do not with -- I think the concerns that you were thinking of -- but with the fact that in order to monitor the contractor's security and to ensure that all the staff working on projects have the necessary contractor security clearance, we -- we need to have that information as to who is working on an individual task each month so we can make sure we're in compliance with the security clearance requirements government wide. MS. JOHNSON: Any further questions? Going once, going twice. All right. Okay. One more. MS. HARDAWAY: My name is Bridgett Hardaway, and I'm with GEARS. You mentioned 16 Performance Work Statements and 25 total for the year. How many of them will be Group B? MS. MILLER: Okay. At this particular time, there are eight in Category B at this time, but that -that number's subject to change. A question received. If a successful offeror now a large business becomes a small business this fall, may the company bid on small business Group B 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 this contract in Category B and subsequently grows to a large business, is it still allowed to bid in Category B as a small business? MS. MILLER: I would say no. I would need to do more research on that. But if you're a small business, we expect that you're gonna be a small business throughout the course of the period of performance. So I don't think it would be fair if you're a small business and then your designation changes to large, you can't be in the same category with the other small businesses. That would be unfair. MR. MCAFEE: Paul McAffe from Children's Institute. First, an observation on that one. Winning one of these awards could push a small business in the large business classification so that would be an issue to address. My question is related to the 3% service disabled veteran-owned small business set-aside. Will you be requiring that those SDVOSBs be Center for Veterans Enterprise verified? MS. MILLER: Yes. We will do all verifications with the help of our small business liaison in Small Business Office. Since Helen is here 32

31 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 task in the fall? And does that have to do with the NAICS code? Whoever asked that question. By the time this solicitation goes out, it will be what you are categorized at that particular -- at that particular time. So whenever you go out and this RFP closes, by that particular date, if you're not a small business then, you know, if you -- if you come into the network as a -- if you're not a small business then you won't be able to apply for anything. But if you come in the network and your designation does change, then we would have to look at that further because you can't be a large business and then a small business. So we would look -- we would look at that further. But whatever your status is by the time you submit your proposal, that's the type -- your business type. So if it changes, we'll just look at that further. MR. TURNER: I have a follow-up question to that. I think it's slightly different. MS. MILLER: Your name. Could you please give your name and your company? MR. TURNER: I'm sorry. Mark Turner, Optimal Solutions Group. So if a small business is awarded 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 -- Helen, could you come to the mic and briefly talk about joint ventures? What that is in case there're companies here who don't understand or know what joint ventures is. MS. CHANG. There hasn't been a lot of joint ventures here for the department, and we're just learning about it. But, basically, a joint venture is a legal agreement between two small businesses. You -you go in and you form a joint venture where you set out for the purpose, maybe, of bidding on this contract, who's doing what, what you're doing, if you are both -- if you look on the SBA website -- if you are both small under the NAICS code, you can bid as a small business. But a joint venture is a legal -legal agreement. It's just not I'm -- we're gonna work together. It has its own DUNS number, and it's set up for the purpose of doing something together. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I though a joint venture could be a small and a large business. MS. CHANG: It certainly can be a small and a large, and -- but if it's a small and a large, then -then the large has the NAICS code. But whatever the

34 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 NAICS codes is, then the offeror will be a large. MR. MARKER: That's not the way other government -- pardon me. Microphones. I'm David Marker from Weststat. I know that joint ventures can be two small, but they can also be a small and a large, and with the small as the management -- there's some term for that. So it is bid as the small, and there are certain restrictions that are different than on the 51-49. So if that's the kind of joint venture you're open to, that's very important for us to know that. In other words, on the Category B, if -- if joint ventures that are a mixture of a large and small can bid together, that -- that would be very helpful for you to clarify. MS CHANG: We will have to go back to the SBA R13 to figure that out. Okay. MR. MARKER: While I'm up here, if I could just follow up on Tom Jesulaitis's very good question and Marilyn's very reasonable response though for security clearances you need to know who's working on it even if it's fixed-price. But if that's the case, if the reporting requirement could be that you have to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 we have done our research, and have some -- some valuable information for you. Are there any other questions, concerns, or comments at this time? Well if there is nothing else, next we will have our meet and greet, and that's just a time for you all to network among each other -- amongst each other. I'm not sure you all know each other. If you have any questions for us, you can ask those, but we definitely ask for you to write those down so we can publish them. And we just want to thank you for coming out and taking -- taking your time out of your busy schedule to come, and we look forward to this procurement. And thank you so much and have a great day. ***** 36

35 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 report who worked every month on it and not all of the financials that go with that, that would seem to be more in keeping with the requirements of firm-fixed price work. MS. JOHNSON: Any other questions, comments, concerns? Okay. If Helen could come back up and address or provide -- she's shaking her head no -- or provide some clarification of our understanding of joint ventures is whenever you do join a partnership, all the members become primes. Is that our understanding of that? That all the members are primes cause -- because you all will be sharing equally in those. MS. CHANG: No. No. A joint venture is a legal entity that has its own DUNS number. It's not -it's not two businesses joined -- I should say legal entity. MS. MILLER: Okay. MS. CHANG: Either large or small, but it's a legal entity with its own DUNS number. MS. JOHNSON: Well, regardless, we'll have this all posted whenever we release the solicitation, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 CERTIFICATE OF NOTARY PUBLIC I, RICK SANBORN, the officer before whom the foregoing deposition was taken, do hereby certify that the witness whose testimony appears in the foregoing deposition was duly sworn by me; that the testimony of said witness was taken by me in stenotype and thereafter reduced to typewriting under my direction; that said deposition is a true record of the testimony given by said witness; that I am neither counsel for, related to, nor employed by and of the parties to the action in which this deposition was taken; and, further, that I am not a relative or employee of any counsel or attorney employed by the parties hereto, nor financially or otherwise interested in the outcome of this action.

Questions on the ESSIN Draft Performance Work Statement

Received by Deadline of May 19, 2011

(Answers provided during May 23, 2011 Pre-Solicitation Conference)





Q1 – “Contractor shall include in its bid the names, positions, and qualifications of all staff.”  This requirement appears to put non-incumbents at a disadvantage. Will the names only of key staff be sufficient to meet the requirements?  



REPLY:  Thank you for this input, ED intends on changing the final solicitation to require the inclusion of the name(s), positions and qualifications of staff proposed for Management/Leadership and Senior Professional Staff positions. Also, because many of the tasks are Firm Fixed Price and the offeror must be fully staffed and able to begin work on January 1, 2012, it is important that the Government has clear knowledge of the positions, labor categories, qualifications and hourly rates for each position the offeror proposes in order to provide the work as described.  While the offeror may not be able to identify all staff by name, the offeror must provide the qualifications and hourly rates for each position proposed.



Q2 – What is the role of the Project Director (and how is it different from Task Leader)?



REPLY:  To avoid unnecessary confusion, ED will use the term Task Leader. The Task Leader shall carry out the overall management and leadership functions for work performed under the task order.  Dependent upon the Performance Work Statement and or Statement of Objectives, the Task Leader may also have responsibilities for conducting some of the work.



 Are they to charge hours to each of the tasks?  



REPLY:  The senior staff member (e.g., Task Leader or Senior Scientist) on each PWS is expected to function as an integral member of the contractor’s staffing team, and as such shall bill to the specific task.



 Can different tasks have different project directors/task leaders?  



REPLY:  Yes



Q3 – Can one of the Statistical Standards Program Support TOs be full and open?  



REPLY:   No, contractor staff hired to work on ESSIN Tasks 1-2012 and 2-2012 must be co-located and work as an integral team on technical review and the related data quality monitoring and special projects described in these tasks. Thus, these two tasks shall be awarded to the same small business.  Because the support for these two tasks comes from separate budget lines, they must be awarded and administered separately.  A Small Business can team with a large company to offer a response.





Q4 – Are the 19,000 hours of Task 12 for each year or total over 5 years?



REPLY:  If we exercise all options, we anticipate the use of this many hours in 2012.  



Q5 – Task 11 Subtask 5, please clarify the amount of staffing, either per data request or for all 25 data requests.  – 



REPLY:  For Subtask 5, under the assumptions section, the PWS proposes roughly one-half of an FTE over the course of one year, with estimates by labor types: “Over the year, the number, kind, and complexity of requests for data products cannot be predicted. NCES anticipates a need for two (2) weeks of a Task Leader, one (1) month of a midlevel analyst 3’s time, and one-third (.33) FTE of a Junior Analyst for 25 data requests per year.”

 

Q6 - Winners of Task 14 and 15 “may not bid on any other NAEP contracts.”  



REPLY:  This is an error in the draft PWS for Task 14 and 15 and will not be included in the final solicitation.  



Are there similar restrictions for the winners of Tasks 9 (for example, not bid on TIMSS and PIAAC), 11 (FRSS/PEQIS), and 12 (NHES and ECLS-K)? –



REPLY:  No



Q7 – Can small non-profits be counted towards the 37.3% subcontracting target?  Can small non-profits bid as primes on Category B task orders?  



REPLY:  Only those companies that are certified as small businesses by the Small Business Administration are eligible to respond to Category B Performance Work Statements. Similarly, only those companies that are certified as small businesses by the Small Business Administration shall be counted towards the 37.3% subcontracting target.



Q8 - To be selected for the two groups and to be given the opportunity to compete on future tasks, do you have to be one of the contractors awarded at least one of the 15 task orders? Do you have to be the prime contractor on at least one of the tasks?



REPLY: There are actually 16 tasks. Yes, the ESSI Network will consist of the set of contractors who are awarded one or more of the 16 tasks in the first competition under this contract.  Members of the ESSIN are prime contractors.



Q9 - Will each task be awarded to a single contractor or contractor team or could multiple awards be made for an individual task?



REPLY: Yes each Performance Work Statement will be awarded to one contractor or contractor team.



Q10 - The period of performance for many of the tasks (e.g., Task 5, Task 7, Task 11) is 12 months (base period) with annual options for years two through five. Will tasks with a base year and option years be competed only once?



REPLY:  Each of the 16 tasks will be awarded for a base period of 9 to 12 months (depending on the start date for the specific work), with options for years two through five. ED reserves the right to terminate the task at the end of year one, to exercise the option to continue the task with the year one contractor, or to recompete the task in any subsequent year. 



Q1 - The RFP associates a PWS with each task.  Each PWS describes a different mix of service types that may be applicable to NAICS codes other than 541720. The skills and expertise required to respond to the overarching BPA may differ from those required to respond to specific PWS tasks.   In addition, as drafted, the RFP requires a Category A or B offeror to submit a proposal for each task/PWS, and allows a Category A or B offeror to submit a proposal for one or more task/PWS’s, but does not require an offeror to respond to all task/PWS’s.  That is, the RFP does not require an “all or none” bid.  The RFP now lists only NAICS Code 541720 – Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities, for the entire RFP.  FAR 19.102, Size Standards, subpart (b)(1), however, requires an agency to assign a NAICS Code to each item of service solicited.  In addition, FAR 19.102(e) states that: “If a solicitation calls for more than one item and allows offers to be submitted on any or all items, an offeror must meet the size standard for each item it offers to furnish.”  Since the agency (a) is soliciting several different task/PWS’s (b) must assign a NAICS to each task/PWS solicited and (c) is allowing offerors to respond for some task/PWS’s but not all of them, we ask that Education assign a specific NAICS Code appropriate to each task/PWS?   



REPLY:  ED will assign additional NAICS Codes.



Q2 - The Draft PWS says “The ESSIN will be comprised of up to seven large and small businesses that fall under two groups, Group A and Group B.” (first sentence of the fourth paragraph on p.1). Is this the combined number for the two groups or can up to seven be selected for each group so that the total number of contractors in the ESSIN can be as high as 14? 



REPLY:  The number of ESSIN firms will not be limited to 7. The number of ESSIN firms is limited only by the number of tasks included in this first solicitation for the ESSIN.



Q3 - Will offerors have an opportunity to provide ED with information on their corporate capabilities and staff experience in the four broad project categories identified on pages 2-5 (statistical methodological research, analysis and reporting, development, project support), or will they only be able to provide this information through their response to specific tasks? 



Yes, although ED would prefer that the evidence be provided relative to the specific task on which the contractor is bidding.



Q4 - The draft PWS includes several references to the Instructions to Offerors.  Could you make this available to potential bidders?  



REPLY:  The Government is seeking information and questions from the public on the Draft Performance Work Statement at this time.  The Instructions to Offerors will be made available with the anticipated release of the RFP in June 2011.  



Q5 - When does NCES plan to release the RFP?



REPLY:  See the pre-solicitation notice posted on .  We anticipate releasing the Solicitation in June.

 

Q6 - Will this procurement be competed under the ED-SAT vehicle?



REPLY:  This is a full and open procurement as advertised on , not an EDSAT procurement.PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE

May 23, 2011

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS 

(Asked or submitted in writing during the conference)



Can a company be a subcontractor on more than one team within one category (i.e. A or B)?  

Yes, a company can serve as a subcontractor with one prime contractor on one task and also serve as a subcontractor with a different prime contractor for another task either within one of Categories A or B,  or across the categories, subject to the specified rules for serving as a prime contractor in the each category. 

May a contractor participate as a subcontractor on more than one team?  

Yes a contractor may participate as a subcontractor on more than one team.

Will past performance of the team be considered in the evaluation? 

Yes, past performance will be considered in the evaluation.  In those cases where a team is submitting a response, a past performance report must be provided for each subcontractor and or member of the team performing 20% or more of the task.

Will there be a minimum number of Task Orders to which bidders need respond (i.e. can we submit a proposal in response to only one TO or must we respond to more?  

A company can bid on as few as one task or on more than one task.  Due to the amount of time required and the expense a company might incur in developing a quality response, companies are encouraged to review all tasks and bid on those for which they are most capable of doing the work.  

Are only winning prime contractors considered the 7 ESSIN firms and eligible to bid on future tasks (i.e. would a sub be eligible to bid independently on future ESSIN tasks)?  

Contractors who are awarded a task as the prime contractor on one or more tasks in this first round of competition will form the ESSI Network.  A contractor who only participates in the tasks awarded in this first round of competition as a subcontractor is, by definition, not a prime contractor in the ESSI Network, and thus would not be eligible to independently bid on future ESSIN tasks. The number of ESSIN firms will not be limited to 7. The number of ESSIN firms is limited only by the number of tasks included in this first solicitation for the ESSIN.

Will NCES choose more than one firm for each task?

 An Option for an Orientation meeting has now been incorporated in the RFP under Startup.  If ED exercises that option, it will be awarded to each of the winning bidders. Each of the other tasks will be awarded to a single firm.  

Does requirement for DC presence, dedicated staff, and the need for a firewall to separate ESSIN work from main business apply to small business to?

Yes, for the support requested in the individual tasks to function efficiently, these requirements apply equally to both large and small businesses and to the prime contractor and any subcontractors.

 If a successful offeror, now a large business, becomes a small business this fall, may the company bid on small business (Group B) tasks in the fall? 

Following SBA guidance, large businesses will be required to re-certify at the end of the Base period plus four option periods (5 years).  Please note SBA guidance is subject to change and the Government reserves the right to request recertification at any point in the contract.  

If a small business is awarded this contract in Category B and subsequently grows to a large business, is the business still allowed to bid in Category B as a small business? 

Following SBA guidance, small businesses will be required to re-certify at the end of the Base period plus four option periods (five years).  Please note SBA guidance is subject to change and the Government reserves the right to request recertification at any point in the contract.  

Recertification is required when a small business concern becomes other than small due to acquisition or merger, such as when the contractor is acquired and operated as a subsidiary of a large business or is merged with a large business. 

To be categorized as a small business in either A or B which NAICS code will be utilized? 

 Each Task has an assigned NAICS Code.  See the Solicitation.

NCES is encouraged to use NAICS codes that allow for the greatest amount of small business utilization.  Specifically, there are NAICS for small business under $7M and those under $25M annual revenue.  Is this NCES’ plan

 Each Task has an assigned NAICS Code that describes the requirement and allows for the greatest amount of small business utilization.

Will a list of people attending the May 23 meeting be published and/or publically available?

 Yes

Would like to request release of conference attendees.

The list of conference attendees is provided.

Will you publish the attendee list? 

Yes

Many confuse Joint Ventures (JV) and Mentor Protege (MP).  Please clarify if either both will be encouraged and allowed to bid as prime for Category B.

Only SBA has an approved Mentor-Protégé Program for 8a firms (13 CFR 124.520 Mentor/ Protégé program).  SBA does not have Mentor-Protégé programs for SDVOs, HUBZone, or WOSBs. The U.S. Department of Education does not have a Mentor-Protégé Program.

In accordance with, 13 CFR 124.520(d)  Benefits. (1) A mentor and protégé may joint venture as a small business for any government prime contract or subcontract, including procurements with a dollar value less than half the size standard corresponding to the assigned NAICS code and 8(a) sole source contracts, provided the protégé qualifies as small for the procurement and, for purposes of 8(a) sole source requirements, the protégé has not reached the dollar limit set forth in §124.519.  

With the Mentor-Protégé program, SBA must approve the Mentor-Protégé agreement and any firm large or small may participate as a mentor.  If SBA approves the 8a Mentor-Protégée Agreement, the 8a firm can bid on items that are set-aside; however, there are limitations in subcontracting and the non-manufacturing rule to be considered.  Also, the 8a Mentor-Protégée must then structure a Joint-Venture Agreement when they go after a contract and the Joint Venture must be approved beforehand by SBA. 

A Joint Venture is a legal entity in the nature of a partnership engaged in the joint prosecution of a particular action for mutual profit.  FAR 9.603 provides that the government will recognize the integrity and validity of joint venture if the arrangement is identified and fully disclosed to the government.  Joint Ventures must still follow guidance of SBA size standards and NAICS codes in Table of Small Business Size Standards Matched to North American Industry Classification System Codes () to determine large or small business designation.





Questions/Comments taken from Verbatim Transcript

of Pre-Solicitation Conference of

May 23, 2011



Herb Baum, REDA International.  

In the presentation, it was noted that ED reserves the right to make one or more awards per task order.  In the answers to questions that was read later on -- I think it was question nine -- you had responded that ED would make one award per task order.  So I'm asking -- in my mind I see this as being two different answers to the same question.  We'd just  like to know which is the right one.

Response: There will be one or more contractor(s) awarded tasks in each group—A and B. For each of the sixteen (16) individual Performance Work Statements (PWS) in this first round of competition there will be one award. In this first round of competition for the ESSIN, an eligible contractor may submit proposals for as few as one or as many as the total number of Performance Work Statements open to that contractor’s Group. It is possible for a contractor to win an award for each response submitted.  A contractor could also not receive an award for any of the responses or bids submitted.  If the contractor wins multiple awards, there will be a contract for each award.  In order to be a part of the ESSI Network, a contractor must receive an award for at least one response or bid.

Tom Jesulaitis from AIR. 

I think I have a couple of concerns about the current structure of the pre-solicitation RFP.  2A. Why I came up today in this conversation where I thought I heard you  say that for the small business set-aside tasks that 51% of the total value of the task order had to be accomplished by the small business.  I had been under the impression that 51% of the labor of the task had to be accomplished by the small business to avoid having a large business do all the work and the small business do the travel arrangements.  So I think I would suggest some clarification that when a small business task is being issued as to what percentage of the work that is being done by the small.  

Response: Helen Chang—you are correct, per the FAR clause 52219-4, Limitation on subcontracting, the requirement that the small business conducts more than 50 percent of the work to be considered as the prime contractor, applies to the cost of personnel.

The second concern has to do with the department having an emphasis now on the focus on these tasks being issued as expressed tasks; in some cases, expressed level-of-effort tasks.  While I have a problem with that, what I do have a concern that is  where within this pre-solicitation there is some inconsistency in the federal -- in the Department of Education's implementation of fixed-price tasks.  So, for example, in the monthly report, I see where the  department is requiring level-of-effort by person, is requiring costs by labor, costs by category, wants to  know each individual's labor rates.  These, to me, are issues that typically are not part of the fixed-price tasking.  If the government is really looking to do these in a fixed-price mode, then the government is buying a product.  It is buying a deliverable.  It is expected to buy and accept a deliverable, and it's not buying people.  So it is up to the contractor to ensure that the quality of the product is delivered such that it's acceptable.  That I think it is beyond the scope for the government to require that kind of cost- reimbursable reporting.  Same thing with key personnel; if the government is buying a fixed-price deliverable, and is what I'm hearing the government was going to do, then how the contractor delivers the work that the contractor needs in order to deliver that is the contractor's work.  So I would -- you know, that's my concern, and I would hope you would take that into account as you go through again and look at the -- especially the reporting requirements as it would apply.

Response: ED must know the names of each person working on a task each month to ensure that each person with access to personally identifiable information has completed the required security clearance application. This is necessary to fulfill the requirements for information security and data access. 

[Part of the answer by Helen Chang, part by Marilyn Seastrom] MS CHANG:  Being as I was just doing research on subcontracting for Cain (ph).  I have the clause:  52219-4 Limitation on Subcontracting.  And he is correct.  The 50% refers to the cost of personnel. 

And with regard to the second question, the reason that we included the requirement for naming personnel has to do not with -- I think the   concerns that you were thinking of -- but with the fact that in order to monitor the contractor's security and to ensure that all the staff working on projects have the necessary contractor security clearance, we -- need to have that information as to who is working on an individual task each month so we can make sure we're in compliance with the security clearance requirements government wide.

MS. HARDAWAY:  My name is Bridgett Hardaway, and I'm with GEARS.  

You mentioned 16 Performance Work Statements and 25 total for the year.  How many of them will be Group B?  

Response: Of the 16 Performance Work Statements in this first round of competition, 8 of the 16 Performance Work Statements, or 50 percent, are in Category B—small business.  The count of 25 is an estimate, we do not know at this time the exact number of tasks that we will have, nor the final distribution of tasks between the two Categories.



A question received.  If a successful offeror now a large business becomes a small business this fall, may the company bid on small business Group B task in the fall?  And does that have to do with the NAICS code?  

The Department’s preference is to follow SBA guidance, which is subject to change, and large businesses will be required to re-certify at the end of the Base period plus 4 option years.  However, the Government reserves the right to request recertification at any point in the contract.  

MR. TURNER:  Mark Turner, Optimal Solutions Group.  

So if a small business is awarded this contract in Category B and subsequently grows to a large business, is it still allowed to bid in Category B as a small business? 

The Department’s preference is to follow SBA guidance, which is subject to change, and small businesses will be required to re-certify at the end of the Base period plus 4 option years.  However, the Government reserves the right to request recertification at any point in the contract.  

Recertification is required when a small business concern becomes other than small due to acquisition or merger, such as when the contractor is acquired and operated as a subsidiary of a large business or is merged with a large business. 

MR. MCAFEE:  Paul McAffe from Children's Institute.

First, an observation on that one.  Winning one of these awards could push a small business in the large business classification so that would be an issue to address.  My question is related to the 3% service disabled veteran-owned small business set-aside.  Will you be requiring that those SDVOSBs be Center for Veterans Enterprise verified?

Yes.  We will do all verifications with the help of our small business liaison in Small Business Office.  

Alean Miller: Since Helen is here Helen, could you come to the mic and briefly talk about joint ventures?  What that is in case there're companies here who don't understand or know what a joint ventures is.

MS. CHANG.  …

A Joint Venture is a legal entity in the nature of a partnership engaged in the joint prosecution of a particular action for mutual profit.  FAR 9.603 provides that the government will recognize the integrity and validity of joint venture if the arrangement is identified and fully disclosed to the government.  



Joint Ventures must still follow guidance on SBA size standards and NAICS codes in   Table of Small Business Size Standards Matched to North American Industry Classification System Codes ()  to determine large or small business designation.



UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  I though a joint venture could be a small and a large business.

MS. CHANG:  A Joint Venture is a legal entity in the nature of a partnership engaged in the joint prosecution of a particular action for mutual profit.  FAR 9.603 provides that the government will recognize the integrity and validity of joint venture if the arrangement is identified and fully disclosed to the government.  



Joint Ventures must still follow guidance on SBA size standards and NAICS codes in   Table of Small Business Size Standards Matched to North American Industry Classification System Codes ()  to determine large or small business designation.



MR. MARKER:  That's not the way other government -- pardon me.  Microphones.  I'm David Marker from Weststat.  I know that joint ventures can be two small, but they can also be a small and a large, and with the small as the management -- there's some term for that.  So it is bid as the small, and there are certain restrictions that are different than on the 51-49.  So if that's the kind of joint venture you're open to, that's very important for us to know that.  In other words, on the Category B, if -- if joint ventures that are a mixture of a large and small can bid together, that -- that would be very helpful for you to clarify.

MR. MARKER:  

While I'm up here, if I could just follow up on Tom Jesulaitis's very good question and Marilyn's very reasonable response though for security clearances you need to know who's working on it even if it's fixed-price.  But if that's the case, if the reporting requirement could be that you have to report who worked every month on it and not all of the financials that go with that, that would seem to be more in keeping with the requirements of firm-fixed price work.

MS. JOHNSON:  Any other questions, comments, concerns?  If Helen could come back up and address or provide -- … -- or provide some clarification of our understanding of  joint ventures is whenever you do join a partnership, all the members become primes.  Is that our understanding of that?  That all the members are primes cause -- because you all will be sharing equally in those.

MS. CHANG:  No.  No.  A joint venture is a legal entity that has its own DUNS number.  It's not --it's not two businesses joined -- I should say legal entity.

MS. CHANG:  Either large or small, but it's a legal entity with its own DUNS number.

EDUCATION STATISTICS SUPPORT INSTITUTE NETWORK





I.  BACKGROUND



The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) within the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education has the following mission:



(1) to collect and analyze education information and statistics in a manner that meets the highest methodological standards; (2) to report education information and statistics in a timely manner; and (3) to collect, analyze, and report education information and statistics in a manner that:  (A) is objective, secular, neutral, and non-ideological and is free of partisan political influence and racial, cultural, gender, or regional bias; and (B) is relevant and useful to practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and the public.  P.L. 107-279, Part C, Sec. 151(b); H.R. 3801, Part C, Sec. 151(b), 2002.



As a federal statistical agency charged with providing our nation’s education information and statistics based on large-scale surveys, assessments, and other modes of data collection, NCES has the responsibility to report its findings accurately and in a timely manner.  NCES supports a wide range of policy relevant data collection activities for many different types of data consumers and user groups.  Changes in the nation’s policymakers’ conception of the importance of education and the role of data in educational improvement has required NCES to expand both the amount and types of information it collects, analyzes, and reports.  Simultaneously, NCES is attempting to release data and statistics in a more timely manner.  



The Education Statistics Support Institute Network (ESSIN) formed under this contract will conduct work solely for NCES.  No group other than NCES will award Task Orders under this contract.  To meet its responsibilities efficiently, NCES contracts for specialized statistical support.  Currently, support is provided through two contracts establishing the Education Statistics Services Institute (ESSI) and the NAEP Education Statistics Services Institute (NESSI).  The ESSI and NESSI contracts end December 31, 2011, and it is the intention of NCES to replace the statistical support contracts with the ESSIN.  The ESSIN will be established under this solicitation as a Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Task Order Contract with all work being issued through fixed price or cost reimbursement task orders. 



The ESSIN will be comprised of large and small businesses that fall under two groups, Group A and Group B.  Approximately 25 task orders will be issued annually.  At this time, NCES plans on awarding up to 16 task orders to the selected contractors that form the ESSIN.  The remaining ten tasks orders will be competed among the ESSIN Fall 2011.



ESSIN contractors will be able to bid competitively for task orders on support tasks, varying in nature and scope, to provide a range of assistance and expert advice to support NCES’s national and international data collections and assessments, analyses, methodological research, statistical product preparation, and training programs. The task order work to be performed by the ESSIN contractors will be defined in a performance work statement which will describe the work to be performed, deliverables, and schedules.  



The ESSIN will enable NCES to continue its effort to respond to the government-wide requirements for greater accountability in contract management effectively and efficiently.        





II.  OVERVIEW OF WORK TO BE PERFORMED



As the statistical agency of the U.S. Department of Education, NCES’s work is wide-ranging and often complex and long term, with data collections and analyses often extending over many years and recurring on a periodic basis.  NCES contracts separately for each of its large collections, and that work is not part of this procurement.  This procurement to establish the Education Statistics Support Institute Network will provide NCES the technical assistance and expert advice it requires to support its national and international data collections and assessments, analyses, methodological research, statistical product preparation, and training programs.  The ESSI Network will also assist NCES in responding to the changing needs of data users, adapting rapidly to changing priorities and policy foci, and incorporating the latest scientific advances in how statistical and assessment studies are designed, fielded, analyzed, and reported.   It will serve to streamline the production and extend the expertise needed to improve the timely release of high-quality data and analyses.



During the 60-month period of performance, (January 1, 2012 – December 31, 2016) NCES anticipates the need for contractors to carry out a wide variety of activities, some of which are represented in the projects proposed (see Attachment A-1).  The work of the ESSIN falls into the four broad project categories described below.  The individual tasks may require more than one or a combination of all four types of work to be performed. 



1.  Statistical methodology research

Statistical methodology work will support the continuous improvement of the conduct of NCES data collections, the processing of data, the preparation of data files, and the analysis of data from those collections.  Priority is placed on methodological work and related theoretical underpinnings that are relevant to both the state of the field and to the particular needs of education statistics and assessment.



Examples of statistical methodology work include:



Development of innovative approaches to data collection, particularly as is related to assessment and survey response issues including computer-administered testing, adaptive testing, and interactive computer tasks, as well as developments in existing approaches that can improve them;

Methodological and statistical research in the area of measuring data quality with the goal of overall improvement;

Identification and application of statistical and/or psychometric methods used in other disciplines (e.g., psychology, economics) that may be capable of addressing statistical problems posed by NCES projects; and 

Methodological, psychometric, and statistical research into extensions and modifications of existing techniques to improve measurement and analysis.



2.  Analyses and reporting 

Such work will include both the most commonly used and advanced statistical procedures to guide studies and ensure that these studies are designed in such a way as to provide valid and reliable results, and that data collected are recorded and reported systematically and objectively.  Task orders may include original analyses and reporting, or input to NCES on the analyses and reports prepared by third-party contractors.  Statistical analysis activities will employ the most commonly accepted statistical procedures in accordance with OMB Standards and Guidelines for Statistical Surveys () and NCES Statistical Standards ().  The focus will be primarily on analysis and report writing, ongoing monitoring of key aspects of data quality in NCES data collections, reporting on data quality and timeliness across NCES data collections, and examining alternative report designs and user services that are best suited for the full range of audiences for education statistics.



Examples of statistical analyses and reporting work include:



Provision of specialized reports and data tabulations adapted to the needs of data users;

Analyses of topical issues, including report-writing using advanced statistical methods;

Cross-cutting data analyses and reports based on multiple data collections;

Ongoing monitoring and reporting of data quality and timeliness across NCES data collections;

Ongoing monitoring of coding and scoring procedures that are applied to NCES collected assessment and survey data.  Evaluation and analyses of technology-enabled systems for coding and scoring surveys such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and other NCES assessments;  

Analyses of the ongoing viability of trends in long-term data collections;

Advice on advanced correlational and multivariate statistics, and on psychometric analysis;

Report design and evaluation of user needs;

Development of quick turnaround facts reports,  fact sheets, and tabulations;

Development, adaptation and application of effective user-friendly techniques and products for presenting and disseminating statistical data and analyses; and

Training and development of training materials and techniques for analysts interested in using the agency’s data.



3.  Development

Such work will have as primary objectives to (1) focus on identifying education data needs, based on a comprehensive understanding of education issues and trends (both domestic and international and across all sectors of education); (2) identify appropriate information sources and technologies for addressing education data needs; and (3) design or adapt improved data collection and assessment instruments, including computer administered cognitive tests (such as NAEP), and statistical procedures, including item analysis using both classical and item Response theory (IRT).



Examples of development work include:



Ongoing monitoring of emerging educational policy priorities and trends;

Ongoing monitoring of findings from research in education and related fields that bear on measures for, or reporting of, national statistics;  

Ongoing identification of the audiences for education statistics and their respective needs, including identification of new audiences and needs for new analyses and reports;

Development of common definitions for data elements used in cross-national analyses and the development of procedures for sampling design and measurement to significantly improve upon the reliability of international comparisons; 

Analyses of the effects that new technologies and methods of data collection have on the operations and costs of fielding surveys, including analyses that provide cost estimates for different configurations (e.g., over-sampling specific subgroups and/or special populations, testing in various subject matter areas, surveying at various grade levels, or assessing special populations) for a particular survey or program of surveys;  

Development and maintenance of a comprehensive electronic catalog of survey variables and items, their previous uses, and justifications for inclusion;

Development and testing of new survey and assessment items (e.g., in the area of education finance and student assessment, respectively);

Development, review, testing, and analysis of cognitive and background questions;

Determination of the feasibility and cost of collecting new data based on pilot studies that field-test new approaches; 

Development, validation, and evaluation of new measures of student performance, school quality, and teacher effectiveness;

Development and implementation of quality control measures and procedures to ensure the accuracy of data collection instruments including assessments and surveys;

Development and testing of protocols for gathering observations and accounts of activities and time use of students and teachers;

Development and testing of new technologies for content analysis of school- and student-generated materials;

Development of automated data collection from administrative record systems within school districts and other agencies;

Development of an NCES strategy for working with state and local education agencies to establish data standards, and for building the capacity for automated use and access to data;

Development and testing of new approaches to determining the alignment of assessments and standards;

Analyses of the performance of survey items based on criteria such as a measure’s ability to capture a significant range of variation and its predictive validity for important outcome variables;

Development of technological applications that may improve or affect the management and operations of education data collection;

Development and testing of computer network technology that allows for rapid dissemination of statistical reports and information;

Support for upgrading the requirements for computer hardware, requirements for software compatibility, protocols for communications and file sharing, and conventions for file structure and data definitions which allow for ready access and sharing of data with users; and

Development of a support system and provision of technical assistance to provide training and information for school and district personnel who want to electronically access data (in either administrative or classroom settings), conduct analyses, and share data with other users.

Development of new course content and modes of training and provide technical assistance to provide training to external researchers using NCES data.

Development of new dissemination formats and analysis tools to improve access and increase the utility of NCES data.



4.  Project support

Such work will include technical support for NCES’s operations to plan, implement, and monitor data collection activities and to disseminate NCES data products.  Work will be characterized by a comprehensive response to central data requirements, both current and anticipated; continuity, where appropriate, to permit analyses across surveys; cost effectiveness; timeliness; and reasonableness of respondent burden.



Examples of project management work include:



Assistance in designing new or revised surveys, assessments, and other projects;

Assistance in developing analysis and dissemination plans for new surveys and other projects;

Assistance in the electronic display and dissemination of NCES products;

Review of draft products to ensure that they are easily understood and meet NCES’s Statistical Standards, tabular guidelines, and the IES Style Guide (; );

Review of draft statistical tables, graphics, and analyses for adequacy of statistical measurement and comprehensiveness of reporting to ensure a consistent quality across NCES reports according to the requirements of each program;

Development of cost estimates and projections across future years for alternate questionnaire design or sampling design strategies; and 



Contractors shall exercise such management and oversight as is necessary to ensure work is done on time, efficiently, and in accordance with established standards.  





III.  STRUCTURE OF THE ESSI NETWORK



The nature and scope of the work will vary from task order to task order, as will the requirements for contractors.  This solicitation will result in awards to two sets of contractors, Group A and Group B.  Group A is open to both large and small business contractors, which will both include individual contractors and or contracting teams.  Group B will consist only of contractors identified as Small Business contractors.  Individual task orders will be offered either as Category A—Full and Open Competition or as Category B—Small Business Set Aside.  Contractors winning awards in the first round of competition will join ESSIN as members of Group A or Group B based on their status in the Central Contractors Register (CCR). 

Small Business contractors may bid as the prime contractor on individual tasks in either category (i.e., A or B).  Although contractors in Group A may not bid as the prime contractor on individual tasks in Category B, they may be bid as subcontractors for up to 49 percent of any Category B task.  Conversely, a contractor in Group B may be bid as a subcontractor on work in Category A.  Bidding as the prime contractor or being bid as a subcontractor on an individual task in one category does not preclude participation in a bid in the other category on a different task.



Task Orders awarded to contractors in Group B will be issued under a Small Business set aside.  The group of accepted Small Business contractors will include those with the approved small business certification. 



All businesses that want to do business with the Federal Government must register in the CCR.  Businesses register in CCR for the types of work they can do by NAICS code.  The NAICS code gives a business size or dollar limitation for that type of work.  The applicable NAICS codes are the following:





A select group of qualified contractors for Groups A and B will be identified from the Technical and Business proposals submitted in response to the PWS in Attachment A-1. The Proposal Evaluation Criteria will be used to evaluate and rate the responses submitted.  Once identified, the group of qualified contractors for Groups A and B will collectively form the ESSI Network (ESSIN).   The ESSIN will receive another set of Performance Work Statements (PWS) late summer/earlyfall 2011 for ESSIN contractors to develop Technical and Business proposals. ESSIN contractors will again compete against each other for this work.  ESSIN contractors will be encouraged to team with others, both ESSIN and non-ESSIN contractors, to develop Technical and Business proposals in response to the PWS.  An overview of the process follows:



Step 1:  Responding to Performance Work Statements (PWS) & Selecting the ESSI Network 

In responding to an individual PWS in this solicitation, potential offerors must select the Group in which they are capable of working and wish to bid as a prime contractor.  Small Business contractors may bid as the prime contractor on individual PWS in either category (i.e., A or B). 

If an Offeror is eligible to bid as a prime contractor in both Groups, the offeror must select the Group in which it wants to be considered as a prime contractor for a specific task order and respond by submitting Technical and Business proposals for that PWS.   



PWS for work that will begin January 1, 2012 have been developed for Group A and Group B.  The PWS are found in Attachment A-1. Offerors for Group A must include in their response to this solicitation Technical and Business proposals for each PWS for which they want to be considered for conducting work.  Offerors for Group B must include in their response, competitive Technical and Business proposals for each PWS for which they want to be considered for conducting work. Although contractors in Group A may not bid as the prime contractor on individual PWS in Category B, they may be bid as subcontractors for up to 49 percent of any Category B PWS.  Conversely, a contractor in Group B may be bid as a subcontractor on task orders in Category A.  Bidding as the prime contractor or being bid as a subcontractor on an individual PWS in one category does not preclude participation in a bid in the other category on a different PWS.  Each offeror may bid on as many, or as few, as they choose of the individual PWS for which they are eligible and possess the required capabilities.



Step 2:  Awarding Additional Task Orders

Late summer/early fall 2011 the remaining base-year PWS will be competed among the ESSIN contractors in Groups A and B.  ESSIN contractors will submit Technical and Business proposals, again for each PWS for which they are eligible and want to be considered for conducting work.  



The Government seeks competition in the responses to the individual PWS, but offerors may join together and submit a combined response to an individual PWS.  Offerors are encouraged to read Section VII, Nature of Contractors, #2, Teaming/Subcontracting.  There will be instances in which a single contracting group does not possess the total expertise necessary to easily respond to all of the anticipated requests for task work or subtask work within a task; therefore proposed efforts by a contractor to team/subcontract will be viewed as a positive response to addressing the work needs, where appropriate.  Offerors are encouraged to team with both ESSIN and non-ESSIN contractors.  Subcontractors and consultants may be added at a later time, with the permission of the COR and the Contracting Officer (CO).  



IV.  TYPE OF CONTRACT WORK



Task orders issued under this multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded either as Fixed Price or Cost Reimbursement.  





V.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE



The period of performance for the ESSI Network shall be for 60 months, beginning January 1, 2012.  The Government anticipates awarding new tasks annually and perhaps more frequently, throughout the contract period. 



Task awards may be for any duration up to two years, subject to availability of funds, but are expected to be of one-year duration for the most part. PWS will be awarded for an initial base period during the first year of the contract, with annual options for years two through five (2 - 5), if exercised.



The Government anticipates an Optional renewal period for up to 60-months, January 1, 2017 – December 31, 2021.    





VI.  ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS



All contractors shall follow the OMB Standards and Guidelines for Statistical Surveys (; NCES Statistical Standards (); IES Style Guide (available in draft) ; the Government Printing Office’s Attributes Program for Printing and Binding ; and the NCES Guidelines, Standards and Procedures for Web Publishing as updated on the web.  



NCES is firmly committed to determining how well each project meets its goals, the quality of data collected, and its implications for future projects.  Project quality control shall be integrated into every phase of the project.  For instance, potential problems should be identified early so that possible solutions are tested as part of  a data collection’s field test.  Item reliability and validity tests must be built into the data collection efforts, non-response bias analyses should be conducted as part of the final weighting process, and survey methodology and sample design effects should be made available to all data users.  Thus, statistical quality control shall be incorporated into each project stage as appropriate.



In addition, the contractor shall adhere to all printing or publication standards of NCES, including the requirement for final NCES and/or Institute of Education Sciences (IES) review and approval of reports before they can be published.  The contractor shall use Microsoft Office Suite products or Microsoft compatible software including Word, Excel, Access, SQL, etc. for text documents, tables, and figures. The method or media for delivery will be specified in the task orders.  Text documents shall be delivered in manipulable formats unless otherwise requested.  Guidelines for software and formatting specifications of such deliverables are available in the NCES statistical standards, IES style guide, and IES web standards.



When programming and or source code is used to develop a deliverable, the contractor will be required to provide the annotated code when the deliverable is submitted to and accepted by the Government.  All intermediate and final products and supporting programming and or source code generated by work under awarded tasks are the property of the Government, and must be provided to the Government upon request.  Analyses and data developed under this contract by contractors, subcontractors, and or their partners cannot be released without written NCES approval.  Contractors, subcontractors, and or their partners may not use pre-release or restricted-use data provided under this contract for any purpose not specified in the contract without written permission from the COR and Task Leader.





VII.  NATURE OF CONTRACTORS



The ESSIN contractors selected to provide support services shall have a special relationship with NCES beyond that which is common to normal contractual relationships.  The selected contractors shall operate within an organizational structure that ensures the contractor staff’s independence from conflicting assignments, and dedication, and responsiveness to NCES’s work requirements.  It is of paramount importance that the selected contractors operate in the public interest with objectivity.  The selected contractors and their employees and agents shall be free from real and apparent conflicts of interest, financial and otherwise.  To achieve these characteristics, the selected contractors must meet the following requirements regarding structural autonomy, personnel policies, and access to NCES data.



1.  Structural Autonomy

Staff of selected contractors shall operate within their employer organizations with sufficient operational separation and autonomy to ensure that their work is independent, objective, and unbiased.  Specifically, selected contractors must provide ESSI Network staff sufficient separation from other staff and work to assure that the ESSI Network work is free from potential conflicts of interest or other sources of bias.  These safeguards must extend to accessibility to and protection of hardware and software, hardcopy material, and any other physical or intellectual features that, if accessed by staff not assigned to the ESSI Network, could have actual or perceived affects on independence, objectivity, or bias.



2.  Teaming/Subcontracting

Based upon the particular requirements and needs described in this Performance Work Statement, the contractor shall provide or maintain a network of professional consultants and/or identify appropriately qualified experts with whom the contractor may team or subcontract to provide services on a relatively rapid basis as specified by each individual order.  Historically a great deal of the work has been performed by multiple contractors working in close collaboration.  The ability and willingness to collaborate across several contractors is an essential part of the work under this contract.



3.  Access to NCES Data

NCES will provide the contractors with all data, published or unpublished, that shall be required for the projects undertaken.  The contractor shall request such data in writing and shall assure that approved restricted use data licensing agreements are in place (see ).  Contractors and or subcontractors shall not share any data without direct NCES approval.  The COR will review and approve all such requests, subject to approval from the IES Data Security Program in the NCES Statistical Standards Program (SSP).. Each contractor employee with access to personally identifiable data from NCES data collections must obtain a level 5 or 5C security clearance per the requirements in Departmental Directive OM:5-101 ().



4.  Facilities, Equipment and Place of Performance

Contractors shall have office space within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area for employees who will interact with NCES on a regular (if not daily) basis.  The ESSI Network facilities must provide a secure environment for working with and maintaining confidential data files and other related work.  NCES data must be used and maintained on machines that are not networked into a company’s general network; work must be done in a physical space that allows access only by staff with appropriate clearance and independent from other work that would raise conflict of interest issues; must have sufficient secure storage and restricted access of hours.  Contractors with access to restricted use data prior to approval by the IES Disclosure Review Board must have their computer system go through the Department of Education approved certification and accreditation (C&A) process.  The contractor’s overall facilities shall include sufficient information processing equipment, software, telecommunication access, and storage to conduct basic development and research work as described in the Overview of Work to Be Performed (Section II).  The equipment shall include microcomputers, modems suitable for working on mainframe computer facilities, laser printers, and graphics capability. Contractors shall have available FAX and scanning equipment to facilitate communication with NCES.  This will ensure rapid transmission of needed information.



Portions of the contractor’s staff located elsewhere, but who have responsibility for supporting task work, shall be linked electronically to their Washington, D.C. location so that the remote location of staff is as transparent as possible.  Staff who work in remote offices will need their computer system firewalled from the parent company networks.  All restricted use data must be transmitted to remote locations using encrypted data and via an NCES secure server. NCES will make available to the contractor temporary working space at the NCES facility when specific projects require this (e.g., supporting NCES license application system, hard coding transcripts and other open ended survey items and confidential documents, collaboration with NCES staff, working with extensive files that would be costly to duplicate or move).  





VIII.  START UP



The Government anticipates the first day of work to be January 1, 2012.  Unless otherwise specified, on January 1, 2012, the contractor should be prepared to carry out the project work described in Performance Work Statements issued under the Task Orders (TOs).  



The Government may decide to hold a one-day Orientation meeting in the Fall of 2011, after the initial task awards that form the ESSIN have been made.  Each ESSIN contractor will identify two members of the leadership team for each task awarded to attend the Orientation meeting.  The meeting will be held at the NCES offices in Washington, DC.  ED expects all contractor staff to be fully trained and ready to start work January 1, 2012; thus, the meeting will provide an Orientation to NCES’ Statistical Standards, with the expectation that the task leaders will be responsible for conveying this information to their staff members. In addition, the contractor staff who require security clearances need to complete the electronic e-QIP application, submit the signature page, other required forms, and fingerprint cards to the NCES Security Program within one (1) day of starting work (this is most contractor staff). To facilitate this process, NCES Security staff will provide an orientation on the e-QIP system. The leadership team selected for each task will also have an initial orientation meeting with the NCES Task Leader and Project Director.  All proposals should include an option that includes the cost of two leadership staff members attending this 8-hour Orientation meeting for each task for which a proposal is submitted. 



The Government may decide to exercise an Optional Task and implement a transition period for certain tasks, if funding permits.  The transition period would allow the current contractor to conduct information sessions with new ESSIN contractors to support a smooth transfer and or handoff of contract work that must begin on January 1, 2012.  The transition period, if implemented, would not affect the contract periodicity detailed in section V.  If a transition period is necessary, the Period of Performance will be December 5-16, 2011.   No other start-up costs are anticipated to support work under this contract.  A list of tasks and the number of hours required during the transition period of performance follows.










IX.  GENERAL MANAGEMENT



Each contractor and or its organization shall exercise such management control as is necessary to ensure task order work is done on time, efficiently, and in accordance with established standards.  General task management shall include, but not be limited to, the following activities:  (1) personnel recruitment, evaluation, and oversight; (2) work assignment and oversight of progress and quality of work; (3) adherence to schedule and quality standards; (4) monitoring and oversight of contract budget; (5) communication on a frequent basis with the COR and the COR’s designees regarding the specific projects awarded to each selected contractor; (6) reporting functions; and (7) contract administration to ensure compliance with its terms and conditions.  



1.  Annual Plan

Each year NCES will develop an Annual Plan consisting of Performance Work Statements for the ESSIN contractors in Groups A and B to bid on.  The work will be divided into two categories. Category A will include task orders that can be bid upon by the contractors pre-selected for Group A and Group B.  



Category B will consist of Small Business set aside work.  Only contractors pre-selected for Group B with the approved Small Business identification can bid upon task orders in this category.



For the initial year (i.e., base year) of the contract, ESSIN contractors will respond to the PWS for 2012 previously described in Section III, Structure of the ESSIN, Steps 1 and Step 2.  For the second through fifth contract years, no later than three (3) months before the end of each year the contractor shall receive PWS for work to be performed in the succeeding period.  The contractor shall prepare competitive Technical and Business proposals responsive to these PWS.  It is estimated that each year there will be 15-25 PWS for which contractors will prepare and submit proposals.  The contractor’s proposals shall include schedules, descriptions of major deliverables, staff loading charts and staffing plans, line item budgets, and such other information as shall be requested.  Once the Annual Work Plan is agreed upon, an award of funds will be made and the contractors will commence work. This schedule does not preclude the Government from issuing additional PWS during any year of the contract.  All eligible ESSIN contractors will be notified when ESSIN PWS are issued.



Work requirements in each Annual Work Plan may call for changes in staffing arrangements.  The contractor shall be flexible in both the numbers and types of staff members to be employed each year and the work assigned to these individuals.  Additionally, during the contract year, the Government may decide to modify the current contract.  The modification may result in a change of staff.  The contractor must be flexible and able to meet the staffing needs as a result of the modification.

   	

It is expected that many of the projects will be ongoing.  Similar or new work will continue under new Task Orders awarded in ensuing years. If an ongoing or similar task order is awarded to a different contractor in a subsequent year, the prior year’s contractor will cooperate in the transition of knowledge and materials if requested by the COR through a transition task. For certain tasks, it will be essential that work is coordinated among several contractors. Teaming and subcontracting efforts will be viewed as a positive response to addressing the work identified in the PWS when it supports the overarching goals of timely, high-quality products, and when it can be executed in a cost-effective manner.



2.  Monthly Reports

The Contractors in both Group A and Group B shall submit monthly reports on or before the 10th of each month.  The monthly reports are to be submitted via paper and electronic transmission.  The monthly report shall be submitted to the project Task Leader and Project Director with a copy to the COR and the specified Contracting Specialist.  



The report shall include the following:



The progress on each task and activity relative to the schedule and a discussion of discrepancies;

Accomplishments associated with each task and activity for the month;

Problems that have been resolved or are in need of resolution;

A discussion of the work to be performed during the next monthly reporting period;

The number of hours expended by all contractor staff by staff person;

The number of hours expended by all subcontractor staff by person;

Brief description of the work performed by each subcontractor during the month;

Funding expended by major category, including staff, travel, consultant, subcontractors, and other costs, including obligated costs of subcontractors; and

Expected future technical and budgetary problems and proposed solutions to these.





X.  PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS



Contractors shall establish a performance measurement system that shall support the project management function through a series of interrelated activities that include:



Development and use of detailed production schedules that define and organize contract work;

Use of contractor management control systems that facilitate performance measurement within the work breakdown structure; and

Use of a reporting system to report contract status.





XI.  CONFIDENTIALITY, SECURITY, IT, WEBSITE, & OTHER REQUIREMENTS

Data Security Plan



Definition of Personally Identifiable Information and Direct Identifiers

The term “personally identifiable information” (hereinafter PII) means any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as their name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, biometric records, etc., including any other personal information which is linked or linkable to an individual. The term “direct identifier” denotes any single datum that alone is deemed sufficient to yield a high risk of disclosure if released, such as social security numbers, full names, or biometric records.



Development of Data Security Plan 

The contractor shall present a detailed security plan that expands upon what was presented in the proposal to the COR for approval. In order to ensure the anonymity of individual respondents, the contractor must draft and execute this plan in compliance with all relevant laws, regulations, and policies governing the security of data, particularly PII. These include (but are not limited to):

Section 183 of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002, which states:

IN GENERAL - All collection, maintenance, use, and wide dissemination of data by the Institute, including each office, board, committee, and center of the Institute, shall conform with the requirements of section 552a of title 5, United States Code, the confidentiality standards of subsection (c) of this section, and sections 444 and 445 of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g, 1232h).

STUDENT INFORMATION - The Director shall ensure that all individually identifiable information about students, their academic achievements, their families, and information with respect to individual schools, shall remain confidential in accordance with section 552a of title 5, United States Code, the confidentiality standards of subsection (c) of this section, and sections 444 and 445 of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g, 1232h.;

CONFIDENTIALITY STANDARDS – In general, the Director shall develop and enforce standards designed to protect the confidentiality of persons in the collection, reporting, and publication of data under this title. This section shall not be construed to protect the confidentiality of information about institutions, organizations, and agencies that receive grants from, or have contracts or cooperative agreements with, the Federal Government. No person may use any individually identifiable information furnished under this title for any purpose other than a research, statistics, or evaluation purpose; make any publication whereby the data furnished by any particular person under this title can be identified; or permit anyone other than the individuals authorized by the Director to examine the individual reports. 

The Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a);

The E-Government Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347);

The relevant sections of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations entitled “Protection of Human Subjects” (34 CFR 97); 

The U. S. Department of Education OCIO-1 Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy (January 2009);

Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-06-19, “Reporting Incidents Involving Personally Identifiable Information and Incorporating the Cost of Security in Agency Information Technology Investments”;

OMB Guidance of 7/12/2006 on the Reporting of Incidents Involving Personally Identifiable Information (M-06-19).



The data security plan will, at a minimum, cover the following issues: the transfer/transport of PII, maintenance, storage, and use of direct identifiers, replacement of direct identifiers with internal codes, security of master survey files, security and confidentiality training for contractor staff, and reporting of data security breaches.  Hence, the data security plan shall be written to place particular emphasis on the following aspects of confidentiality and security:



Guidelines for Transfer of PII

As a general principle, the physical and/or electronic transfer of PII (particularly direct identifiers) shall be limited to the extent practicable. This limitation includes both internal transfers (e.g., transfer of information between agents of the contractor, including subcontractors and/or field workers) and external transfers (e.g., transfers between the contractor and the agency, or between the contractor and another government agency or private entity assisting in data collection).



When it is necessary for the contractor to transfer PII, such transfer must occur in a manner that maximizes the security of information. The data security plan must describe the likely modes of data transfer and establish the most secure procedures practicable. The most secure method of transferring sensitive information is not necessarily the most efficient or convenient one.



The preferred means of transferring PII (and particularly direct identifiers) is electronic transfer with 128-bit secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption. 

If electronic PII is transferred via physical media (e.g. a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is created and sent via courier service or mail), all files on the media shall be encrypted (FIPS 140-2 standard) with a strong password (e.g., a random string of letters and numbers) and this password shall be sent separately from the data. In addition, no obvious external markings or information identifying the media as containing PII shall be written, stamped, or otherwise inscribed on the media or its packing material.

If paper records or files must be transferred, then the contractor and its agents should hand carry these documents for delivery.  Shipping or mailing these kinds of documents should be avoided.  The contractor should clearly state in their data security plan if this requirement cannot be met.  The data security plan should describe all transfers of paper records or files and how they will be secured.  If these documents must be shipped/mailed, the contractor and it agents should avoid transferring multiple direct identifiers in the same shipment. For example, a mailing containing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of subjects is less secure than two mailings: one shipment with the names and addresses and a second shipment with the social security numbers and no additional information.  Alternatively, a partial mailing of data could be followed up with a telephone call (for smaller amounts of PII) which provides the remainder of the data verbally.  Any shipment sent must have a tracking number.  As above, no obvious external markings or information identifying the mailing as containing PII shall be written, stamped, or otherwise inscribed on the packing material.



Maintenance, Storage, and Use of Direct Identifiers

Under no circumstances may the contractor release PII to unauthorized individuals. In addition, direct identifiers must be maintained in files which are physically separate from other research data, and which are accessible only to sworn agency and contractor personnel. Individual direct identifiers used during the course of the project shall be associated with data only for statistical purposes such as data gathering, matching new data with old, establishing sample composition, authenticating data collections, editing data based on callbacks, or obtaining missing information. 



As a general principal, the number of personnel with access to PII (and particularly direct identifiers) shall be restricted to the smallest number as possible.



Replacement of Direct Identifiers with Internal Codes

Although direct identifying information is often required in the data collection process, to the extent practicable the contractor shall use internally generated identifying codes to track subjects in data files. Whenever possible, the transfer and storage of files containing multiple direct identifiers should be avoided. If the transfer of direct identifiers is required for statistical purposes such as data matching, the minimum number of direct identifiers needed for successful matching shall be used.



Security of Master Survey Files

The contractor shall maintain security on the complete set (and deliverable backups) of all master survey files and documentation.



Clearance for Access to Restricted Data  



Contractors shall secure NCES authorization to use restricted use (i.e., personally identifiable information (PII)), NCES data necessary to conduct their work.  Upon receiving this authorization, the contractor and their staff identified to use restricted data shall participate in an orientation session and sign an Affidavit of Nondisclosure that includes the same restrictions and penalties that apply to NCES staff should individually identifiable data be disclosed.  Because of the special working relationship between the NCES and the contractor, authorization shall apply to an entire set of data for the length of the contract.  Each contractor employee whose work requires access to PII must obtain a level 5 or 5C security clearance. Contractor employees not submitting appropriate documentation of an existing clearance shall apply for the required clearance through the electronic clearance application system that ED uses for federal and contractor employees (i.e., the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) e-QIP system). Offerors shall identify in their proposal the list of persons and/or positions that will require security clearances.



Affidavit of Nondisclosure

Any contractor employee needing access to confidential information under this contract shall first sign an Affidavit of Nondisclosure.  Before any contractor employee starts work on the contract and has access to confidential information, a signed Affidavit of Nondisclosure must be completed.  As new staff start and require access to confidential information or as staff who originally did not require such access subsequently need it, an Affidavit of Nondisclosure shall be executed for them on the first working day of the assignment.  The contractor shall indicate the position in the organization of the person signing the Affidavit of Nondisclosure, and the person’s functional relationship to this project in a memorandum provided to the COR.



The contractor shall execute these Affidavits of Nondisclosure and the contractor shall maintain the originals at its office.  The contractor shall make Acrobat pdf copies of new Affidavits as they are completed.  Throughout the life of the contract, the memorandum and Affidavits of Nondisclosure for new project staff, as well as interviewers and other short-term personnel, will be submitted on a schedule negotiated with the COR or, at a minimum, three times a year. The contractor shall be able to produce the original hard copies of the Affidavits within a few hours notice from the COR.  The NCES data security officer can provide blank copies of the Affidavits upon request.



Pursuant to 3452.239-72 Department Security Requirements (MAR 2011)

The Department has established policy on personnel security screening for all contractor and subcontractor employees and their field staff set forth in the Bidder’s Security Package: Security Requirments for Contractors Doing Business with the Department of Education at . The relevant Departmental Directive is OM:5-101.  It was last updated in July 2010 and can be found at:   . The contractor must comply with the personnel security-screening requirements in OM:5-101 throughout the life of the contract.

All contractor and subcontractor employees must undergo personnel security screening if they will be employed for thirty (30) days or more. 



The type of screening and the timing of the screening will depend upon the nature of the contractor position, the type of data the contractor employee will have access to, or the type of Departmental information technology (IT) system they will access. Personnel security screenings will be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm the individual could cause to the Department or the public. A position risk level will be assigned to each contractor employee position, before a solicitation is released, consistent with the descriptions in  of OM:5-101. Hence, each contractor employee working on this contract must be assigned a position risk level. Depending on the risk level assigned to each person's position, a follow-up background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may occur.



The contractor must identify one of their employees as a security liaison for this process. This Contractor Security Liaison coordinates the distribution, collection, and dissemination of various forms required in this process. They answer general questions from their employees on completing the security screening process. And, they are the first point of contact for contractor employees in using the OPM’s Internet based security screening portal called e-QIP

(  ). The contractor is also responsible for ensuring that all subcontractors follow these personnel security screening procedures.



NCES requires each contractor employee to have or apply for a clearance for the security level designated for the position held on a contract. 



Contractor employees who have undergone appropriate personnel security screening for another Federal agency will be required to submit proof of that personnel security screening for validation. For these employees, the contractor or subcontractor must follow these required steps:



The contractor must send the COR a letter on Company letterhead that lists the full name of each employee with a pre-existing clearance, the agency that cleared the employee, the level of the clearance, and the date of the clearance. This letter must be transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of starting work on an NCES contract. 

In those cases where any of the required information on level of clearance, agency that cleared the employee and date of clearance is not available, the contractor must send the COR a letter on Company letterhead that lists the full name and Social Security Number for each employee with a pre-existing clearance. This letter must be transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of starting work on an NCES contract. 

The COR will transmit the letter to the NCES Security Representative for processing.

The NCES Security Representative reviews the letter to ensure that the required information is provided and either returns it to the contractor for completion or releases it to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security. The contractor must resubmit the letter to the COR within 7 business days or the contractor employee must be removed from the contract.

The NCES Security Representative will notify the contractor or subcontractor if the pre-existing clearance was identified and ruled to be acceptable by the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security.

Those employees whose pre-existing clearances are not verified and approved must follow the process outlined next to apply for a security clearance. 



For contractor employees who have not undergone appropriate personnel security screening for another Federal agency, all contractors must comply with the Principal Office (PO) Executive Office or Computer Security Officer’s pre-processing requirements for personnel security screening and granting access privileges. No contractor employees are permitted unsupervised access to unclassified sensitive information (i.e., personally identifiable information), direct access to respondents who are minors, or Department of Education IT systems until they have submitted applicable security screening documents.  



For each contractor employee in a moderate risk level position the completed security screening documents must be accepted by the COR and the NCES Security Representative and submitted to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security within 14 days of the date the contractor employee starts working on the contract. In order to meet this Departmental requirement, steps 1 through 7 must be completed within 14 days of the date the contractor employee starts working on the contract. To meet this 14 day deadline and the interim deadlines specified below, it is strongly recommended that the contractor request the account initiation three (3) weeks before the contractor employee starts contract work and encourage each contractor employee to complete all required security screening forms before starting contract work.



Contractor employees in High Risk IT (6C) Level positions require preliminary personnel security screenings before they are given access to unclassified sensitive information or Department of Education IT systems (see page 7 of OM:5-101 for more details). 



The security screening of contractor and subcontractor employees not holding ED recognized security screening credentials must follow these required steps:

The contractor must provide the COR with an electronic listing of all employees on a specific contract, with the risk level associated with the position held by each employee as specified in the contract solicitation.  The COR will review the electronic listing for completeness and approve. The listing will not be approved if it is found to be incomplete.

The Department of Education participates in the OPM e-QIP system to facilitate the security screening process for contractor employees. NCES will initiate an e-QIP account for each contractor employee. It is advisable to request the account initiation three (3) weeks before the contractor employee starts contract work. For the initiation of these accounts, the Contractor Security Liaison must use the COR-approved list of employees and the risk levels assigned to the employees’ positions to produce and submit the following list using the attached template:

For each contractor employee provide:  Social Security Number, Full Name, Date of Birth, Place of Birth, risk level, e-Mail Address, and phone number. The Contractor Security Liaison must place the spreadsheet in a password protected file, then upload the list to the NCES secure server, and send an e-mail notification of the transmission to the NCES Security Representative. The NCES security staff will use this list to establish the contactor employee e-QIP accounts. The COR will work with the contractor to establish access to the NCES secure server at the outset of the contract. 

Once NCES sets up the e-QIP accounts for contract employees, the NCES Security Representative will send an email to the Contractor Security Liaison stating that the employee has an active account on the e-QIP system. The COR is copied on this email notification. 

The Contractor Security Liaison must notify their employees of this active account. A computer with Internet access and web browsing software is required for the contractor employee to access their E-QIP account. Each employee must log into their personal account in e-QIP, enter the requested information, finish the application process and print, sign, and date the e-QIP signature pages.

3.   Each contractor employee must submit a completed set of security screening forms to their Contractor Security Liaison as provided by the NCES Security Representative, including for example:

The signed and dated e-QIP signature pages,

The Declaration of Federal Employment (OPM form OF-306),

 The Fair Credit Release Form, 

The Request for Security Officer Action (RSA) Form, 

The contractor employee shall complete only those items in section 1 of the form (name, date of birth, place of birth, organization, position title, duty station, social security number, and work phone number).

The contractor shall complete section 5 (Project Requiring Highest ADP Level) using the assigned security clearance for each employee’s position. 

Two sets of fingerprints on separate copies of form FD-258,

The Contractor Security Liaison shall help arrange fingerprinting for each contractor and subcontractor employee.  Fingerprinting can usually be done at a local police station. (Electronic fingerprints are not accepted at this time.)

4.  Each contractor must ensure that the forms are complete and that all contractor employee required security screening forms are transmitted to the COR within one (1) business days of an employee starting work on an NCES contract. 

The Contractor Security Liaison must collate the forms in each security screening package by employee and transmit a complete set of security screening documents for each employee to the COR via courier (e.g., Federal Express) using a tracking number with signature required, 

The COR will not accept security screening packages that are not collated by employee (i.e., all forms noted in point 3 above will be bundled by employee).  The COR will review all security screening documents for each contractor employee for completeness, returning any incomplete security screening documents to the Contractor Security Liaison for completion. The contractor must resubmit the completed security screening documents to the COR within 7 business days or the contractor employee must be removed from the contract. No contractor employees are permitted unsupervised access to unclassified sensitive information (personally identifiable information), direct access to respondents who are minors, or Department of Education IT systems until they have resubmitted applicable screening documents.

The COR will submit the completed packages of security screening documents to the NCES Security Representative for processing.

The NCES Security Representative reviews each package of security screening documents and electronic information submission to ensure everything required has been provided and either rejects the package, sending it back to the submitter for completion/correction or releases it to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security. In the event that an application is rejected at this stage, the contractor must resubmit the corrected forms to the COR, or have the contractor employee correct the e-QIP submission, within two business days. The NCES Security Representative must be notified as soon as the updated e-QIP submission is completed.

The contractor employee application for each individual in a moderate risk level position must be submitted to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security within 14 days of the date the contractor employee starts working on the contract. Contractor employees in High Risk IT (6C) Level positions require preliminary personnel security screenings before they are given access to unclassified sensitive information or Department of Education IT systems. 

After a package of security screening documents is transmitted to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security, the Office of Management security staff conducts a further review and either rejects the package of security screening documents, sending it back to the submitter for completion/correction or releases it to OPM.

OPM then assigns an investigator to conduct the type of investigation indicated by the department (this is tied to the level of access to PII that the applicant will have).

The Chief of Personnel Security will request the expansion of background investigations to obtain additional information to the extent necessary to make personnel acceptability or suitability determinations.   These determinations will be made using criteria established by the OPM for the purpose of determining suitability for employment in the Federal competitive service, as described in 5 CFR 731.202, and other OPM guidance as applicable.  The Chief of Personnel Security determines whether a contractor employee is acceptable for the position from a personnel security standpoint.

When the OPM investigation is complete, the RSA form with the clearance indicated is sent to the Department of Education’s Office of Management for processing.

The Office of Management returns the RSA form to the NCES Security Representative for recordation and distribution to the COR.

The COR transmits the RSA form with clearance indicated to the Contractor Security Liaison for their records and for distribution to the Contract Project Leader.

The Contract Project Leader then distributes copies of the clearance to the employee.  

The Chief of Personnel Security will inform the NCES COR when he or she determines that a contractor employee is not acceptable to render service(s) or, if appropriate, to otherwise perform under a contract.  

Each contractor will officially notify its contractor employee if he or she will no longer work on an ED contract.

In the event a contractor employee is deemed unacceptable for the position from a personnel security standpoint, the Chief of Personnel Security will usually provide the contractor employee with an opportunity to refute, explain, clarify, or mitigate information in question. 

If, after final determination by the Chief of Personnel Security, a decision is made that the contractor employee is not acceptable to render services on a contract and access is denied, the COR will inform the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer must inform the contractor (i.e. employing firm) that the contractor employee is not acceptable to render services in this particular position, or, if appropriate, to otherwise perform under the contract.  The contractor will notify the contractor employee.  A final determination cannot be appealed.

At any time during the life of the contract a contractor or subcontractor employee (including any field staff) discontinues work on the contract or leaves the employment of the contractor, the contractor shall notify the COR within two days of the date that the employee is no longer working on the contract or within one business day if removed for cause. The contractor shall provide the reason why the employee is no longer working on the contract. The COR will provide this information to the NCES Security Representative.

Each contractor is responsible for the protection of sensitive or Privacy Act-protected information from unauthorized use or misuse by its employees, subcontractors, or temporary workers, and for preventing access to others, who are not authorized and have no need to know such information.

The contractor shall submit monthly information to the COR indicating which employees were billed to the contract that include the e-QIP number of the person being billed.  The COR will reject payments to employees without an e-QIP number.  For employees with pre-existing clearances from other contracts, this shall be noted on the monthly payment form.



The contractor shall verify with the COR that the security screening processes have not changed by the time the contract is active.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT 



Task 3:  Review of NCES Data Collection Efforts/Structure and New Initiatives



I.  Background 



The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is charged with the acquisition, analysis, interpretation, dissemination, and reporting of statistical data reflecting the condition and progress of education at all levels in the United States and on educational activities and student achievement compared with foreign nations. It serves as the principal federal source of education statistics obtained from educational institutions, individuals, practitioners, state and local agencies, and other federal agencies (). Certain statistical data obtained by the Center are used for the purpose of allocating formula-grant federal assistance funds to state and local education and library agencies. Other statistical data released by the Center are extensively used in policy analyses and support a number of significant research efforts.  As a part of ongoing strategic planning, and in support of its efforts to provide high quality, relevant data, the NCES Commissioner periodically undertakes multidisciplinary reviews of the Center’s data collection efforts and structures by nationally recognized outside experts.

In addition, in support of the NCES mission, the Statistical Standards Program (SSP) in the Office of the Deputy Commissioner periodically requires expert help involving the services of nationally recognized experts through working groups focused on specific statistical and methodological topics.  The NCES Statistical Standards Program (SSP) provides methodological and statistical support to NCES, as well as to federal and nonfederal organizations that engage in statistical work in support of NCES's mission. SSP takes the lead in developing and maintaining the statistical and survey methodology standards that ensure the quality of statistical surveys, analyses and products (); consults and advises on the implementation of standards for all NCES projects; conducts internal technical reviews for all NCES publications and products (see the NCES electronic publication catalog at  for examples of existing NCES publications and products); and coordinates the revision of the NCES Statistical Standards. SSP also monitors and administers confidentiality procedures (see  for information on the NCES confidentiality program) and related restricted-use data licenses (see  for information on the licensing process) for NCES data products. In addition, SSP consults and advises on emerging statistical issues and initiates, monitors or participates in long-term statistical and methodological research projects. 



II. Purpose



NCES requires technical and statistical support in forming multidisciplinary working groups of nationally recognized experts to conduct best-practice reviews of its data collection efforts and structures and provide expert input on current practices as specific areas for review are identified.  NCES also requires expert technical and statistical support from working groups of recognized experts to provide input on new and emerging statistical and methodological topics.



III.  Scope of Work



Task 1 -- Initial Meeting 

The contractor shall meet with the NCES task leader within one week of award to review activities and refine the task schedule.  The contractor shall submit a summary of the meeting, including any revisions to the schedule, to the NCES task leader within one week of the meeting.

	

Task 2 -- Data Collection Efforts and Structure Reviews

The contractor shall support NCES, Office of the Commissioner, review projects that require multidisciplinary nationally recognized expertise and/or in-depth knowledge of NCES’s data collection efforts and structures.

NCES anticipates that each of the topics identified in Tasks 2 and 3 may take one of the following three forms: 

Exploratory Issue Workshop – three to five experts start with one expert in-person meeting involving NCES staff (workshop) to explore and discuss issue(s) which will result in a workshop proceedings summary report.  

Review Panel – three to five experts start with an initial expert in-person meeting involving NCES staff to explore and discuss the topic with one or more follow-up working teleconferences culminating in a second expert meeting to present and discuss results and a report defining the issues and panel suggestions. 

Problem and/or Research Project – three to five experts start with one expert in-person meeting involving NCES staff to define problems and identify research question, followed by a senior statistical researcher and post-doctoral support staff (mid-level analyst) conducting methodological work to explore/resolve questions, culminating in a meeting with the researcher to present and discuss results  and a research results report



The maximum numbers of working groups specified in Task 2 or 3 will be initiated if the projects undertaken are all of format 1 or a mix of formats 1 and 2. A smaller number of working groups will be initiated in Task 2 or 3 if the projects undertaken are all of format 3 or a mix of formats 2 and 3. Thus the labor hours anticipated for the Task Leader and the Mid Level Analyst will not vary, regardless of the form and number of working groups initiated.



The nationally recognized experts who are identified (vetted and approved by NCES) and recruited to serve on the working groups will be reimbursed for meeting travel and lodging costs and be paid via honoraria for their participation using a separate NCES logistics contract.  



The Government estimates that the total level of effort required to undertake the tasks described in this Performance Work Statement is approximately 1.2 person years (1 person year equals 1 FTE or 2,080 hours).  The time of the experts is not included.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



Task 5:  SASS Support


I.  Background



ED/NCES conducts a number of data collections within the NCES legislative mandate to report on the condition of education - within this Support Task, these data collections are: the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), the Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS), the Principal Follow-up Survey (PFS), and the Beginning Teacher Longitudinal Study (BTLS.  SASS is collected every 4 years, with 2011-12 being the current collection; the TFS is collected the next school year, in 2012-13, the PFS also is collected in 2012-13.  BTLS is conducted once every year and is in its fifth wave of data collection in 2012.  The TFS and the PFS are one-year follow-ups of respondents to the SASS Teacher and Principal surveys, respectively.  Specific information about these surveys can be found at the following websites:  for SASS, TFS, and PFS; and  for BTLS. The fielding of the data collections is handled through interagency agreements with two different units at the Census Bureau.  In addition to planning and releasing data files from the surveys, ED/NCES is also called upon to provide special analyses as requested by policy makers, to produce reports using the data, to do training in how to analyze the survey data, and to be the ED experts on new and emerging topics related to teacher quality, principals as instructional leaders, school climate, school staffing, teacher working conditions, school district policies, private schools, and teacher and principal attrition and mobility.  One federal employee, located in the Sample Survey Studies Program of the Elementary, Secondary and Library Statistics Division of NCES, manages the portfolio of work associated with school staffing and teacher issues (COR); one federal employee, located in the Sample Survey Studies Program of the Elementary, Secondary, and Library Statistics Division of NCES, manages the portfolio of work for the longitudinal analysis of teachers’ career paths for beginning teachers (Task Leader).   To meet the volume of work associated with this topic area, ED/NCES requires support with program-related tasks.



II.  Purpose



The US Department of Education (ED)/National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has a requirement to obtain program management support for a range of school and teacher work in the Elementary, Secondary and Library Statistics Division. Specifically, support is required in three areas:  1) support with daily survey management functions related to the Schools and Staffing Survey, Teacher Follow-up Survey, Principal Follow-up Survey, and Beginning Teacher Longitudinal Study ; 2) support with data products, web tables, and reports related to the Schools and Staffing Survey, Teacher Follow-up Survey, Principal Follow-up Survey, and the Beginning Teacher Longitudinal Study; 3) support with ED/NCES’s overall agenda related to school, school district, teacher, principal and school library data.



 III.  Scope of Work

The contractor shall participate in the portfolio of work associated with school and teacher issues under the leadership of the ED/NCES project directors for this work.  The contractor shall perform program management support functions in support of the work.  The contractor shall be innovative in further assessing the Department’s requirements for efficiency in production and relevance of survey content and making sure they are achieved.  

Task 1 – Initial Meeting 

The contractor shall meet with the NCES task leader and Census Bureau staff within one week of award to review the current status of ongoing activities, receive deliverables from the previous contract year, review project coordination requirements, refine the task schedule, and to engage in a question-and-answer session if needed with the Task Leader and Census Bureau staff.  The contractor shall submit a summary of the meeting, including any revisions to the schedule, to the NCES task leader within one week of the meeting.

Task 2 -- Support for the Schools and Staffing Survey

At the beginning of calendar year 2012, SASS is half-way through data collection for the 2011-12 school year.  The Census Bureau handles all field-related work, such as mailing out questionnaires, performing telephone and online survey follow-up, coordinating with school districts which require advance approval, and will perform the data processing activities on a flow basis.  As soon as completed survey questionnaires are prepared for processing, and continuing after the end of field data collection, the Census Bureau will perform the data processing activities and provide draft versions of the data files for quality control to the Task Leader, who will provide them to the contractor. The Census Bureau will also implement tabulation specifications for First Look reports and the Data File User’s Manual report.  The 2011-12 First Look reports will not be produced during calendar year 2012 but are expected to be in preparation for anticipated release in June 2013.  See  as example of a published First Look from the 2007-08 SASS.  The restricted-use data files and documentation files will also be released in June 2013 and are in preparation during calendar year 2012.  For more details about how SASS is conducted, see NCES 2010-332, the Documentation report for the 2007-08 SASS, .

The Annual Reports Program (AR) has responsibility for three major annual reports, The Condition of Education, Digest of Education Statistics, and Projections of Education Statistics. In addition to these annual reports, AR has responsibility for a variety of other recurring and one-time analytic, indicator, and tabular reports on education statistics. In addition to publications, AR is responsible for short time-line special analyses, statistical allocation of Department of Education formula grants, content development for web products, and analytic papers. AR requires a wide range of support for all these types of products. This task requires the services of a full-time executive director to manage the work as described under the Purpose. In order to maximize efficiency, the director shall coordinate activities under this task to ensure that there is continuity in publications and duplication of work is avoided. Additionally, the task requires several task managers to manage individual activities, and a team of senior and junior level analysts and research assistants to work on individual projects. The majority of analysts in the core staff must have some programming experience. Also, the staff available for project work shall include staff with relevant experiences as noted in Sections V and VI below. The task team shall include at least one staff member responsible for ensuring compliance with NCES standards.  The staff assigned to the task shall include a core staff that is assigned 100 percent of their time to this task. In addition to management and analytic staff, this task requires regular services of computer programmers and an information specialist, with experience in the area of dissemination of statistical data through web-based systems.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



Task 9:  International Activities Program



I.  Background



The International Activities Program (IAP) within the Early Childhood, International, and Crosscutting Studies Division (ECICSD) conducts a number of international projects, including international surveys and assessments.  These include, but are not limited to, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), and various developmental projects through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Education and Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). All of the projects contribute to the NCES goals of collecting and reporting data on education in the United States and other nations, and providing valuable comparative information about U.S. educational performance in an international context.



II.  Purpose

This project supports the activities of the International Activities Program (IAP).  Work falls under three general categories: 

General management: Communication with NCES IAP staff and planning and monitoring work.

Data development: Support for data development on international surveys and assessments.

Analysis and reporting: Development and review of analyses and reports using international surveys and assessments.



III.  Scope of Work

Subtask 1a:    Post award meeting 

The contractor shall meet with the NCES project director within 1 week of award to review the work activities and refine the schedule of deliverables.  The contractor shall submit a summary of this initial meeting, including any revisions to the work plan, to the NCES program director within one week of the meeting. 

  

Subtask 1b:    Monthly reports 

The contractor shall provide reports that summarize work activities, accomplishments, problems, budgetary needs, and expenditures, as well as electronic copies of all deliverables for the month will be provided to the NCES project director. 



Task 2 -- Data Development

The contractor shall provide research and technical support for U.S. participation in PIRLS, PISA, and TIMSS, as well as OECD’s International Indicators of Education Systems (INES) program and other international program data development efforts.  This support will take the form of reviews of materials developed to plan and undertake the surveys and assessments; reviews of preliminary data files, including restricted-use files; literature reviews; maintenance of a virtual library of literature related to the surveys and assessments and the production of quarterly reports from the library; and occasional development of original instruments and other materials for planning and undertaking surveys and assessments. IAP typically requires approximately 12 reviews per year; reviews typically require the support of one senior analyst and two junior analysts. The format of reviews will be negotiated at the time of the review, but typical formats are tracked changes in text documents, mark ups of hard copies of materials, or memos (or emails) listing and describing the findings of reviews. 



Task 3 -- Analysis and Reporting

The contractor shall provide analysis and reporting support for U.S. participation in PIRLS, PISA, and TIMSS, as well as OECD’s International Indicators of Education Systems (INES) program and other international program data development efforts.  



The work of this subtask includes:

Subtask 3a:    Quick turnaround assignments

The contractor shall respond to the program director’s request for information or special analyses related to IAP’s work with various international planning teams and data collections. Activities may include data runs to answer a specific question or developing Q&As.  The contractor shall plan for up to 12 such activities. For planning purposes, the maximum time allotted for quick-turnaround analyses will be 3 full working days.

  

Subtask 3b:    Reports on which the contractor will be a primary author 

The contractor shall produce compendium reports, each typically 100 pages in length, including appendices. International program compendium reports are produced from the re-analysis of PIRLS, PISA, TIMSS, and INES data to develop indicators briefly comparing the United States and other countries on focused topics. An example is the Comparative Indicators of Education in the United States and Other G-8 Countries series of reports produced biennially by NCES (see, for example, ).

 

The contractor shall

Pick up development of one compendium (topic to be determined in the first month of the contract year) at the project officer review stage (at this stage a draft of the report, including factbook, has been completed for comment by the project officer); and

Begin work on a second compendium (topic to be determined by the end of the sixth month of the contract year), completing a draft (including factbook) for project officer review.



These activities will require revising manuscripts in response to NCES/IES editorial and technical comments. The contractor shall conduct the data analyses and write all draft documents in a form consistent with the IES style guide and NCES statistical standards.  See the following as an example of the type of NCES report the contractor shall prepare:  



The contractor shall maintain records of the technical review process for each document.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



Task 11:  Data Development Program Support 



I.  Background



As part of the Early Childhood, International, and Crosscutting Studies Division (ECICSD) at the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Data Development Program (DDP) collects survey data and produces reports on topics relevant to education policy using a variety of data gathered by NCES, the Bureau of the Census, and other federal and non-federal education data sources.  The DDP does this by collecting nationally-representative survey data on issues of topical interest to policymakers and providing information on a quick turnaround basis; by collecting statistical indicator data on state-level education reform efforts from agencies and sources outside of NCES; by analyzing data and reporting on issues of topical importance in the form of NCES Issue Briefs; and by responding to requests from inside and outside of the agency for information related to NCES data, data quality, methodological approaches, or other inquiries focused on NCES’s mission and its data. 



II.  Purpose



The purpose of this task is: (1) To support development and implementation of FRSS/PEQIS surveys by assisting the program with technical and substantive review and evaluation of reports produced for NCES by third party contractors and aiding in the development, statistical analysis, writing, and program review of new FRSS/PEQIS research reports leading to the production of final versions.  (2) Provide support for periodic updating and maintenance of data values and explanatory narrative on the State Reforms Website.  (3) Provide support for producing Issue Briefs -- short, original research reports focused on a particular topic, which are about 1,400 words in length and include around 2-3 tables and/or figures. (4) Provide support for responses to data requests on an ad hoc basis.



III. Scope of Work



Task 1 – Initial Meeting 

The contractor shall meet with the NCES task leader within one week of award to review activities and refine the task schedule. The contractor shall submit a summary of the meeting, including any revisions to the schedule, to the NCES task leader within one week of the meeting.

Monthly meetings will be required for purposes of overall coordination and management of ongoing tasks and responsibilities.   







Subtask 1a:	Post award meeting 

The contractor shall meet with the NCES task leader within one week of award to review the activities and refine the task schedule.  The Contractor shall submit a summary of the meeting, including any revisions to the schedule within one week of the meeting. 

 

Subtask 1b: 	Monthly meetings

The contractor’s management team responsible for the activities in this project shall meet with NCES on a monthly basis and provide a monthly report. 



Task 2 -- FRSS/PEQIS 

The FRSS and PEQIS surveys collect data on issues affecting elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education.  The surveys are usually conducted under a third-party data collection contract and in response to data requests by NCES, the Department of Education, and from other U.S. government offices.  FRSS/PEQIS conduct surveys of institutions, schools, teachers, and students and produce reports within a fast turnaround time.  



This task provides support for the development and implementation of FRSS/PEQIS surveys through (1) assistance to the program with technical and substantive review and evaluation of reports produced for NCES by third party contractors; and (2) support for the development, statistical analysis, writing, and program review of new research reports leading to the production of final versions of reports suitable for release on the Internet and through the Government Printing Office (GPO).  



In addition to providing assistance to the program with technical and substantive reviews in adherence to the NCES statistical standards and guidelines for publication of documents, a survey report may require changes to the analyses, text, tables, figures, or any aspect of the report based on comments of reviewers at stages prior to the final version. Additional analyses, tables or figures, as well as formatting for web release may also be required.



The contractor shall provide ongoing support for all facets of FRSS/PEQIS by performing the following tasks.



Subtask 2a:  	Oversight support

Provide oversight of the status of ongoing FRSS/PEQIS survey work and advise NCES of difficulties in meeting deadlines. This subtask includes monitoring third party contractors to assure that survey development, data collection, and reporting are completed by required deadlines. A monthly review of the status of all FRSS/PEQIS surveys will be required.



Subtask 2b:	Development

Assist in the development of surveys and reports upon request by NCES. For surveys, this may include researching past survey efforts and determining other relevant surveys for a given topic. For reports, this may include literature searches, statistical analysis, and report writing. All analysis and reports must conform to NCES statistical and style standards.







Subtask 2c:	Meeting support

Participate in and provide support for various meetings including: kickoff meetings, questionnaire and report development meetings, and FRSS/PEQIS monthly status meetings. The frequency of development meetings will be determined as needed.



Subtask 2d:	Review

Assist in the review of materials, including survey reports, developed by NCES or third party contractors. Organize materials by survey to maintain internal NCES survey documentation. Ensure consistency with NCES-established standards and procedures for survey data collection, statistical reporting and report production. NCES expects to release up to ten (10) FRSS/PEQIS survey reports annually.



Subtask 2e:	Research support 

Research current and potential FRSS/PEQIS topics and write literature reviews and executive summaries for reports upon request of NCES. This task may be completed in conjunction with third party contractor reports. NCES expects this need for up to five (5) reports annually.



Subtask 2f:	Improvement

Recommend improvements in the content, style, or usability of FRSS/PEQIS products (including reports and data files) available for download from the web. This task includes: methods of release, design of reports, contents or formatting of data files, design of FRSS and PEQIS web pages, and other related system elements.



Subtask 2g:	Outreach 

Develop content for FRSS and PEQIS web sites and respond to public inquiries regarding the FRSS/PEQIS programs. This task includes drafting and revising report descriptions, release notices and survey system summaries for web postings. The contractor will be expected to respond to public inquiries through the FRSS and PEQIS public email boxes within one to two (1 to 2) business days for basic requests and five to ten (5 to 10) business days for detailed requests involving statistical analysis or further inquiries.



Task 3 -- State Reforms 

This task provides support for periodic updating and maintenance of data values and explanatory narrative on the State Reforms Website.  In 1992, NCES issued Overview and Inventory of State Requirements for School Coursework and Attendance (NCES 92-663).  This Congressionally mandated report described major reform strategies and identified their occurrence across the states.  Since that time, states’ education reform efforts have included strategies similar to those described in the 1992 report but other strategies have been developed that were unique to the 1990s.  Also, states have chosen whether and how to implement various strategies in many different ways.  In 2003, the report was significantly updated and issued as Overview and Inventory of State Education Reforms: 1990 to 2000 (http://nces.ed.gov/programs/quarterly/vol_5/5_3/3_5.asp).  Because of the continuously changing nature of state reform activities and the desire to provide updates on an ongoing basis, after the release of the 2003 report, a website was developed to continuously update information as changes occur.  



The State Reforms website is intended to provide state-level information about states’ reform activities as specifically required in PL 107-279, Sec. 153(a)(1)(A).  These reform efforts are continually changing.  Starting from the material that was included in the 2003 report, this project is to keep the information that was produced in that report up to date by periodically updating the content of existing data tables and explanatory narrative to be posted on the state reform website.  This involves researching and updating the content of information currently available on the website or in the published report.  It also involves identifying areas of new state reform effort that merit development of new topical areas to be included in the website.  The materials included for the website are drawn from a variety of education organizations and from NCES data collections.  The website is to be used by researchers, policymakers, and members of the general public who are interested in the state context of education reform ().



During the period of performance the contractor shall produce and update the substantive content of the state reforms website. This includes the following tasks.  



Subtask 3a:	Organization contacts

Maintain current contact information for education organizations that track state education reforms. This list of organizations must include at a minimum Education Week, Council of Chief State School Officers, Education Commission of the States, and the National Governors Associations.



Subtask 3b:	Update collection

On a quarterly basis, contact each such education organization to determine whether data in publication or website tables have been updated or if new tables should be added.



Subtask 3c:	Update tables 

At a minimum, update content for existing tables for the NCES website every six months, following release of new data by education organizations. Between five and fifteen tables or indicators are expected to change in each update.  



Subtask 3d:	Preparation of new indicator tables

Prepare proposed website content for technical review and make up to four revisions of the content based on review comments. Maintain records of the technical review process for new website content.  



Subtask 3e:	Quality control 

For each new or updated table or indicator, verify the quality of data collected by education organizations. This will include documenting how individual statistics were calculated and the general survey parameters under which the data were collected.



Subtask 3f:	New Reforms

Identify and document new reform areas as needed or requested by NCES.



Subtask 3g:	New organizations

Identify and validate new education organizations as data sources with each update of website indicators.  Inform NCES of any additions made during the indicator update.



Task 4 -- Issue Briefs

This task provides support for producing short, original research reports focused on a particular topic, which are about 1,400 words in length and include around 2-3 tables and/or figures. Issue Briefs are written in a style and format accessible to audiences not trained in statistics. Because they provide wide circulation of important survey findings in a clear and concise way, Issue Briefs play an important role in NCES reporting. 



The purpose of the Issue Brief task is to maintain the capability to generate Issue Briefs and track their progress through NCES/IES review. Developing a program of Briefs using various NCES data collection programs will be required. The task will involve developing research topics and questions, analysis and reporting, and prompt responses to editorial and technical comments on drafts. For examples of past Issue Briefs see .

NAICS Code: 541720



PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



Task 12:  Support for Early Childhood and Household Studies Program		



I.  Background



This project provides support for the Early Childhood and Household Studies Program (ECHS) within the Early Childhood, International, and Crosscutting Studies Division (ECICSD).  Among other responsibilities, the Program is responsible for the design and operation of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Studies (ECLS), which includes three national cohort studiesthe Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K), and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011).  In addition, the program is responsible for a series of repeating cross sectional surveys titled the National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES). Consideration is also being made for a possible longitudinal study of children as they move from elementary school to high school.  The ECHS program also coordinates several NCES joint projects with the Census Bureau that center around the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Decennial Census, and the American Community Survey (ACS).  Census work relates to general measures of educational attainment and school enrollment.  Overall, the task will support work on longitudinal and cross sectional survey work within the ECHS program including the Census Bureau activities.    



II.  Purpose



The purpose of the contract is to provide ECHS with support across the full range of design and reporting activities associated with major data collection projects and statistical studies.  Work includes providing ECHS staff with advice study design materials, study operation reports and study operation monitoring, reporting study results, and training analysts to properly use the resulting data and other outreach activities.  The scope of work, deliverables, and schedule of deliverables are organized around these study needs.  Work will focus primarily on the ECLS-K:2011 study, the NHES:2012 studies, and Census data related work, though the contractor will be expected to be familiar with ECLS-B, ECLS-K, and previous NHES collections.  



There is a large volume of highly technical work associated with this task and the work tends to require relatively short development periods.  As such, it is imperative that staff bid by the contractor for this task have experience in education research and have experience using these data sets to generate analyses.  There will not be time after the start of the contract for contractor personnel to familiarize themselves with the content and background of the studies.  











III.   Scope of Work



III A. Management tasks



Task 1 – Weekly progress meetings

Because of the volume, disparate nature, and complexity of the work in 2012, the contractor shall meet with NCES project staff on a weekly basis.  The contractor shall use these meetings to share information about the progress of ongoing work.  The meetings will also be used to inform the contractor about upcoming work NCES anticipates regarding the tasks detailed below.  Separate meetings shall be planned for the ECLS work, and for the NHES-Census data work.  The contractor shall provide an agenda for each meeting and a written summary of each meeting. 



III B. Study development tasks



Task 2 -- Questionnaire and instrument design for the spring first grade and second grade data collections for ECLS-K:2011

The contractor shall assist NCES with finalizing questionnaires and survey instruments. Design work for ECLS-K:2011 will focus on designing and finalizing parent data collection instruments,  teacher instruments, special education teacher instruments, after-school care provider instruments, and principal instruments.  Original instruments will be developed outside of this contract.  Instruments combine the questions that are to be asked of respondents, procedures for recording the responses, and instructions for how to navigate through the questions.  The contractor shall provide professional review of related instruments developed by third party contractors.  Professional review includes substantive consideration of the utility of the items in the instruments for capturing information about child development at the outset of elementary school.  Such consideration includes consideration of the items themselves, how they relate to each other in the instrument, how they relate to previous ECLS and NHES collections, and how they relate to other collections related to child development from other well known sources.  Professional review also includes consideration of the effectiveness of the proposed instrumentation for collecting the data reflected in the items, if the instruments can be completed in time frames set aside for completion, and how seamlessly instruments interface with other instruments and databases central to the overall success of the data collection.  



Subtask 2a:    Review ECLS-K:2011 spring first grade questionnaires and instruments

The contractor shall provide professional review of ECLS-K:2011 instruments as needed over the course of 2012.  Most work for spring first grade will be completed before the start of this contract.

NAICS Code:541720



PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



Task 14:  Assessment Division Support



I.  Background

The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is required to provide, in a timely manner, a fair and accurate measurement of educational achievement in reading, mathematics, and other content areas including writing, science, history, geography, civics, economics, foreign languages and the arts. The assessments are representative of the nation, regions, and where appropriate, states at grades 4, 8, and 12. NAEP shall also report on national long term trend assessments in reading and mathematics for students at ages 9, 13, and 17. NAEP is administered by the Assessment Division (AD) within the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES).

The current schedule of assessments to be supported is presented in Exhibit A. Exhibit B shows the development and reporting activities associated with each assessment.  



II. Purpose



The support sought with this procurement requires broad knowledge of the psychometric and operations components and nuances of NAEP.  In order to accomplish its full schedule of assessments, AD requires support in two broad areas. The work in these two areas will be awarded to separate contractors who shall work together throughout the life of the contract in support of NAEP’s mission. One broad area is included in this Task 14: NAEP Statistical and Psychometric Methodology Support. This task includes five tasks: 1: Initial meeting, 2: Research, 3: Assessment Operations, 4: Reporting and 5: Project management and deliverables tracking. 



The second broad area is included in a separate task, titled NAEP Technical Support for Secondary Analysis and Coordination, Task 15. Task 15 includes six tasks: 1: Initial Meeting 2: Provide Technical Information Support for the Assessment Division, 3: Technical Coordination Support, 4: Project Coordination Support, 5: Coordination of Support among Subtasks, 6: Integration of Reporting and Operating Support. Bidders on each of these two NAEP tasks must read the Performance Work Statements for both tasks in order to fully understand the integrated nature of the required work. This Performance Work Statement requires distinct and specific skills to complete NAEP’s core work, but the core work cannot be accomplished independently of the work in the task NAEP Technical Support for Secondary Analysis and Coordination.  




Exhibit A: NAEP Schedule of Assessments



**Assessments involving test administration by computer.
NOTES:
(1) Grades tested are 4, 8, and 12 unless otherwise indicated, except that long-term trend assessments sample students at ages 9, 13, and 17 and are conducted in reading and mathematics.
(2) Subjects in BOLD ALL CAPS indicate the year in which a new framework is implemented or assessment year for which the Board will decide whether a new or updated framework is needed. 
(3) The Governing Board intends to conduct assessments at the 12th grade in World History and Foreign Language during the assessment period 2018-2022.  So, some technical support and review work may be required for these assessments from 2013-2016.

The Assessment Schedule is subject to change. The latest version is available at 




Exhibit B: NAEP Assessment Development Activities:  2012 – 2017





III.  Scope of Work

NAEP Task 14, Statistical and Psychometric Methodology Support, and NAEP Task 15, Technical Support for Secondary Analysis and Coordination (i.e., Technical Support Task 15), are both required to support the full schedule of NAEP assessments and are separate requiring their own knowledge and skills.  However, the individual tasks and related subtasks cannot be accomplished without support from the companion task. For example, a secondary analysis of extant data produced through the Technical Support Task may be required in a methodology report developed under this contract. 

While maintaining the highest level of quality of work across these two separate NAEP tasks is the primary goal of AD, it would be inefficient to build complete NAEP assessment capacity in each of the two tasks. For, example, since what we expect to report, drives the development of background and cognitive item development, the staff working on the Assessment Operations Task (3) will need to work closely with the staff working on the Reporting Subtask (4) to insure that items support the final reporting of NAEP results. Consequently, AD envisions that there will be deliberate and planned coordination of expertise and resources across the tasks and subtasks within and across these two NAEP tasks. To facilitate the coordination process, a requirement for the NAEP Statistical and Psychometric Methodology Support Task 14 is cooperation and coordination with the contractor for NAEP Technical Support Task 15. 

Independently and not as an agent of the United States Government, the Contractor shall provide all personnel, materials, services, and facilities necessary for the project and perform the tasks as described below. The work to be covered under this Statement of Work begins with the award of the contract(s) in 2012, with an option of renewing the contract(s) for each of four subsequent years.  



Task 1-- Initial Meeting 

The contractor shall meet with the NCES task leader within one week of award to review activities and refine the task schedule.  The contractor shall submit a summary of the meeting, including any revisions to the schedule, to the NCES task leader within one week of the meeting.



The contractor shall work with the Technical Support Task contractor who shall facilitate the development of a memorandum of understanding that includes a plan for coordinating activities between the two NAEP support contracts indicated in this procurement.  Each contractor shall contribute and agree to the plan, within 2 weeks after the project initiation meeting.



Task 2 -- Research

Under this task, the contractor shall conduct research studies, disseminate the results of such studies, attend research meetings, support NCES in checking the quality of research conducted by several contractors, and support NCES with analyzing existing NAEP data. 



Statistical and psychometric research studies conducted by the contractor serve several purposes:

Develop the psychometric soundness and precision of NAEP assessments: Examples of past research activities include a study exploring the construct equivalence of the NAEP reading comprehension assessment in the presence of a new item type (meaning vocabulary items). In 2012, one possible psychometric study is the determination of whether there are mode effects for 4th grade writing on paper compared with computer based writing, and the relationship between 4th grade writing on paper and 4th grade writing on computer as defined by the new computer-based writing framework. 

Adapt NAEP assessments to changing situations and different populations: For example, in 2009, three studies examined factors that might have presented challenges in NAEP’s 2007 Puerto Rico mathematics assessment. These studies were designed to improve the 2011 Puerto Rico mathematics assessment.  In 2012 NCES will require technical memoranda comparing the bridging and statistical moderation methodologies for linking performance in Puerto Rico and the mainland. 

Enhance understanding of NAEP results: For example, in 2009, a statistical link was established between the NAEP and the ECLS-K grade 8 reading assessments. Linking NAEP to a longitudinal assessment will help explain how past performance in reading assessments are related to performance on NAEP’s grade 8 reading assessment. 

Explore new ways of modeling NAEP data: An example is the research conducted by Murray and Irit Aitkin in 2009 focused on the development of a new IRT model for NAEP that treats student engagement as a parameter. Their model identifies the characteristics of students who are engaged, and who are not engaged.  This work will continue in 2012, as the program gears up for preparedness research and understanding the impact of motivation on NAEP performance.

 

In order to make studies conducted by the contractor accessible to the research community and to enhance its own studies, the contractor shall participate in research conferences. NCES also provides data training for the larger research community, primarily at research conferences. The contractor shall support NCES in preparing and conducting such training sessions. The contractor shall attend NAEP-related research meetings and conferences in order to facilitate the exchange of knowledge within and outside the NAEP research community.

 

NCES requires other NAEP contractors to conduct innovative psychometric and statistical studies such as the NAEP State Mapping Study. The contractor shall support NCES in making sure that such studies are conducted  in accordance with statistical standards, are of  high-quality and yet accessible to the larger research community. In addition, the contractor shall support NCES in analyzing existing NAEP data in response to special investigations. Because of the complex nature of NAEP data, such analysis requires a deep understanding of how NAEP assessments are conducted and how NAEP data are scaled.

 

Under this task, the contractor shall provide statistical and psychometric expertise to assist NCES in the planning and quality control of NAEP research activities described in Subtasks 2.a - 2.e and to provide statistical and psychometric support to tasks 3 and 4 and to the Technical support Task contractor.

 

Subtask 2.a:   Conduct Statistical, Psychometric, or Operational Studies

The contractor shall conduct up to eight studies (four per year) on emerging NAEP issues to assess the value of potential changes in the technical design of NAEP, and the analysis of NAEP data. In order to accomplish this goal, the contractor shall:

 

Develop research proposals in line with NAEP’s overall research goals.

Prepare and submit study plans as requested.

Conduct approved research activities including the preparation of data collection materials, preparation of OMB and IRB packages where applicable, and preparation of interim presentation and briefings.

Prepare study reports to be approved by the Task Leader.

Respond to feedback and prepare a final study report.

 

Below is a list of potential areas of research studies to be conducted in 2012 and 2013 (priorities for these studies will be discussed at contract kickoff meeting):



Studies that make use of latent class structures, person-fit indices, and other IRT-based procedures to examine student motivation and engagement in test taking.

Studies that examine components of item and task difficulty in NAEP assessments that identify construct-relevant and irrelevant sources of variation in science assessments.  The results of such studies would be used to develop items that appropriately target students at the extremes of the ability distribution and enhance precision.

Investigation of how item and passage characteristics impact item difficulty in NAEP’s reading assessments in support of the development of accessible reading items.

Analysis of the merits of various effect size measures for NAEP including evaluation of individual student growth benchmarks as a basis for gauging magnitude of cross-group and cross-year differences.

A Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) approach to scaling NAEP data to aid in development of diagnostic information and to determine if delivery mode (computer vs. printed test) makes a difference in the construct(s) being measured. 

Investigation of how measurements of knowledge and skills might be enhanced in NAEP’s computer-based assessments in order to provide more precise scores and diagnostic information on student performance.

Secondary analyses of the 2009 High School Transcript data; for example, how population group differences in access to challenging mathematics or science courses relate to performance on NAEP math and science assessments.

 

For each approved study, NCES shall request a study or work plan.  The complexity and profile of the proposed study will determine the level of detail necessary for the study plan.  The contractor shall deliver the study plan within fifteen calendar days of the request.  The Task Leader will approve the study plan within fifteen calendar days of receipt of the final draft plan from the contractor.  The contractor shall submit final reports on a schedule determined with the NCES.  

  

Subtask 2.b:   Facilitate exchange of NAEP knowledge among major NAEP stakeholders, in research-focused meetings and panels.

Under this task the contractor shall attend up to 12 meetings per year: 

 1.  As requested by the COR, attend research focused NAEP-related meetings such as the Design and Analysis Committee (DAC) and take notes on technical discussions for later review.

2.   Attend and present NAEP research findings on behalf of NCES or with NCES staff at key research conferences approved by the COR. Conferences include the American Education Research Association/National Council on Measurement in Education and the National Conference on Student Assessment.

3.   Provide or support NAEP data training at such research conferences as requested.

 

After attending these meetings, the contractor shall summarize relevant technical issues pertinent to the work of Subtask 2b.  In consultation with NCES, the contractor shall identify staff to attend these meetings.  Potential meetings include: (DAC) Design and Analysis Committee (4/year in Washington, DC), (NVS) NAEP Validity Studies Panel (4/year in Washington, DC), and (NAGB) National Assessment Governing Board (4/year, 2 in Washington, DC). 



If needed, the contractor shall coordinate with the Technical support Task contractor for technical support. 

  

Subtask 2.c:  Research Dissemination and Management Support

The contractor shall develop and manage a program area for coordination, summarization, and dissemination of NAEP research and development efforts.  Activities include:

Task Order Number: 16-2012 

Task Order Title:  NCES Expert Help Task

Task Order Type:  Firm Fixed Price/Level of Effort

Category A:  Open Competition

NAICS Code: 541720



PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT 



Task 16:  NCES Expert Help Task



I.  Background 



The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is charged with the acquisition, analysis, interpretation, dissemination, and reporting of statistical data reflecting the condition and progress of education at all levels in the United States and on educational activities and student achievement compared with foreign nations. It serves as the principal federal source of education statistics obtained from educational institutions, individuals, practitioners, state and local agencies, and other federal agencies (). Certain statistical data obtained by the Center are used for the purpose of allocating formula-grant federal assistance funds to state and local education and library agencies. Other statistical data released by the Center are extensively used in policy analyses and support a number of significant research efforts.  As a part of its mandate, NCES must study and develop solutions to new problems and issues that arise in the collection and analysis of education data.  





 II. Purpose

To be able to respond quickly to requirements that involve studying and developing solutions to new problems and issues as they arise, NCES must have a task in place that will allow ready access to a wide array of senior statisticians, senior survey methodologists, and senior subject matter experts with expertise across the full range of modes of data collection; survey sampling methods, and related weighting and complex variance estimation; eliciting responses from different types of respondents, analytic approaches to the analysis of education data; and topics covered in the NCES portfolio of data collections—from preschool education to adult education. 

Although the day-to-day work on this wide array of topics may be included in individual Performance Work Statements (PWS), NCES anticipates, from decades of experience, that unforeseen problems will emerge—some specifically related to existing work, and some related to work not specifically included in the current set of PWS.  Furthermore, NCES anticipates that there will be instances in which new areas of work emerge in which it is in the best interest of the government to initiate a relatively small exploratory task to inform the potential development of a possible PWS in a new area of work. While NCES anticipates the potential for Expert Help assistance across a range of unforeseen activities, one immediate topic that is emerging concerns the analysis of the rich longitudinal data that individual states are developing in their statewide longitudinal data systems (SLDS).





III.  Scope of Work



Task 1 -- Initial Meeting 

The contractor shall meet with the NCES task leader within one week of award to review activities and refine the task schedule.  The contractor shall submit a summary of the meeting, including any revisions to the schedule, to the NCES task leader within one week of the meeting.

	

Task 2 – SLDS Analytic Agenda

The development of the statewide longitudinal data systems is being supported by funds provided through the Institute for Education Sciences (IES), the American Recovery and Recovery Act (ARRA), and the Race to the Top (RTT) program; NCES has major responsibility for monitoring the grants under which these funds have been provided. To date much of the attention in this arena has focused on developing the framework and infrastructure for these data systems, with less attention focused on the potential uses of these data rich information systems. 



NCES’ technical assistance responsibilities also include promulgating appropriate uses of the resulting data. To this end, NCES must develop a research and analysis agenda that will identify an array of potential uses of these data and develop exemplar analyses for a range of these uses.  NCES is in need of assistance with the development of this agenda, the identification of specific analyses and the analytic approaches to be used with each.  This agenda should delineate the full range of uses, and should identify a subset of analyses that are sufficient to provide exemplars of a wide range of analytic techniques that can be used to explore these data. 



The contractor shall provide support from a senior level statistical professional with nationally recognized statistical and methodological expertise in the analysis of education data, including longitudinal data and the analysis and use of state data for individual students.



Task 3 – Additional Expert Help Work

The contractor shall assist NCES in addressing specific problems and issues as they arise, NCES must have a task in place that will allow ready access to a wide array of senior statisticians, senior survey methodologists, and senior subject matter experts with expertise across the full range of modes of data collection; survey sampling methods, and related weighting and complex variance estimation; eliciting responses from different types of respondents, analytic approaches to the analysis of education data; and topics covered in the NCES portfolio of data collections—from preschool education to adult education. 

NCES anticipates that unforeseen methodological and substantive problems will emerge from the NCES portfolio of data collections—some specifically related to existing work, and some related to work not specifically included in the current set of PWS.  Furthermore, NCES anticipates that there will be instances in which new areas of work emerge in which it is in the best interest of the government to initiate a relatively small exploratory task to inform the potential development of a possible PWS in a new area of work.

The contractor shall provide support, when a specific task(s) is identified senior level staff with the appropriate skill set.  His may include, but is not limited to, senior statisticians, senior survey methodologists, and senior subject matter experts with expertise across the full range of modes of data collection; survey sampling methods, and related weighting and complex variance estimation; eliciting responses from different types of respondents, analytic approaches to the analysis of education data; and topics covered in the NCES portfolio of data collections—from preschool education to adult education. 



IV.  Period of Performance



The Contractor shall complete all activities from the time of award, January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012. This PWS will be awarded for a 12 month base period with annual options for years two through five (2-5) of the contract, if exercised.



V.  Assumptions

SSP takes the lead in developing and maintaining the statistical and survey methodology standards that ensure the quality of statistical surveys, analyses and products (); consults and advises on the implementation of standards for all NCES projects; conducts internal technical reviews for all NCES publications and products (see the NCES electronic publication catalog at  for examples of existing NCES publications and products); and coordinates the revision of the NCES Statistical Standards. SSP also monitors and administers confidentiality procedures (see  for information on the NCES confidentiality program) and related restricted-use data licenses (see  for information on the licensing process) for NCES data products. In addition, SSP consults and advises on emerging statistical issues and initiates, monitors or participates in long-term statistical and methodological research projects.



II. Purpose



SSP is charged with center wide responsibilities for developing and maintaining NCES Statistical Standards; for the technical and statistical review of NCES products, and for monitoring the use of the statistical standards and related guidelines as part of a quality control effort. SSP also maintains the NCES Handbook of Survey Methods, monitors the use of NCES data, and conducts special quick-turnaround research and analytic projects as the need arises. SSP also has center wide responsibilities for data privacy and data confidentiality; including providing substantive and administrative leadership to the IES/NCES Disclosure Review Board, developing and supporting the IES/NCES external user restricted use data licensing system, and supporting the NCES role in the initiation and first stage clearance of NCES contractors’ security clearance process. SSP requires technical and statistical support to fulfill its responsibilities in these areas. 



III.  Scope of Work



Task 1 – Initial Meeting 

The contractor shall meet with the NCES task leader within one week of award to review activities and refine the task schedule.  The contractor shall submit a summary of the meeting, including any revisions to the schedule, to the NCES task leader within one week of the meeting.

		

Task 2 --  Technical and Statistical Support

The contractor shall support SSP in its work developing, maintaining, and monitoring statistical, methodological, and quality standards and providing NCES staff statistical support. While the highest priority task activity shall be support for NCES internal technical reviews, related subtasks also include Quality Control, Monitoring the Use of NCES Data, and Statistical Research Projects. The skills needed for these tasks are interrelated. Due to the uneven flow of NCES products that require timely technical review, the use of the same staff for this set of technical statistical tasks will ensure a sufficient number of staff for periods when timely, high quality technical reviews are required for a large number of products, while at the same time drawing on the in-depth knowledge of the NCES Statistical Standards and the broad understanding of NCES programs on the part of skilled technical reviewers for the quality control and statistical research projects.

Subtask 2.a:    Initial Technical Review of NCES Products

Thorough in-depth review of each NCES report and data product is a cornerstone of quality control in all NCES products. The Statistical Standards Program has the responsibility for providing detailed technical reviews of all NCES products (reports, data files, file documentation, and web sites); these technical reviews must ensure that statistical standards and guidelines are met in each NCES product. NCES reports and tables that present data or describe and present analyses of data will go through a multidimensional review; multiple reviewers at NCES and from the contractor shall be assigned specific elements of each product to review simultaneously. 

Specifically, the basic elements of each product will be examined by statistical research assistant level contractor staff. These basic elements include, for example, checking for consistency in the data throughout a report; checking for significance tests that support comparisons made in a report based on sample data; checking that the data cited in the testing documentation agree with the data included in the report; checking the tables against the NCES Guidelines for Tabular Presentations (); checking figures against the NCES Statistical Standard () and checking the reports presentation for compliance with the NCES Style Guide ().  These basic elements are described in detail in the attached form titled “Reviewing NCES Reports—Statistical Research Assistants.” (Attachment 1-2012-A)

At the same time, more analytic elements of each product will be examined by the contractor’s task leader, senior analysts, and midlevel analysts. These analytic elements include, for example, ensuring that the required information needed to set up a report is included in the introductory materials of the report; reviewing the content in the body of the report, especially the presentation of statistical findings, for clarity; ensuring that the statistical analysis and related significance tests are appropriate for, and consistent with, the findings and conclusions reported; examining tables and figures for clarity in presentation; and confirming the inclusion of required components of survey design in the technical notes of the report. These analytic elements are described in detail in the attached form “Reviewing NCES Reports—Technical Reviewers.” (Attachment 1-2012-B)

The contractor shall complete each initial review within the time period specified for individual report types. These initial reviews shall be submitted to the assigned NCES review leader and the Chief Statistician in the prescribed format using the NCES Review Template. (Attachment 1-2012-C)

 (In the case of the Condition of Education, the reviewer comments shall be entered into the electronic data base provided by the Condition of Education team.) The reviews should each cover the content and topics identified for the specific type of report in the Reviewing NCES Reports spreadsheets. (Attachments 1-2012-A and 2-2012-B)

In addition to the specific types of NCES reports described in the following subtasks, NCES produces several comprehensive resource publications (compendia) that summarize major education statistics on the status and progress of education at one or more levels of education from preprimary through graduate education, adult education, and lifelong learning. Annual reports in this category include the Digest of Education Statistics, The Condition of Education, Crime Indicators, and Projections. The estimated volume of work expected for these reports is incorporated in the subtasks for the report types specified in the subtasks per the following descriptions.

For this task, the Projections report and any other compendia reports that are a mix of tables, figures, and text will be treated as either a First Look Report, a Statistics in Brief, or a Statistical Analysis Report, depending on the size of the report under review.

For this task, the Digest of Education Statistics will be treated as multiple table submissions, with the accompanying introductory text, chapter introductions, and technical appendix text treated collectively as one or more First Look Report, a Statistics in Brief, or a Statistical Analysis Report, depending on the number of text pages.

For this task, the Condition of Education, and other compendia based on an indicator format, will be treated as a set of Issue Briefs, with the introductory text, chapter introductions, and technical appendix text treated as one or more First Look Report, a Statistics in Brief, or a Statistical Analysis Report, depending on the number of text pages.

Subtask 2.a.1: Tables - Each initial review of a table set shall be submitted to NCES within 10 working days from the transmittal to the contractor. Tables shall be processed in groups of 10 (i.e., a review of a set of 60 tables equals six (6) deliverables).  In the most recently completed calendar year, NCES reviewed the equivalent of 240 table sets of 10 tables per set. NCES anticipates having up to 230 table sets for review in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each table set shall require approximately one and one half (1.5) hours of the task leader or a senior analyst’s time, one and one half (1.5) hours of a mid level analyst’s time, and two and one third (2.3) hours of a statistical research assistant’s time.  

Subtask 2.a.2: First Look Reports - Each initial review of a First Look Report shall be submitted to NCES within three (3) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. A First Look Report includes a brief introduction [one to three (1-3) pages], one (1) page of findings, up to 15 pages of tables, and necessary technical notes. These reports average 46 pages in length. In the most recently completed calendar year, NCES reviewed the equivalent of 26 First Look Reports. NCES anticipates having up to 30 reports of this type for review in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of a First Look Report shall require 15 hours of the task leader, a senior analyst or a mid level analyst’s time (with the one half of the assignments going to the task leader or senior analyst and one half going to a mid level analyst), and five and one half hours (5.5) of time from each of two (2) statistical research assistants. 

Subtask 2.a.3: Statistics in Brief - Each initial review of a Statistics in Brief Report shall be submitted to NCES within 10 working days from the transmittal to the contractor. These reports are based on short, focused analyses of specific topics. Statistics in Brief reports are designed to provide data on policy-relevant topics; they include a mix of tables, figures, and text. These reports average 20 pages in length. In the most recently completed calendar year, NCES reviewed the equivalent of 23 Statistics in Brief reports. NCES anticipates having up to 30 reports of this type for review in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of a Statistics in Brief Report shall require seven (7) hours of the task leader, a senior analyst or a mid level analyst’s time (with the one half of the assignments going to the task leader or senior analyst and one half going to a mid level analyst), and five (5) hours of time from a statistical research assistant. 

Subtask 2.a.4: Analytic Reports - Each initial review of an analytic report shall be submitted to NCES within 13 working days from the transmittal to the contractor. This report type includes Statistical Analysis Reports that present an overview of results from one survey, or from one topic based on analysis across several surveys. The data and findings are presented with commentary to identify substantively and statistically significant results, and their relationship to educational research; they include a mix of tables, figures, and text. This report type also includes Research and Development (R&D) Reports that are detailed reports of emerging issues, state-of-the-art analytic approaches, and new software applications. The findings reported in developmental work are subject to revision as the work continues and additional data become available. These reports average 88 pages in length. In the most recently completed calendar year, NCES reviewed the equivalent of 18 Analytic Reports. NCES anticipates having up to 19 reports of this type for review in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each Statistical Analysis Report shall require approximately 19 hours of the task leader or a senior analyst’s time, 19 hours of a mid level analyst’s time, and 28 hours of a statistical research assistant’s time.  

Subtask 2.a.5:  Issue Briefs - Each initial review of an Issue Brief shall be submitted to NCES within five (5) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. These reports are a two-to-four (2-4) page summary of a particular topic. A limited number of tables and charts are presented with descriptive text intended to provide a quick view of a current topic. In the most recently completed calendar year NCES reviewed the equivalent of 100 Issue Brief Reports. NCES anticipates having up to 134 reports of this type for review in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each Issue Brief shall require approximately two (2) hours of the task leader, a senior analyst, or a mid level analyst’s time and two (2) hours of a statistical research assistant’s time.  



Subtask 2.a.6:   Web pages - Each initial review of a set of web pages shall be submitted to NCES within five (5) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. Web pages shall be processed in groups of 10. In most recently completed calendar year, NCES reviewed the equivalent of 31 web page sets of 10 web pages per set. NCES anticipates having up to 38 web page sets for review in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each set of web pages shall require approximately two and one half (2.5) hours of the task leader, a senior analyst, or a mid level analyst’s time and two (2) hours of a statistical research assistant’s time.  



Subtask 2.b:    Compliance Technical Review of NCES Products

In the NCES review process, after all reviewer comments are submitted to the author, the author prepares a response memo that includes a reply to each comment with either a proposed change or an explanation as to why no change is proposed.  The NCES Technical Review leader for the specific report reviews the author’s responses and provides comments back to the author. The author then executes the proposed changes and subsequently submits the revised draft, with an updated NCES Review Template that specifies the location and the exact nature of each change. 

This revised draft report and the revised reviewer template will be transmitted from SSP to the contractor. The contractor shall conduct a compliance review to ensure that all agreed upon changes were successfully implemented. NCES anticipates that the level of effort involved in these compliance reviews will in general be less that that required for an initial review. NCES also anticipates that the number of reviews and the level of effort with subsequent rounds of compliance review will decrease. Each compliance review shall be completed within the time period specified for individual report types. The contractor review comments shall be submitted to NCES embedded in the author’s revised NCES Review Template. Virtually all reports and products submitted to ESSI for review shall be submitted again for the first round compliance review. NCES anticipates that when needed, the level of effort required for a second round of compliance review will be substantially reduced relative to the first round compliance review for most report types.

Subtask 2.b.1:  Tables - Each compliance review of a table set shall be submitted to NCES within five (5) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. NCES anticipates having up to 230 such products. Second round compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the compliance review of a set of tables shall require one (1) hours of the task leader, a senior analyst or a mid level analyst’s time (with the one half of the assignments going to the task leader or senior analyst and one half going to a mid level analyst), and one (1) hours of time from a statistical research assistant. 

Subtask 2.b.2:   First Look Reports - Each compliance review of a First Look Report shall be submitted to NCES within three (3) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. These reports average 46 pages in length. NCES anticipates having up to 30 such products. Second compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the compliance review of First Look reports shall require approximately four (4) hours of the task leader or a senior analyst’s time, four (4) hours of a mid level analyst’s time, and six (6) hours of a statistical research assistant’s time.  

Subtask 2.b.3:   Statistics in Brief - Each compliance review of a Statistics in Brief Report shall be submitted to NCES within five (5) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. These reports average 20 pages in length. NCES anticipates having up to 30 such products. Second compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the compliance review of a Statistics in Brief Report shall require approximately six (6) hours of the task leader, a senior analyst or a mid level analyst’s time (with the one half of the assignments going to the task leader or senior analyst and one half going to a mid level analyst), and four (4) hours of time from a statistical research assistant. 

Subtask 2.b.4:   Statistical Analysis Reports - Each compliance review of a Statistical Analysis Report shall be submitted to NCES within 10 working days from the transmittal to the contractor. These reports average 88 pages in length. NCES anticipates having up to 18 such products. Given the complexity of this type of report, NCES expects the first compliance review to be somewhat involved, requiring as much as one-half the level of effort involved in the initial review. Second compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the compliance review of each Statistical Analysis Report shall require approximately 14 hours of the task leader or a senior analyst’s time, 14 hours of a mid level analyst’s time, and 22 hours of a statistical research assistant’s time.  

Subtask 2.b.5:   Issue Briefs - Each compliance review of an Issue Brief shall be submitted to NCES within five (5) working days from the transmittal to the contractor (3 in the case of the Condition of Education). NCES anticipates having up to 116 such products. Given the complexity and brevity of this type of report, NCES expects the first compliance review to be somewhat involved, requiring almost as much level of effort as that involved in the initial review. Second compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each Issue Brief shall require approximately two (2) hours of the task leader, a senior analyst, or a mid level analyst’s time and two (2) hours of a statistical research assistant’s time. 

Subtask 2.b.6:   Web pages - Each compliance review of a set of web pages shall be submitted to NCES within three (3) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. NCES anticipates having up to 28 such products. Second compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each set of web pages shall require approximately two and one half (2.5) hours of the task leader, a senior analyst, or a mid level analyst’s time and two (2) hours of a statistical research assistant’s time. 



Subtask2c: 	   Data Quality

The contractor shall support SSP efforts focused on monitoring specific aspects of data quality in NCES data collections. This includes the periodic updating of the center-wide report “NCES Handbook of Survey Methods” . This report was first published in 2003, and an updated version will be published before work begins under this contract.



Subtask 2.c.1:   Monitoring Data Quality - The contractor shall maintain a data base that is used for ongoing tracking of unit and item response rates; the use incentives; the analysis of nonresponse bias; the use and types of imputations; and the timeliness of various elements of data collection, data release, and reporting. NCES anticipates adding information on data quality drawn from the NCES Office of Management and the Budget (OMB) clearance packages for NCES data collections over the most recent five (5) year period. The primary emphasis of this effort is to improve our understanding of the use and wording of informed consent and confidentiality pledges across documents within single data collections and across data collections within NCES. There is also an interest in increasing our understandings of the content of the OMB pass back, with the goal of identifying recurring and emerging themes that NCES needs to address prior to submitting clearance packages. Finally this effort, will inform the ongoing monitoring of the use of incentives, including information on field experiments that are used to test alternate incentive scenarios. This work is done through extracting key information from the technical notes of initial release reports, related survey documentation and methodology reports, and OMB clearance packages. The contractor shall provide monthly updates to the data quality data base. NCES expects that the statistical research projects will require the assistance of up to two tenths (0.2) of an FTE of senior staff, approximately one-third (0.3) of an FTE of a midlevel analyst’s time, and approximately one-third (0.3) an FTE of a statistical research assistant.   



Subtask 2.c.2:   Updating the NCES Handbook of Survey Methods—The contractor shall support the ongoing revision of the center-wide report “NCES Handbook of Survey Methods” . This publication presents explanations of how each survey program in NCES obtains and prepares the data it publishes. The Handbook aims to provide users of NCES data with the information necessary to evaluate the suitability of the statistics for their needs, with a focus on the methodologies for survey design, data collection, and data processing. Each chapter focuses on a different survey system and covers a discussion of the uses of the data; key concepts measured in the survey; the design of the survey; the survey data quality and comparability with other data sources; and identifies recent methodology and evaluation reports for the survey system. Ongoing plans for this document include continuous updating of materials on recurring surveys with each new survey administration, and the addition of new chapters as new data collections are initiated.  



The contractor shall collect the information from published technical notes, survey documentation, and methodology reports; project web sites; and from NCES Project Officers responsible for individual data collections. NCES Statistical Standards related to response rates, imputations, and the general administration of surveys can be found in the NCES Statistical Standards.  Additional historical information on the methodologies of individual NCES data collection systems can be found at . 



In 2012, NCES anticipates assigning one (1) chapter on an entirely new study. NCES also anticipates assigning up to eight (8) updates of existing chapters (to include information on the most recent administration of ongoing surveys). The study to be summarized in the new chapter and the eight (8) chapters to be updated will be identified at the time of the kick-off meeting. The contractor shall submit a chapter on the new study on or before August 31, 2011. Developing this chapter for publication is expected to take approximately one (1) month of a senior analyst’s time. The contractor shall submit the updates for up to eight (8) existing chapters in the Handbook of NCES Survey Methods (to include information of the most recent administration of ongoing surveys) at a rate of one (1) every month with completion on or before October. Each update is expected to take one to one and one half (1-1.5) weeks of a statistical research assistant’s time and one (1) week of a mid level analysts time, with supervision and review from the task leader.



Subtask 2d:       Monitoring the Use of NCES Data  

The contractor shall support SSP monitoring efforts concerning the use of NCES data and related products. To improve NCES’ understanding of the use of NCES data and related products, SSP supports an ongoing effort to monitor uses of and/or citations of NCES data products as observed or reported on Education Association websites, in education professional journals, and in the Congressional Record and/or proposed and/or enacted legislation. This information collected shall be maintained by the contractor in an electronic database that supports the searchable retrieval of reports of usage by topic, data collection and/or identity of source of use.



The contractor shall provide monthly reports summarizing the contents of the electronic database. In addition, the contractor shall produce up to ten (10) tailored reports per special requests from SSP.   NCES expects the quarterly updates to the use of NCES surveys data base and related reporting to take the equivalent of six (6) weeks of a Statistical Research Assistant’s time and approximately one (1) week of the Task Leader’s time each quarter, and expects each tailored report to take approximately four (4) hours to produce. 



Subtask 2e:       Statistical Research Projects 

The contractor shall support SSP special analytic projects that require statistical expertise or in-depth knowledge of privacy, data confidentiality, and disclosure avoidance techniques as identified by the NCES Chief Statistician, the Commissioner of NCES, the Director of IES, or the Secretary of the Department of Education. Examples of projects of this type include the two volume 2006 report requested by the Secretary,  and ; and more recently the 2010 privacy and data confidentiality Technical Briefs developed for the Statewide Longitudinal Data System Grant Program at the request of the Statistical Policy Office of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Acting Commissioner of NCES, and . 



The contractor shall also support SSP reviews of the use of a particular dimension of data quality or more generally data collection practices, either within NCES, or across the Department and/or other statistical agencies. For example, NCES, with the support of contractor technical reviewers, participated in an interagency project within the federal statistical community to examine the use of informed consent and secondary usage of combined administrative and statistical data for statistical purposes. In another project, SSP, with the support of contractor technical reviewers, explored the feasibility of using a private vendor’s data files to monitor the employment patterns of principals from one year to the next. NCES has also been called upon by the Department to conduct analyses of alternative graduation rates, access to science technology and mathematics education, and disclosure protections employed by state education offices. Contractor technical review staff members assisted SSP in each of these endeavors. The skills needed for these statistical research projects will draw on the in-depth knowledge of the NCES Statistical Standards and the broad understanding of NCES programs that come from responsibilities for producing skilled technical reviews, for monitoring various aspects of data quality, and from supporting statistical research projects.



In addition to yet to be identified special projects, the contractor shall support SSP in its work on an interagency project specifying and defining elements of paradata and metadata across federal statistical surveys. The contractor shall provide monthly reports summarizing their work on the paradata and metadata project.  For special research products, the contractor shall produce analyses (tables and figures), analytic datasets, and written drafts of reports on special topics for at least two (2) topics. The reports will meet the requirements in the NCES Statistical Standards, NCES Tabular Guidelines, and NCES Style Guide.  Once each final report is submitted, it should require no more than two (2) more rounds of reviews/corrections to be considered delivered in a timely manner. 

NCES expects that the statistical research projects will require the assistance of up to two-thirds (0.67) of an FTE of senior staff, one-third (0.3) of an FTE of a midlevel analyst’s time, the equivalent of up to three-quarters (0.75) of an FTE of a statistical research assistant, five (5) weeks of an editorial support, and up to six-tenths (0.6) of an FTE of undergraduate-level statistical research assistants.  



Task 3 -- Confidentiality

The contractor shall support SSP in its work to ensure the confidentiality of NCES (and IES) data. NCES is required by law to develop and enforce standards designed to protect the personally identifiable information of its respondents (see  and  for 

relevant laws). This requirement includes protecting the information during the collection, analysis, reporting, and publication of the data. The Statistical Standards Program has three major functions in the area of information protection. The contractor shall support SSP in its work in each of these three areas—Disclosure Review Board, restricted use data licensing program, and the submission of NCES contractor employee security clearance applications.

These activities include consultation with members of the IES Disclosure Review Board (DRB), the development of software and related documentation for disclosure protection procedures, support for the review of licensee products for potential disclosures, support for the NCES Restricted-Use Data Licensing System, and support for monitoring security clearance documentation and confidentiality affidavits from contractors collecting data for NCES.



Subtask 3a:       Support for the Disclosure Review Board 

The contractor may be asked to support specific aspects of the work of the IES Disclosure Review Board (DRB). SSP coordinates and supports the activities of the Disclosure Review Board (DRB). The DRB reviews disclosure risk analyses conducted by IES and NCES staff and contractors to ensure that data released do not disclose the identity of any individual respondent (see standards 4-2-6 through 4-2-10 in ). The DRB approves the procedures implemented to anonymize the data that are released in public-use files. The DRB also approves the procedures used to remove direct identifiers from restricted-use data files. In the case of nationally representative sample surveys, the DRB also approves the procedures used to add perturbations to the data as a method of data protection. In the event of a suspected confidentiality breach, the DRB analyzes the risk of harm to respondents. 



Although the bulk of the day-to-day work of the DRB is done by federal employees, the following tasks will likely need to be undertaken by a qualified contractor to corroborate the findings of the DRB: 1) an independent evaluation of complex disclosure avoidance plans, and 2) an independent evaluation of the potential for disclosures in information products or data breaches. NCES may also require assistance in developing and maintaining the government owned software that supports the statistical application and analysis of the implementation of disclosure limitation methods for protecting data.



The contractor shall provide senior statistical staff with analytic experience in the area of disclosure risk avoidance to provide support to the NCES DRB—including conducting an independent review of disclosure risk avoidance plans, procedures, and resulting data files submitted to the DRB for clearance. There may also be a need for an independent evaluation of the potential for disclosures in information products or data breaches. This work will be consistent with the requirements in the NCES Statistical Standard for data confidentiality . The contractor shall conduct up to four reviews of submissions to the NCES DRB over the course of the year.  The reviews shall be completed within 15 working days or less after the contractor receives the publication.  The review and feedback provided must follow NCES Statistical Standards. NCES expects that these reviews will require up to five (5) weeks of a Senior Statistical Disclosure Expert’s time.



Subtask 3b:       Support for the Restricted-Use Data License Program

The contractor shall support the restricted use data-license program. The licensing program provides external researchers access to individually identifiable IES and NCES data that are protected under Federal statutes and regulations by subjecting authorized researchers to the laws, regulations, and penalties that apply to use of confidential data held by IES (see 

). 

NCES maintains an electronic data licensing system that allows qualified researchers to apply for and get access to confidential data maintained by IES and NCES (see 

 and ). Since these confidential data are protected by strict confidentiality laws that carry a class E Felony penalty for violations, it is important that the licensing system is maintained with a high degree of accuracy.  Also since many of these researchers depend upon access to these data for research that is crucial to their careers, it is also important that the licensing system be run efficiently, with timely responses to data requesters.



The day-to-day monitoring and processing of the IES restricted-use data licensing system shall be done on site by a full-time Data Security Assistant (eligibility for a 6C security clearance is a requirement). The required work involves monitoring and processing the license requests that are produced through an electronic license system; responding to user requests for assistance; logging and filing the legal documents required to execute or amend a license; making minor corrections to the license system database; producing encrypted CD-ROMs of requested data; sending final approval of new licenses to successful applicants; shipping data to approved licensees; reviewing site inspection reports for adherence to security procedures; notifying licensees of an expired license; and finalizing the closing of licenses. NCES anticipates that the work supporting the licensing system will start April 15, 2012 and shall require the full-time attention of one Data Security Assistant’s time. 

Under the license agreement, authorized researchers agree to submit their work products that use licensed IES and NCES data to NCES for disclosure avoidance review. The Data Security Assistant shall also assist with disclosure avoidance reviews of the licensees’ work products. In addition to the Data Security Assistant, a research associate and a statistical research assistant shall each spend approximately one-quarter of their time assisting with reviews of licensees work products. The contractor shall submit monthly reports summarizing the status of licensing activities and listing the disclosure avoidance reviews conducted.



Subtask 3c:       Support for Monitoring Contactor Security Clearance Documentation       (e-QIP)

The contractor shall provide support for the processing of contractor security clearance applications. The Department of Education has an established policy on personnel security screening for all contractor and subcontractor employees and their field staff. The requirements for these submissions are described in The Department of Education’s Departmental Directive OM:5-101 “Contractor Employee Personnel Security Screenings” and are required in the operationalization of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Title III of the E-Government Act (Public Law 107-347) Executive Order 13467, Reforming Processes Related to Suitability, Fitness for Contractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, July 17, 2008. Personnel security screenings are commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm the individual could cause to the Department. The Department of Education participates in the OPM e-QIP system to facilitate the security clearance process for contractor employees. The application initiation, review, and submission processes are time sensitive and require a high level of attention to detail, combined with efficient processing.

 

A full-time Data Security Associate shall work onsite with the NCES team responsible for the day-to-day monitoring and processing of the mandatory contractor employee security screening clearance applications. The required work involves initiating e-QIP accounts for contractor employees, reviewing the electronic e-qip submissions, reviewing the completed application packages, transmitting completed application packages to the Department of Education Chief of Personnel Security, monitoring the progress of the clearance for each contractor employee, receiving, logging and transmitting final clearance forms to NCES staff serving as Contracting Officer Representatives. This also involves maintaining internal electronic records of these transactions. The position requires eligibility for a 5C security clearance. NCES anticipates that the work supporting the contractor security applications will start April 15, 2012 and shall require the full-time attention of one (1) Data Security Associate’s time.  The contractor shall submit monthly reports summarizing the regular activities of the application processing system, including the number of applications initiated, reviewed, and processed. 











IV.  Period of Performance



The Contractor shall complete all activities from the time of award, January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012. This PWS will be awarded for a 12 month base period with annual options for years two through five (2-5) of the contract, if exercised.



V.  Assumptions



The Government estimates that the level of effort required to undertake the tasks described in this Performance Work Statement is approximately 9.2 person years (1 person year equals 1 FTE or 2,080 hours).



Task 2 --  Technical and Statistical Support

NCES anticipates that this work will require one (1) Task Leader, one (1) Senior Analyst, two (2) Mid Level Analysts, and three (3) Research Assistants; each of whom will spend approximately one-half (0.5) of their time on technical review, with the other half (0.5) of their time devoted to monitoring data quality and data use, updating the NCES Survey Methodology Handbook, and working on high priority research projects. NCES anticipates that two to three (2-3) undergraduate and/or graduate level interns will join the project in the summer. 



Subtask 2.c.1:   Monitoring Data Quality 

Over the year, NCES anticipates that the Task leader and the Senior Analyst will each spend approximately one (1) month on the quality control monitoring effort, while the Mid Level Analysts will expend a combined effort of three to four (3-4) months and the Statistical Research Assistants will together devote a total of approximately four (4) months.

REVIEWING NCES REPORTS—RESEARCH ASSISTANTS



The attached chart represents a collaborative effort from the NCES-ESSI Technical Review Team.  The content of the chart reflects the standards and guidelines within the NCES Statistical Standards, and the collective wisdom of many years of review experience accumulated across the entire NCES-ESSI review team. The intent is to introduce more uniformity to the review of NCES reports and, in turn, to contribute to improved quality in NCES reports.



The following chart is intended to include many of the details that should be included in the review of different types of NCES reports—Issue Brief, Statistics in Brief, First Look, Statistical Analysis, and Technical.  Start by finding the column for the type of report you are reviewing.  

Cells that are shaded do not apply.  

Cells beginning with “B” or “C” indicate whether the element identified in that row of the chart should be reported with a brief (B) or complete (C) version.  

The “B” and “C” cells and all blank cells in the column should be filled in with a “yes’ or “no.” 

It is helpful to use one side of the column for the yes/no entries that do not require further attention and the other side for those items that require corrections.



Every effort was made to make the chart as comprehensive as possible; thus, if you find that an element listed for the type of report that you are reviewing does not apply to your report, please indicate N/A and attach a justification explaining why the element does not apply.  We anticipate that this may particularly be a problem in the case of some methodology and technical reports.  For example, we recognize that much of what is listed under the technical notes for the other types of reports will in fact constitute the body of many of these reports.  In addition, there are several entries that appear in one or more parts of the report; thus, if you have already identified something as being done, simply refer to the earlier entry (e.g., introducing an acronym the first time mentioned in the text).  Please remember, however, that since the Executive Summary must stand alone, anything done in the Executive Summary must be repeated in the body of the report.

Task Order Type:  Firm Fixed Price 

Category B:  Small Business Set Aside

NAICS Code: 541720



PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



Task 2:  Statistical Standards Program Support (2) Assessment



I.  Background and Purpose 

The Statistical Standards Program (SSP) provides methodological and statistical support to NCES, as well as to federal and nonfederal organizations that engage in statistical work in support of NCES's mission. SSP takes the lead in developing and maintaining the statistical and survey methodology standards that ensure the quality of statistical surveys, analyses and products (); consults and advises on the implementation of standards for all NCES projects; conducts internal technical reviews for all NCES publications and products (see the NCES electronic publication catalog at  for examples of existing NCES publications and products); and coordinates the revision of the NCES Statistical Standards. SSP also monitors and administers confidentiality procedures (see  for information on the NCES confidentiality program) and related restricted-use data licenses (see  for information on the licensing process) for NCES data products. In addition, SSP consults and advises on emerging statistical issues and initiates, monitors or participates in long-term statistical and methodological research projects.



II. Purpose



SSP is charged with center wide responsibilities for developing and maintaining NCES Statistical Standards and Guidelines; for the technical and statistical review of NCES products, and for monitoring the use of the Statistical Standards and Guidelines as part of a quality control effort. SSP also maintains the NCES Handbook of Survey Methods, monitors the use of NCES data, and conducts special quick-turnaround research and analytic projects as the need arises. SSP also has center wide responsibilities for data privacy and data confidentiality; including providing substantive and administrative leadership to the IES/NCES Disclosure Review Board, developing and supporting the IES/NCES external user restricted use data licensing system, and supporting the NCES role in the initiation and first stage clearance of NCES contractors’ security clearance process. SSP requires technical and statistical support to fulfill its responsibilities in these areas. 















III.  Scope of Work



Task 1 – Initial Meeting 

The contractor shall meet with the NCES task leader within one week of award to review activities and refine the task schedule.  The contractor shall submit a summary of the meeting, including any revisions to the schedule, to the NCES task leader within one week of the meeting.

	

Task 2 -- Technical and Statistical Support

The contractor shall support SSP in its work developing, maintaining, and monitoring statistical, methodological, and quality standards and providing NCES staff statistical support. While the highest priority task activity shall be support for NCES internal technical reviews, related subtasks also include Quality Control, Monitoring the Use of NCES Data, and Statistical Research Projects. The skills needed for these tasks are interrelated. Due to the uneven flow of NCES products that require timely technical review, the use of the same staff for this set of technical statistical tasks will ensure a sufficient number of staff for periods when timely, high quality technical reviews are required for a large number of products, while at the same time drawing on the in-depth knowledge of the NCES Statistical Standards and the broad understanding of NCES programs on the part of skilled technical reviewers for the quality control and statistical research projects.

Subtask 2.a:      Initial Technical Review of NCES Products

Thorough in-depth review of each NCES report and data product is a cornerstone of quality control in all NCES products. The Statistical Standards Program has the responsibility for providing detailed technical reviews of all NCES products (reports, data files, file documentation, and web sites); these technical reviews must ensure that statistical standards and guidelines are met in each NCES product. NCES reports and tables that present data or describe and present analyses of data will go through a multidimensional review; multiple reviewers at NCES and from the contractor shall be assigned specific elements of each product to review simultaneously. 

Specifically, the basic elements of each product will be examined by statistical research assistant level contractor staff. These basic elements include, for example, checking for consistency in the data throughout a report; checking for significance tests that support comparisons made in a report based on sample data; checking that the data cited in the testing documentation agree with the data included in the report; checking the tables against the NCES Guidelines for Tabular Presentations (); checking figures against the NCES Statistical Standard () and checking the reports presentation for compliance with the NCES Style Guide ().  These basic elements are described in detail in the attached form titled “Reviewing NCES Reports—Statistical Research Assistants.”  (Attachment 1-2012-A_



At the same time, more analytic elements of each product will be examined by the contractor’s task leader, senior analysts, and midlevel analysts. These analytic elements include, for example, ensuring that the required information needed to set up a report is included in the introductory materials of the report; reviewing the content in the body of the report, especially the presentation of statistical findings, for clarity; ensuring that the statistical analysis and related significance tests are appropriate for, and consistent with, the findings and conclusions reported; examining tables and figures for clarity in presentation; and confirming the inclusion of required components of survey design in the technical notes of the report. These analytic elements are described in detail in the attached form “Reviewing NCES Reports—Technical Reviewers.” (Attachment 1-2012-B)

The contractor shall complete each initial review within the time period specified for individual report types. These initial reviews shall be submitted to the assigned NCES review leader and the Chief Statistician in the prescribed format using the NCES Review Template (attached).  (In the case of the Condition of Education, the reviewer comments shall be entered into the electronic data base provided by the Condition of Education team.) The reviews should each cover the content and topics identified for the specific type of report in the Reviewing NCES Reports spreadsheets (Attachments 1-2012-A and 2-2012-B). 

In addition to the specific types of NCES reports described in the following subtasks, NCES produces several comprehensive resource publications (compendia) that summarize major education statistics on the status and progress of education at one or more levels of education from preprimary through graduate education, adult education, and lifelong learning. Annual reports in this category include the Digest of Education Statistics, The Condition of Education, Crime Indicators, and Projections. The estimated volume of work expected for these reports is incorporated in the subtasks for the report types specified in the subtasks per the following descriptions.

For this task, the Projections report and any other compendia reports that are a mix of tables, figures, and text will be treated as either a First Look Report, a Statistics in Brief, or a Statistical Analysis Report, depending on the size of the report under review.

For this task, the Digest of Education Statistics will be treated as multiple table submissions, with the accompanying introductory text, chapter introductions, and technical appendix text treated collectively as one or more First Look Report, a Statistics in Brief, or a Statistical Analysis Report, depending on the number of text pages.

For this task, the Condition of Education, and other compendia based on an indicator format, will be treated as a set of Issue Briefs, with the introductory text, chapter introductions, and technical appendix text treated as one or more First Look Report, a Statistics in Brief, or a Statistical Analysis Report, depending on the number of text pages.



Subtask 2.a.1:  Tables - Each initial review of a table set shall be submitted to NCES within 10 working days from the transmittal to the contractor. Tables shall be processed in groups of 10 (i.e., a review of a set of 60 tables equals six (6) deliverables).  NCES anticipates having up to 70 table sets for review in this task in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each table set shall require approximately two and one third (2.3) hours of the task leader’s time and three (3) hours of a mid level analyst’s time.  



Subtask 2.a.2:   First Look Reports - Each initial review of a First Look Report shall be submitted to NCES within three (3) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. A First Look Report includes a brief introduction [one to three (1-3) pages], one (1) page of findings, up to 15 pages of tables, and necessary technical notes. These reports average 46 pages in length. NCES anticipates having up to 10 reports of this type for review in this task in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of a First Look Report shall require 15 hours of the task leader’s time, and eleven (11) hours of time from one (1) mid level analyst’s time. 

Subtask 2.a.3:   Statistics in Brief - Each initial review of a Statistics in Brief Report shall be submitted to NCES within 10 working days from the transmittal to the contractor. These reports are based on short, focused analyses of specific topics. Statistics in Brief reports are designed to provide data on policy-relevant topics; they include a mix of tables, figures, and text. These reports average 20 pages in length. NCES anticipates having up to 10 reports of this type for review in this task in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of a Statistics in Brief Report shall require seven (7) hours of the task leader’s time and five (5) hours of time from a mid level analyst. 

Subtask 2.a.4:   Analytic Reports - Each initial review of an analytic report shall be submitted to NCES within 13 working days from the transmittal to the contractor. This report type includes Statistical Analysis Reports that present an overview of results from one survey, or from one topic based on analysis across several surveys. The data and findings are presented with commentary to identify substantively and statistically significant results, and their relationship to educational research; they include a mix of tables, figures, and text. This report type also includes Research and Development (R&D) Reports that are detailed reports of emerging issues, state-of-the-art analytic approaches, and new software applications. The findings reported in developmental work are subject to revision as the work continues and additional data become available. These reports average 88 pages in length. NCES anticipates having up to 6 reports of this type for review in this task in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each Statistical Analysis Report shall require approximately 33 hours of the task leader’s time, 33 hours of a mid level analyst’s time. 

Subtask 2.a.5:  Issue Briefs - Each initial review of an Issue Brief shall be submitted to NCES within five (5) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. These reports are a two-to-four (2-4) page summary of a particular topic. A limited number of tables and charts are presented with descriptive text intended to provide a quick view of a current topic. NCES anticipates having up to 16 reports of this type for review in this task in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each Issue Brief shall require approximately two (2) hours of the task leader’s time and two (2) hours of a mid level analyst’s time.

Subtask 2.a.6:   Web pages - Each initial review of a set of web pages shall be submitted to NCES within five (5) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. Web pages shall be processed in groups of 10. NCES anticipates having up to 12 web page sets for review in this task in 2012. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each set of web pages shall require approximately two and one half (2.5) hours of the task leader’s time and two (2) hours of a mid level analyst’s time. 

 

Subtask 2.b:      Compliance Technical Review of NCES Products

In the NCES review process, after all reviewer comments are submitted to the author, the author prepares a response memo that includes a reply to each comment with either a proposed change or an explanation as to why no change is proposed.  The NCES Technical Review leader for the specific report reviews the author’s responses and provides comments back to the author. The author then executes the proposed changes and subsequently submits the revised draft, with an updated NCES Review Template that specifies the location and the exact nature of each change. 

This revised draft report and the revised reviewer template will be transmitted from SSP to the contractor. The contractor shall conduct a compliance review to ensure that all agreed upon changes were successfully implemented. NCES anticipates that the level of effort involved in these compliance reviews will in general be less that that required for an initial review. NCES also anticipates that the number of reviews and the level of effort with subsequent rounds of compliance review will decrease. Each compliance review shall be completed within the time period specified for individual report types. The contractor review comments shall be submitted to NCES embedded in the author’s revised NCES Review Template. Virtually all reports and products submitted to ESSI for review shall be submitted again for the first round compliance review. NCES anticipates that when needed, the level of effort required for a second round of compliance review will be substantially reduced relative to the first round compliance review for most report types.

Subtask 2.b.1:   Tables - Each compliance review of a table set shall be submitted to NCES within five (5) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. NCES anticipates having up to 70 such products. Second round compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the compliance review of a set of tables shall require one (1) hours of the task leader’s time and one (1) hour of time from a mid level analyst.

Subtask 2.b.2:   First Look Reports - Each compliance review of a First Look Report shall be submitted to NCES within three (3) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. These reports average 46 pages in length. NCES anticipates having up to 10 such products. Second compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the compliance review of First Look reports shall require approximately seven (7) hours of the task leader’s time, seven (7) hours of a mid level analyst’s time.  

Subtask 2.b.3:   Statistics in Brief - Each compliance review of a Statistics in Brief Report shall be submitted to NCES within five (5) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. These reports average 20 pages in length. NCES anticipates having up to 10 such products. Second compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the compliance review of a Statistics in Brief Report shall require approximately six (6) hours of the task leader’s time, and four (4) hours of time from a mid level analyst. 

Subtask 2.b.4:   Statistical Analysis Reports - Each compliance review of a Statistical Analysis Report shall be submitted to NCES within 10 working days from the transmittal to the contractor. These reports average 88 pages in length. NCES anticipates having up to 6 such products. Given the complexity of this type of report, NCES expects the first compliance review to be somewhat involved, requiring as much as one-half the level of effort involved in the initial review. Second compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the compliance review of each Statistical Analysis Report shall require approximately 25 hours of the task leader’s time, and 25 hours of a mid level analyst’s time. 

Subtask 2.b.5:   Issue Briefs - Each compliance review of an Issue Brief shall be submitted to NCES within five (5) working days from the transmittal to the contractor (3 in the case of the Condition of Education). NCES anticipates having up to 164 such products. Given the complexity and brevity of this type of report, NCES expects the first compliance review to be somewhat involved, requiring almost as much level of effort as that involved in the initial review. Second compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each Issue Brief shall require approximately two (2) hours of the task leader’s time and two (2) hours of amid level analyst’s time. 

Subtask 2.b.6:   Web pages - Each compliance review of a set of web pages shall be submitted to NCES within three (3) working days from the transmittal to the contractor. NCES anticipates having up to 12 such products. Second compliance review is anticipated on what will usually be a small number of unresolved issues. NCES expects that, on average, the initial review of each set of web pages shall require approximately two and one half (2.5) hours of the task leader’s time and two (2) hours of amid level analyst’s time.

The contractor shall support SSP efforts focused on monitoring specific aspects of data quality in NCES data collections. This includes the periodic updating of the center-wide report “NCES Handbook of Survey Methods” . This report was first published in 2003, and an updated version will be published before work begins under this contract.



Subtask 2.c.1:   Monitoring Data Quality - The contractor shall maintain a data base that is used for ongoing tracking of unit and item response rates; the use incentives; the analysis of nonresponse bias; the use and types of imputations; and the timeliness of various elements of data collection, data release, and reporting. NCES anticipates adding information on data quality drawn from the NCES Office of Management and the Budget (OMB) clearance packages for NCES data collections over the most recent five (5) year period. The primary emphasis of this effort is to improve our understanding of the use and wording of informed consent and confidentiality pledges across documents within single data collections and across data collections within NCES. There is also an interest in increasing our understandings of the content of the OMB pass back, with the goal of identifying recurring and emerging themes that NCES needs to address prior to submitting clearance packages. Finally this effort, will inform the ongoing monitoring of the use of incentives, including information on field experiments that are used to test alternate incentive scenarios. This work is done through extracting key information from the technical notes of initial release reports, related survey documentation and methodology reports, and OMB clearance packages. The contractor shall provide monthly updates to the data quality data base. NCES expects that the statistical research projects will require the assistance of up to one tenth (0.1) of an FTE of senior staff and  approximately one eighth (0.14) of an FTE of a midlevel analyst’s time.   



Subtask 2.c.2:   Updating the NCES Handbook of Survey Methods—The contractor shall support the ongoing revision of the center-wide report “NCES Handbook of Survey Methods” . This publication presents explanations of how each survey program in NCES obtains and prepares the data it publishes. The Handbook aims to provide users of NCES data with the information necessary to evaluate the suitability of the statistics for their needs, with a focus on the methodologies for survey design, data collection, and data processing. Each chapter focuses on a different survey system and covers a discussion of the uses of the data; key concepts measured in the survey; the design of the survey; the survey data quality and comparability with other data sources; and identifies recent methodology and evaluation reports for the survey system. Ongoing plans for this document include continuous updating of materials on recurring surveys with each new survey administration, and the addition of new chapters as new data collections are initiated.  



The contractor shall collect the information from published technical notes, survey documentation, and methodology reports; project web sites; and from NCES Project Officers responsible for individual data collections. NCES Statistical Standards related to response rates, imputations, and the general administration of surveys can be found in the NCES Statistical Standards.  Additional historical information on the methodologies of individual NCES data collection systems can be found at . 

In 2012, NCES anticipates assigning one (1) chapter on an entirely new study. NCES also anticipates assigning up to two (2) updates of existing chapters (to include information on the most recent administration of ongoing surveys). The study to be summarized in the new chapter and the two (2) chapters to be updated will be identified at the time of the kick-off meeting. The contractor shall submit a chapter on the new study on or before August 31, 2011. Developing this chapter for publication is expected to take approximately one (1) month of a senior analyst’s time. The contractor shall submit the updates for up to two (2) existing chapters in the Handbook of NCES Survey Methods (to include information of the most recent administration of ongoing surveys) with completion on or before October. Each update is expected to take approximately one and one half (1.5) week of a mid level analysts time, with supervision and review from the task leader.



Subtask 2.d:     Monitoring the Use of NCES Data  

Not assigned



Subtask 2.e:      Statistical Research Projects 

The contractor shall support SSP special analytic projects that require statistical expertise or in-depth knowledge of privacy, data confidentiality, and disclosure avoidance techniques as identified by the NCES Chief Statistician, the Commissioner of NCES, the Director of IES, or the Secretary of the Department of Education. Examples of projects of this type include the two volume 2006 report requested by the Secretary,  and ; and more recently the 2010 privacy and data confidentiality Technical Briefs developed for the Statewide Longitudinal Data System Grant Program at the request of the Statistical Policy Office of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Acting Commissioner of NCES, and . 



The contractor shall also support SSP reviews of the use of a particular dimension of data quality or more generally data collection practices, either within NCES, or across the Department and/or other statistical agencies. For example, NCES, with the support of contractor technical reviewers, participated in an interagency project within the federal statistical community to examine the use of informed consent and secondary usage of combined administrative and statistical data for statistical purposes. In another project, SSP, with the support of contractor technical reviewers, explored the feasibility of using a private vendor’s data files to monitor the employment patterns of principals from one year to the next. NCES has also been called upon by the Department to conduct analyses of alternative graduation rates, access to science technology and mathematics education, and disclosure protections employed by state education offices. Contractor technical review staff members assisted SSP in each of these endeavors. The skills needed for these statistical research projects will draw on the in-depth knowledge of the NCES Statistical Standards and the broad understanding of NCES programs that come from responsibilities for producing skilled technical reviews, for monitoring various aspects of data quality, and from supporting statistical research projects.



In addition to yet to be identified special projects, the contractor shall support SSP in its work on an interagency project specifying and defining elements of paradata and metadata across federal statistical surveys. The contractor shall provide monthly reports summarizing their work on the paradata and metadata project.  For special research products, the contractor shall produce analyses (tables and figures), analytic datasets, and written drafts of reports on special topics for at least one (1) topic. The reports will meet the requirements in the NCES Statistical Standards, NCES Tabular Guidelines, and NCES Style Guide.  Once each final report is submitted, it should require no more than two (2) more rounds of reviews/corrections to be considered delivered in a timely manner. 



NCES expects that the statistical research projects will require the assistance of up to one third (0.33) of an FTE of senior staff, one quarter (0.25) of an FTE of a midlevel analyst’s time. 



IV.  Period of Performance   



The Contractor shall complete all activities from the time of award through December 31, 2012. This PWS will be awarded for a 12 month base period with annual options for years two through five (2-5) of the contract, if exercised.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT 



Task 4:  Elementary and Secondary Longitudinal Studies Support



I.   Background 



The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) initiated its first secondary school longitudinal survey in 1972 with the National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS-72) – a study that followed a cohort of high school seniors. This study was followed by High School and Beyond (HS&B) in 1980 with sophomore and senior cohorts; the National Education Longitudinal Study of 8th graders in 1988 (NELS:88);  the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002) with a cohort of high school sophomores; and the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) which began in 2009 with a cohort of ninth graders.  Data from NLS-72 was used to examine the processes that link traditional education inputs, such as student characteristics, to outputs, such as degrees and earnings received. Since 1972, NCES secondary longitudinal studies at NCES have expanded to include eighth, ninth, and tenth grade cohorts.  In total, these studies represent the educational experiences of high school students from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. These studies permit analysis at the cross-sectional, longitudinal, and cross-cohort trend levels. As add-ons to these major longitudinal studies, NCES has collected high school and postsecondary transcripts.  To gain a better understanding of these studies, it is recommended that the contractor become familiar with the following web sites. 



http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nls72/ -- NLS-72

http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsb/ -- HS&B

http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nels88/ -- NELS:88

http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/ -- ELS:2002

  -- HSLS:09

http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hst/ -- Transcripts



NOTE:  To acquire an understanding of the NCES sponsored secondary longitudinal studies, the contractor is encouraged to review questionnaires, design documents, publications, file documentation, and data tools within each of the above web sites.



II.  Purpose 



This project will support work on the large-scale, longitudinal surveys for which the Secondary Longitudinal Studies Program (SLSP) in the Elementary, Secondary, and Library Studies Division (ESLSD) is responsible.  Large-scale data collection projects have a number of key activities, and these activities largely determine the types of support needed.  In broad terms, the activities include study design, questionnaire and assessment development, study operations, logistic and data analysis, data transcribing, document checking, updating bibliographies, working with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and with the Institute of Education sciences (IES)  Disclosure Review Board (DRB), training data users, and report writing.  In addition, NCES has a long tradition of outreach projects designed to help train external education analysts in the proper use of NCES data sets.  Project work involves support for all of these activities.  



NOTE:  CONTRACTOR STAFF PROPOSED FOR THIS CONTRACT SHALL HAVE EXPERTISE IN WORKING WITH A MAJOR LONGITUDINAL STUDY. (See Section V for staff requirements.)



III.  Scope of Work 



SLSP, one of four programs within the ESLSD Division, is in need of support in 1) producing products such as annotated bibliographies (includes HSLS:09, ELS:2002/12, and NELS:88), 2) providing SLSP with written reviews of deliverables specified in contracts for major longitudinal studies, 3) helping the SLSP provide training to outside groups, 4) conducting analyses, and 5) writing reports.  Over the life of a typical wave of data collection (60 months), there are many activities for which SLSP needs support.  These contractor activities can be broken up into the following major areas.



Survey development – Producing and reviewing questionnaires and assessment instruments. (Year # 1 of a given data collection contract)

Sample Design – Producing and checking sampling plans and strategies for collecting data. (Years # 1 and 2 of a given data collection contract)

Conducting the field test – Evaluating  procedures and surveys (years # 2 of data collection contract)

Conducting the full-scale study – Collecting data; reviewing response rates; working on follow-up activities. (Year # 3 of a given data collection contract)

Data processing – Conducting non-response bias analysis and quality control checks; developing composites and weights. (Year # 4 of a given data collection contract)

Documentation – Producing reports, data files, and data file documentation. (Year # 4 of a given data collection contract)

Data Release – Release of data products and documentation; providing training to users. (Year # 5 of a given data collection contract)



These events are spread across the 60 months of the data collection contract for a given longitudinal study.  It needs to be pointed out that at the present time, NCES is sponsoring the base year and first follow-up waves of HSLS:09 and the third follow-up of ELS:2002/12.  What this means for the bidder is that the base year of HSLS:09 is in year 4; the first follow-up of HSLS:09 is in year 2; and the third follow-up of ELS:2002/12 is in year 2.  Thus, the tasks for NCES in 2012 depend on where the studies are in the 60-month cycle (see web sites of these studies-referenced above).  For 2013, the tasks differ from 2012. For this reason, the government is interested in working with contractors who have expertise in each of the above areas. These areas (with background and purpose of longitudinal studies) are laid out in the following text with the understanding that in any given year, all tasks will not be necessary.



Study development activities include support for the current longitudinal data collections (ELS:2002, HSLS:2009, and NELS:88) and the design of future cohorts. For example, the HSLS:09 focuses on the academic and social development of students, particularly in  science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) from 9th grade entry through college.  Research questions that drive HSLS:09 include issues of postsecondary decision-making, influences on achievement and choices, and math learning.



Study operations include training and helping to monitor interviewers, determining data collection protocols and helping to monitor and possibly modifying data collection activities during field operations, and designing and preparing databases and data documentation.  The longitudinal studies for which assistance is needed are large and complex and conducted by third party contractors (RTI is the Prime contractor on both ELS:2002/12 and HSLS:09).  The survey instruments often include complex skip patterns and data editing rules.  HSLS:09 includes the use of Computer Assisted Testing (CAT) that  involves the design and use of special assessments and computer software.  Study operations assistance will require the contactor to provide staff with large-scale longitudinal survey operations experience, and staff with experience developing, testing, and using large databases that include assessments.  Contractor staff  shall also have experience with data documentation development.  



Training analysts to properly use the databases developed by studies done within the program is another key function of the project.  The contractor will provide expertise in development of training materials for large scale and complex surveys.  They will also provide expertise for both teaching statistical skills and teaching researchers how to use large-scale databases. This work shall also include development of materials for professional conference presentations of methodological and substantive research developed for the program. 



Another component of this project is to provide analytical and writing expertise. The contractor shall be prepared to conduct analyses of ELS:2002 and HSLS:09 data sets as well as participate in the writing of major reports using these data bases.  Examples of the types of reports that have been written using longitudinal data can be viewed on the NCES website (publication section).  



Task 1 – Kick-off meeting 

Within the first week after contract award, the   project Task Leaders shall hold a meeting (in Washington D.C.) with the NCES Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and the NCES Task Leaders  for this project to review the overall contract tasks, to identify potential problems and possible solutions, and to discuss areas of concern related to the proposed project staffing plan and other management requirements.  The primary purpose of this meeting is to refine the management, staffing, and scheduling plans.  These refinements are not to alter the specifications of the contract, but to provide management information for use by both the contractor and the government in monitoring the work to be performed.  This conference is also to help the contractor to make use of the experience and materials that NCES has gained over the years.  (Assume 4 hours)



Task 2 – Update NELS:88/2000/ELS:2002/HSLS:09 annotated bibliographies

Because these web sites will be updated to the end of the current contract (December 2011), it is necessary to add information on publications that will have been completed in fiscal year 2011 and beyond. The contractor will finalize the abstracts abstracted (or developed) through previously conducted  computer searches (e.g.,  DISSERTATION ABSTRACTS, ERIC, PSYCHOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS, SOCIOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS and MAJOR PAPERS, as well as the NCES.ED.GOV website) for articles that use NELS:88, ELS:2002, HSLS:09 data.  For each article, the contractor will use the existing abstract (if not copyrighted or prohibited) or create a new one that reflects the content of the article.  The bibliographical material as well as the abstract for each article will be added to the NELS:88, ELS:2002, or HSLS:09 bibliographical web sites.  

(Assume 250 hours per year)



Task 3 – HSLS:2012/ELS:2002/12 support.  

The contractor will provide support  (e.g., participate in weekly contract meetings; review contract deliverables) to the HSLS:09 and ELS:2002/12 CORs in reviewing the various stages of these two major studies.  Depending on the stage of the data collection cycle that each study is in, the tasks specified for each may be different for a given year.

Task Order Number: 6-2012

Task Order Title: Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Support

Task Order Type: Firm Fixed Price

Category B:  Small Business Set Aside

NAICS Code: 541611



PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



Task 6:  Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Support

 

I.  Background 



Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (CAFRs) are a crucial source of financial data on public school districts that have not been extensively researched and reported on.  A “CAFR” is a general-purpose financial report that is comprehensive in the depth of its reporting detail, and which provides a full disclosure of the financial affairs of the reporting entity, beyond the requirements of generally accepted accounting principles (hereafter, “GAAP”), and other applicable legal and contractual requirements. School districts are required to publish CAFRs on an annual basis. The Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards provides that every government “should prepare and publish a CAFR covering all funds and activities of the primary government (including its blended component units) and providing an overview of all discretely presented component units of the reporting entity.”  Examples of CAFRs can be obtained through the following websites: ;or  ; 



 A “CAFR” is recommended but not required under GAAP.  Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 34 does not mandate that governments prepare and publish an annual financial report.  However the minimum requirements for fair presentation in connection with general-purpose external financial reporting are mandatory, and are specified in detail in the Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards. The Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) publishes standards for the CAFRs.  GASB Statement 44, Economic Condition Reporting: The Statistical Section—an Amendment of NCGA Statement 1 (issued May 2004), provides guidance on the contents of the statistical section of a Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR).  In addition to adhering to GASB standards for required content, the CAFRs are audited, either by the state or by an external auditor, which enhances the accuracy of the data.  



The CAFR is intended to meet the needs of a broad range of users, including citizens, investors, credit rating agencies, other governments, oversight authorities, and other interested parties. The CAFR also provides supporting schedules and other information necessary to demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements and contractual provisions, and statistical data pertaining to the reporting entity.



 

II.  Purpose



The primary purpose of the project is to provide more comprehensive school finance data on the school districts to the public.  CAFRs supplement the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) data in that they provide more comprehensive school district financial data, information, and documentation for certain variables.  The CAFRs provide a substantial amount of finance information that NCES currently does not report on such as school district liabilities (both funded and unfunded), depreciable assets, financial trends, revenue capacity, debt capacity, demographic and economic information, and operating information.  



III. Scope of Work 

 

Task 1 – Initial Meeting 

The contractor shall meet with the NCES task leader within one week of award to review activities and refine the task schedule.  The contractor shall submit a summary of the meeting, including any revisions to the schedule, to the NCES task leader within one week of the meeting.



Task 2 – CAFRs Collection 



Subtask 2a:    CAFRs in PDF format 

The contractor shall collect Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports for FY 11 from twenty-five (25) school districts in PDF format (districts named below) In the event that CAFRs are not available for the districts listed below, subsequent to consultation with the Task Leader CAFRs from another district should be substituted, so that there is at least one CAFR for each of 25 districts.  The substitute districts should be chosen in collaboration with the  Task Leader; they shall be from the 100 largest school districts listed in the most recent NCES ‘Characteristics of the 100 Largest Public Elementary and Secondary School Districts in the U.S.’ publication.

Task 4 – CAFR Research and Development Report 

The contractor shall write one Research and Development Report in collaboration with NCES. The length of the report should be about 25 pages. The R&D report should have sections including, but not limited to, an introduction, an overview of CAFRs, Data Availability, Comparison of CAFRs with Other Sources of Data, and Limitations and Advantages of Using CAFRs.  The contents of various sections of the R&D report shall be developed in collaboration with NCES.  The R&D report shall be compatible with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Research and Development series of reports at the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has been initiated to share studies and research that are developmental in nature. The results of such studies may be revised as the work continues and additional data become available. The reports present results that do not reach definitive conclusions at this point in time because the data are tentative, and the methodology is new and developing. The techniques and inferences made from the data and reports are tentative and subject to revision.

Task Order Number: 15-2012

Task Order Title:  Assessment Division Support

Task Order Type:  Firm Fixed Price    

Category B:  Small Business Set aside

NAICS Code: 541611



PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



Title 15:  Assessment Division Support



I.  Background

The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is required to provide, in a timely manner, a fair and accurate measurement of educational achievement in reading, mathematics, and other content areas including writing, science, history, geography, civics, economics, foreign languages and the arts. The assessments are representative of the nation, regions, and where appropriate, states at grades 4, 8, and 12. NAEP shall also report on national long term trend assessments in reading and mathematics for students at ages 9, 13, and 17. NAEP is administered by the Assessment Division (AD) within the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES).

The current schedule of assessments to be supported is presented in Exhibit A. Exhibit B shows the development and reporting activities associated with each assessment.  



II. Purpose



The support sought with this procurement requires broad knowledge of the psychometric and operations components and nuances of NAEP.  In order to accomplish its full schedule of assessments, AD requires support in two broad areas. The work in these two areas will be awarded to separate contractors who shall work together throughout the life of the contract in support of NAEP’s mission. One broad area is included in this Task 15: NAEP Technical Support for Secondary Analysis and Coordination. This task includes six tasks: 1: Initial Meeting, 2: Provide Technical Information Support for the Assessment Division, 3: Technical Coordination Support, 4: Project Coordination Support, 5: Coordination of Support among Subtasks, 6: Integration of Reporting and Operating Support. 

The other broad area is included in a separate task, titled NAEP Statistical and Psychometric Methodology Support, Task 14. Task 14 1 includes five tasks: 1: Initial meeting, 2: Research, 3: Assessment Operations, 4: Reporting and 5: Project management and deliverables tracking. Bidders on each of these two NAEP tasks must read the Performance Work Statements for both tasks in order to fully understand the integrated nature of the required work. This Performance Work Statement requires distinct and specific skills to complete NAEP’s core work, but the core work cannot be accomplished independently of the work in the task NAEP Statistical and Psychometric Methodology Support.   




Exhibit A: NAEP Schedule of Assessments



**Assessments involving test administration by computer.
NOTES: 
(1) Grades tested are 4, 8, and 12 unless otherwise indicated, except that long-term trend assessments sample students at ages 9, 13, and 17 and are conducted in reading and mathematics.
(2) Subjects in BOLD ALL CAPS indicate the year in which a new framework is implemented or assessment year for which the Board will decide whether a new or updated framework is needed. 
(3) The Governing Board intends to conduct assessments at the 12th grade in World History and Foreign Language during the assessment period 2018-2022.  So, some technical support and review work may be required for these assessments from 2013-2016.

The Assessment Schedule is subject to change. The latest version is available at 




Exhibit B: NAEP Assessment Development Activities:  2012 – 2017





III. Scope of Work

This NAEP task, Technical Support for Secondary Analysis and Coordination, and the NAEP task, Statistical and Psychometric Methodology Support, are both required to support the full schedule of NAEP assessments and are separate requiring their own knowledge and skills.  However, the individual tasks and related subtasks cannot be accomplished without support from the companion task. For example, a secondary analysis of extant data that is produced through this technical support task may be required in a methodology report developed by the contractor working on the NAEP Statistical and Psychometric Methodology Support task. 

While maintaining the highest level of quality of work across these two separate NAEP tasks is the primary goal of AD, it would be inefficient to build complete NAEP assessment capacity in each of the two tasks. Consequently, AD envisions that there will be deliberate and planned coordination of expertise and resources across the tasks. To facilitate the coordination process, a major requirement for the NAEP Technical Support for Secondary Analysis and Coordination task, is coordination across the entire complement of tasks and subtasks included in both the NAEP Technical Support for Secondary Analysis and Coordination task and the NAEP  Statistical and Psychometric Methodology Support task.

Independently and not as an agent of the United States Government, the Contractor shall provide all personnel, materials, services, and facilities necessary for the project and perform the tasks as described below. The work to be covered under this Statement of Work begins with the award of the contract(s) in 2012, with an option of renewing the contract(s) for each of four subsequent years. 



Task 1 -- Initial Meeting

                                                       BILLING INSTRUCTIONS



All of our contractors should understand how the Department processes invoices (see Note at the bottom of this page).  The basic rule is that the Department pays you within 30 days of receipt of a proper invoice, yet close to the 30th day.  The Government has 7 days to inspect the invoice and decide if it is a proper invoice.  After 7 days, the 30 day clock may start.  There are two key terms that determine when the 30 day clock starts—receipt and proper invoice.  Receipt occurs on the latter of:

1) For invoices that are mailed, the date a proper invoice is actually received and date/time stamped in our office.  For invoices transmitted electronically, we will look at the date a readable transmission is received by our office, or if it is received after normal working hours we will use the next business day.

2) The seventh day after the date on which the property is actually delivered or the performance of services is actually completed.  This date may not be accurate if the contract calls for a longer acceptance period or if we actually accept goods or services before the seventh day.  (5 CFR § 1315.4)

	3) On the date of delivery, if specified in the contract.

4) On the date placed on the invoice by the contractor, if we fail to annotate the date of receipt in our office.  



Second, what makes an invoice a proper invoice?  An invoice is deemed proper through the following process.  We receive your invoice, and then we review it for the following information, if the information is complete then we pay it:

	1) Name of vendor

	2) Invoice date

	3) Government contract number (10 digits)

4) Vendor invoice number, account number, or other number identified in the contract

5) Description (including, for example, contract line/subline number), price, and quantity of goods or services rendered.

6) Shipping and payment terms (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract)

7) TIN (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract)

8) Banking information for payment by EFT (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract)

	9) Contact name (where practicable), title and telephone number

10) Other substantiating documentation or information required by the contract.  This documentation should include information regarding where the requested funds were spent. We need to see detailed labor hours per task, travel expenses (where travelers went, transportation costs, etc.), supplies purchased, etc.

.

If we determine that your invoice is not proper, we will return it to you and identify all defects that prevent payment. You should correct the invoice and return it to us for payment.  5 CFR § 1315.9



Item # 10 above is, in our experience, the most problematic for our contractors.  The following explanation may help you to think about the types of information to include in your invoices/vouchers. According to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 16.301-3, paragraph (a)(2), a cost-reimbursement contract requires, “Appropriate Government surveillance during the performance [that] will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls are used.”  This “surveillance” not only comes in the form of monthly reports, but more importantly, in invoicing. You have the responsibility to request reimbursement of your recorded costs; in other words, to submit an invoice on a regular basis. FAR 52.216-7, paragraph (b) defines the term costs to include the following: materials issued from the contractor's inventory and placed in the production process for use on the contract; direct labor; direct travel; other direct in-house costs; and reasonable, allocable, and allowable indirect costs (see FAR 31), as shown in the records maintained by you for purposes of obtaining reimbursement under a Government contract.  The Government has the responsibility to pay the invoice, after determining which of the costs are reasonable, allocable, and allowable. To make this determination we must receive a detailed invoice with the costs broken out.

A.		Introduction 



This performance – based Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) sets forth procedures and guidelines that the Department of Education will use in evaluating the technical performance and overall performance of the contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Task Order.  A copy of this plan will be furnished to the contractor so that the contractor will be aware of the methods that the Government will employ in evaluating performance on this contract and address any concerns that the contractor may have prior to initiating work.  The Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan and the Award Term Plan shall be contractually binding.

The QASP shall be used as a Government document to enforce the inspection and acceptance of the Task Order. The QASP describes the mechanism for documenting noteworthy accomplishments or discrepancies for work performed by the Contractor. 

The QASP can be changed/updated, etc.  It is intended to be a “living” document that should be revised or modified as circumstances warrant.  Either the Contractor or the Government may initiate changes to the QASP.  Bilateral changes may be made to the plan at any time during task order performance. Such changes may not entitle the Contractor to equitable adjustments or to any other compensation for performance in a prior period.



B.		General Purpose of the QASP



The QASP is intended to accomplish the following:

Define the roles and responsibilities of participating Government officials and outside experts;

 Describe the key deliverables and rating elements and standards of performance against which the contractor’s performance will be assessed for each deliverable;

 Describe the process for conducting quality assurance assessments;

 Provide copies of the quality assurance monitoring forms that will be used by the Government in documenting and evaluating the contractor’s performance.

 Provide basis for determining incentive involving additional work or award terms earned for the Contractor











C.		Roles and Responsibilities of Participating Government Officials

The QASP is a guide to be used by Department officials to conduct surveillance activities of the Contractor after Task Order award.  The Task Leader will review technical documents and deliverables generated by the Contractor.  ED contract managers (e.g., Contracting Officers (CO) and Contract Specialists) will also conduct review of contract specific Reports or Deliverables such as invoices, monthly status reports, and work plans. The COR and the CO will use the QASP as a tool to evaluate if the Contractor-provided service meets the performance standards in the contract and will be the basis for determining incentives involving additional work earned for the Contractor. 

 The Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) is responsible for technical administration.  However, the COR will serve as backup to the project Task Leader in monitoring and reporting on the day-to-day technical performance.  It is essential that the project Task Leader, along with the COR as backup, establish and maintain a team-oriented line of communication with the contractor’s project director on each task to ensure that the task is accomplished in an efficient and proper manner.  Phone and email contact should be held on a regular basis in order to clarify expectations, confront difficulties, and avoid serious problems.  The project Task Leader shall enlist the assistance of the COR in reviewing and evaluating the contractor’s overall performance for each individual task.



Each individual project Task Leader (TL) will be responsible for monitoring, assessing, recording and reporting on the technical performance of the contractor on each task.  The project Task Leader will be responsible for completing the QASP monitoring forms which are used to document the inspection and evaluation of the contractor’s performance related to completing the specific tasks and submission of deliverables (initial and final drafts). 



The COR or Task Leader is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government’s behalf.  Any changes that the Contractor deems may affect price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action.



The Contracting Officer (CO) or his/her representative will have overall responsibility for overseeing the contractor’s performance.  The Contract Specialist (CS) will also be responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of the contractor’s performance in the areas of contract compliance, contract administration, recording of deliveries, cost control and property control; reviewing the COR’s assessment of the contractor’s performance; and resolving differences between the COR’s version and contractor’s response to assessment.  The CO may call upon the expertise of other government individuals as required.



The Contracting Officer’s (CO) procurement authorities include the following:



	SOLE authority for any decisions which produce an increase or decrease in the scope of the contract;

	SOLE authority for any actions subject to the Changes clause;

	SOLE authority for any decision to be rendered under the Disputes clause

	SOLE authority for negotiation and determination of indirect rates to be applied to the contract;

	SOLE authority to approve the substitution or replacement of the Project Manager and other key personnel;

	SOLE authority to approve the contractor’s invoices for payment, subject to the Limitation of Costs clause and the Limitation of Funds clause;

	SOLE authority to monitor and enforce Department of Labor promulgated labor requirements;

	Authority to arrange for and supervise Quality Assurance activities under this contract;

	SOLE authority to approve the contractor’s Quality Control Program;

	Approval of all contractor purchases of equipment, supplies and materials exceeding $2,500 is encouraged even though not required by FAR 13.106; and 

	Signatory authority for the issuance of all modifications to the contract.



D. 	 	Award Term Plan



Evaluation of the Contractor’s performance will be based on the contract Activities and Standards contained in the QASP.  In order to make any change(s) to the QASP, the Government and contractor shall agree to a Modification of the Contract, that changes language in the QASP, 12 months after the start date of the contract.  The length of time provides both NCES and the contractor ample opportunities to evaluate the effectiveness of activities and standards in the QASP and to determine if change(s) are warranted.



	QASP Reporting

The project Task Leader and the COR will use a quality assurance monitoring form to document and evaluate the Contractor’s performance under each subtask. These forms will serve to document and evaluate the contractor’s overall performance. Each form will be completed by the project Task Leader with sign-off by the COR.  



The Contractor’s Task and subtasks evaluation will be based on five rating area elements, which include: (a) Quality of Product or Services; (b) Timeliness of Performance; (c) Cost Control; (d) Problem Resolution and (e) Business Relations.  A rating from 0 to 4 that most closely matches the project Task Leader’s evaluation of the contractor’s performance will be awarded for each area element, for a maximum total score of 20.  



For individual scores indicating unsatisfactory (0) or excellent (4) work, the project Task Leader and the COR will substantiate them in narrative form.  





Analysis of Surveillance Reports



The Performance Work Statement includes incentives involving work.



At the end of each quality assurance processing cycle, the COR will prepare a written report for the CO summarizing the overall results of the surveillance of the Contractor’s performance (approximately April 1, July 1, Sept 1, Jan 1) for the previous three (3) months.  Depending on the period of performance, the Contractor will be evaluated 3-4 times.  This report will become part of the formal quality assurance documentation.  The CO will review each monitoring form and may investigate the event further to determine if all the facts and circumstances surrounding the event were considered in the COR opinions outlined on the forms.  The CO will immediately discuss every event receiving a substandard rating with the Contractor to assure that corrective action is promptly initiated.



	Within 7 days after the end of an Evaluation Period each NCES Task Leader along with COR will meet to determine a rating of the Contractor’s performance on completed Contract Tasks for the preceding period. The contractor will submit a brief written self-evaluation of its performance within 5 days after the end of the evaluation period. The self-evaluation report shall not exceed seven pages, and it may be considered in the Government’s evaluation of the contractor`s performance during this period.



	The COR will forward copies of all completed Quality Assurance monitoring forms to the CO within 14 days of the end of the final evaluation period.  All contractors must be registered in Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).  The contractor will be notified through the CPARS   that past performance information is available.   The contractor shall have 30 days to review the past performance information and respond.



Contractor Performance Evaluation Points

At the end of the performance period, Contractors receiving18-20 total evaluation points will be considered to have performed Superior during the year.  These contractors will remain in the ESSIN and the Task Leader may decide to award that contractor an award term period for the next task order PWS in lieu of competing the task order in the ESSIN.   Contractors receiving 15-17 total evaluation points will be notified that their performance was Acceptable during the year; however at this level of performance the Government may decide to award that contractor an award term period for the next task order PWS in lieu of competing the task order in the ESSIN or compete the task order in the ESSIN. Contractors receiving less than 15 total evaluation points will be notified that their performance was considered Unacceptable.  The contractor will not be allowed to compete for that Task Leader’s task order during the next competition.  The contractor could respond to that particular task order after one year.  The contractor can continue to conduct work under Task orders where they have been awarded an evaluation score of 15-20 points.  



The Government’s award term determination is final and not subject to dispute under the Contract Disputes Act and FAR Clause 52.233-1 Disputes (July 2002).



E.   Contractor Task Work Performance Standards



The work will be evaluated in terms of how well the requirements are satisfied and the extent to which the work performed follows the approach found in the Contractor’s technical proposal.  The Task Leader and COR will evaluate the contractor’s performance by using the following categories:  Quality of the work and deliverables to determine accuracy, if they meet NCES statistical standards, and present information in a way that is useful for the intended audience; Timeliness to determine the contractor’s responsiveness to technical direction, if the work was performed and deliverables received as specified in the PWS; Cost Control to determine if the work and deliverables were within budget;  Problem Resolution to determine if the contractor satisfactorily overcomes or resolves problems; Business Relations to determine if the contractor exhibits effective management to perform the work and produce deliverables as specified.  



The Task Leader and COR will rate the contractor’s performance in each category as defined below. 



Unsatisfactory.  Level of performance which is not acceptable and which fails to meet the minimum standards of performance; jeopardizes the achievement of contract goals.  Score: 0



Poor.   Nonconformance requires major agency intervention to ensure achievement of contract goals.  Score: 1



Fair.  Some agency intervention required to ensure achievement of contract requirements.  Score:  2



Satisfactory.  Level of performance, which meets the minimum standards of performance.  Score:  3



Excellent.  Level of performance, which exceeds the minimum standards of performance.   Score:  4

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS (MAY 2011)

(a) In accordance with Department of Education regulations on the protection of human subjects in research, title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, part 97 ("the regulations"), the contractor, any subcontractors, and any other entities engaged in covered (nonexempt) research activities are required to establish and maintain procedures for the protection of human subjects. The definitions in 34 CFR 97.102 apply to this clause. As used in this clause, covered research means research involving human subjects that is not exempt under 34 CFR 97.101(b) and 97.401(b). (b) If ED determines that proposed research activities involving human subjects are covered (i.e., not exempt under the regulations), the contracting officer or contacting officer?s designee will require the contractor to apply for the Federal Wide Assurance from the Office for Human Research Protections, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, if the contractor does not already have one on file. The contracting officer will also require that the contractor obtain and send to the Department documentation of Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval of the research. (c) In accordance with 34 CFR part 97, all subcontractors and any legally separate entity (neither owned nor operated by the contractor) that will be engaged in covered research activities under or related to this contract shall be required to comply with the requirements for assurances and IRB approvals. The contractor must include the substance of this clause, including paragraph (c) of this clause, in all subcontracts, and must notify any other entities engaged in the covered research activities of their responsibility to comply with the regulations. (d) Under no condition shall the contractor conduct, or allow to be conducted, any covered research activity involving human subjects prior to the Department?s receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. (34 CFR 97.103(f)). No covered research involving human subjects shall be initiated under this contract until the contractor has provided the contracting officer (or the contracting officer?s designee) a properly completed certification form certifying IRB review and approval of the research activity, and the contracting officer or designee has received the certification. This restriction applies to the activities of each participating entity. (e) In accordance with 34 CFR 97.109(e), an IRB must conduct continuing reviews of covered research activities at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but not less than once a year. Covered research activities that are expected to last one year or more are therefore subject to review by an IRB at least once a year. (1) For each covered activity under this contract that requires continuing review, the contractor shall submit an annual written representation to the contracting officer (or the contracting officer?s designee) stating whether covered research activities have been reviewed and approved by an IRB within the previous 12 months. The contractor may use the form titled "Protection of Human Subjects: Assurance Identification/Certification/Declaration of Exemption" for this representation. For multi-institutional projects, the contractor shall provide this information on its behalf and on behalf of any other entity engaged in covered research activities for which continuing IRB reviews are required. (2) If the IRB disapproves, suspends, terminates, or requires modification of any covered research activities under this contract, the contractor shall immediately notify the contracting officer in writing of the IRB?s action. (f) The contractor shall bear full responsibility for performing as safely as is feasible all activities under this contract involving the use of human subjects and for complying with all applicable regulations and requirements concerning human subjects. No one (neither the contractor, nor any subcontractor, agent, or employee of the contractor, nor any other person or organization, institution, or group of any kind whatsoever) involved in the performance of such activities shall be deemed to constitute an agent or employee of the Department of Education or of the Federal government with respect to such activities. The contractor agrees to discharge its obligations, duties, and undertakings and the work pursuant thereto, whether requiring professional judgment or otherwise, as

PAGE 29 OF 83

an independent contractor without imputing liability on the part of the Government for the acts of the contractor and its employees. (g) Upon discovery of any noncompliance with any of the requirements or standards stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause, the contractor shall immediately correct the deficiency. If at any time during performance of this contract, the contracting officer determines, in consultation with the Protection of Human Subjects Coordinator, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, or the sponsoring office, that the contractor is not in compliance with any of the requirements or standards stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause, the contracting officer may immediately suspend, in whole or in part, work and further payments under this contract until the contractor corrects such noncompliance. Notice of the suspension may be communicated by telephone and confirmed in writing. (h) The Government may terminate this contract, in full or in part, for failure to fully comply with any regulation or requirement related to human subjects involved in research. Such termination may be in lieu of or in addition to suspension of work or payment. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the Government?s right to terminate the contract for failure to fully comply with such requirements. (i) The regulations, and related information on the protection of human research subjects, can be found on the Department?s protection of human subjects in research Web site: http://ed.gov/ about/offices/list/ocfo/humansub.html.

PAGE 32 OF 83

accessibility of its programs and activities, specifically its obligation to acquire and use accessible electronic and information technology. ED maintains the manual, "Requirements for Accessible Software Design," to convey the accessibility

needs of the Department to the developers and suppliers of computer applications. To comply with the provisions of this

clause, the contractor may use the edition of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design" in effect at the date of award of this contract or any more recent edition. A copy of the most recent edition of the manual may be found at http://www.ed.gov/fund/contract/apply/clibrary/software.html (a) Software delivered to or developed for ED--Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this clause, all software delivered to or developed for ED, under this contract, for use by ED's employees or external customers must meet all the requirements of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." However, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, the contracting officer may waive a particular requirement of the ED Manual, provided that ED's use of the software will meet the requirements of Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d, as amended). (b) Software enhanced or modified for ED--Any enhancements and other modifications, made under this contract to software for use by ED's employees or external customers, are subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this clause, regardless of where or how the software was first developed. Except as otherwise specified elsewhere in the contract schedule, the contractor is only required to ensure that enhancements or modifications (not other, preexisting features or components) of the software fully comply with the accessibility requirements of paragraph (a). However, the contractor is encouraged point out any preexisting features or components that do not meet accessibility requirements and to suggest solutions to ensure the software complies. (c) Waiver of requirements--It is recognized that new technologies may provide solutions that are not envisioned in or consistent with the provisions of the manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." Also, compliance with certain requirements of the manual may not be feasible for the particular software required. In such extraordinary circumstances, the contracting officer may grant a waiver, in writing, to any requirement of the manual or of this clause if it furthers a public interest of ED and will not significantly impair ED's ability to ensure accessibility of its programs and activities to all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities. To request a waiver, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing, listing the specific accessibility requirements that would not be met and explaining how the accessibility of a particular feature can be achieved by alternative means or why it is not feasible to
PAGE 33 OF 83

make a feature of the software accessible. (d) Condition of payment--The contractor agrees that compliance with the provisions of this clause upon delivery of the software to ED is a condition of payment under this contract. H. 15 317-1 ACCOMMODATION/ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE DISABLED (OCTOBER 1999)

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN & AWARD TERM

PAGE 35 OF 83

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN AND AWARD TERM PERIODS The work performed under this contract is subject to the technical review of the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). In general, the work will be evaluated in terms of how well the requirements of the contract are satisfied and the extent to which the work performed follows the time-line and the approach set forth in the contractor's proposal to individual Task Orders. It is the government's intent to issue performance based task orders to the fullest extent possible. Each performance based task order will be evaluated in accordance with a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). The QASP will entail a list of key deliverables, services, or other activities; the evaluation criteria; and the possible award term periods. To be eligible for any award term periods, any key deliverables, services, or other activities must be delivered or completed within the time period specified in the task order. The only exception will be for government caused delay. In the event of government caused delay, the contractor shall notify the CO of the delay and request the CO amend the due date accordingly. The decision to amend the due date rests solely with CO and is not subject to the Disputes clause. To be eligible for any award term periods, any key deliverables, services, or other activities must be delivered or completed within the budget specified in the contractor's final proposal revisions. The only exception is if the CO modifies the task order in writing. The decision to amend the task order lies solely with CO and is not subject to the Disputes clause. The determination of an award term periods will be made unilaterally and in writing by the CO. This decision is not subject to appeal under the Disputes clause. The CO's determination regarding any award term periods does not alter the contractor's responsibilities to perform their contractual obligations. SEE ATTACHMENT - QASP

AWARD-TERM (MAY 2011)

(a) The initial base contract term or ordering period may be extended or reduced on the basis of contractor performance, resulting in a contract term or an ordering period lasting at least 2 years from the date of contract award, to a maximum of 5 years after the date of contract award. (b) The contractor`s performance will be measured against stated standards by the performance monitors, who will report their findings to the Award Term Determining Official (or Board).

(f) Award terms that have not begun may be cancelled (rather than terminated), should the need for the items or services no longer exists. No equitable adjustments to the contract price are applicable, as this is not the same procedure as a termination for convenience.

(a) (1) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: (i) Unequal access to information. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. (ii) Biased ground rules. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract. (iii) Impaired objectivity. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent, or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations

(2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. (3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802.

(d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. (e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e). (f) Conflict of Interest Certification. The offeror, ____________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. __________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government?s satisfaction, such conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest).

"In writing," "writing," or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. "Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) "Amendments to solicitations." If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) "Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals."

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

PAGE 63 OF 83

(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award. (4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items. (5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

(7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer. (8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. (d) "Offer expiration date." Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) "Restriction on disclosure and use of data." Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall-(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed-in whole or in part-for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in connection withthe submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) "Contract award." (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (f) (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so.
PAGE 64 OF 83

(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.

(End of Provision) L. 3 52.219-7 NOTICE OF PARTIAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE (JUN 2003)

(a) "Definitions." "Small business concern", as used in this clause, means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the size standards in this solicitation. (b) "General." (1) A portion of this requirement, identified elsewhere in this solicitation, has been set aside for award to one or more small business concerns. (2) Offers on the non-set-aside portion will be evaluated first and award will be made on that portion in accordance with the provisions of this solicitation. (3) The set-aside portion will be awarded at the highest unit price(s) in the contract(s) for the non-set-aside portion, adjusted to reflect transportation and other costs appropriate for the selected contractor(s). (4) The contractor(s) for the set-aside portion will be selected from among the small business concerns that submitted responsive offers on the non-set-aside portion. Negotiations will be conducted with the concern that submitted the lowest responsive offer on the non-set-aside portion. If the negotiations are not successful or if only part of the set-aside portion is awarded to that concern, negotiations will be conducted with the concern that submitted the second-lowest responsive

PAGE 65 OF 83

offer on the non-set-aside portion. This process will continue until a contract or contracts are awarded for the entire set-aside portion. (5) The Government reserves the right to not consider token offers or offers designed to secure an unfair advantage over other offerors eligible for the set-aside portion. (c) "Agreement." For the set-aside portion of the acquisition, a small business concern submitting an offer in its own name shall furnish, in performing the contract, only end items manufactured or produced by small business concerns in the United States or its outlying areas. If this procurement is processed under simplified acquisition procedures and the total amount of this contract does not exceed $25,000, a small business concern may furnish the product of any domestic firm. This paragraph does not apply to construction or service contracts.

(End of Clause) L. 4 52.222-24 PREAWARD ON-SITE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY COMPLIANCE EVALUATION (FEB 1999)

If a contract in the amount of $10 million or more will result from this solicitation, the prospective Contractor and its known first-tier subcontractors with anticipated subcontracts of $10 million or more shall be subject to a preaward compliance evaluation by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), unless, within the preceding 24 months, OFCCP has conducted an evaluation and found the prospective Contractor and subcontractors to be in compliance with Executive Order 11246.

(End of Provision) L. 5 52.237-10 IDENTIFICATION OF UNCOMPENSATED OVERTIME (OCT 1997)

(a) "Definitions." As used in this provision-"Uncompensated overtime" means the hours worked without additional compensation in excess of an average of 40 hours per week by direct charge employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. Compensated personal absences such as holidays, vacations, and sick leave shall be included in the normal work week for purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours. "Uncompensated overtime rate" is the rate that results from multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the proposed hours per week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20 per hour would be converted to an uncompensated overtime rate of $17.78 per hour ($20.00 x 40 divided by 45=$17.78). (b) For any proposed hours against which an uncompensated overtime rate is applied, the offeror shall identify in its proposal the hours in excess of an average of 40 hours per week, by labor category at the same level of detail as compensated hours, and the uncompensated overtime rate per hour, whether at the prime or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct. (c) The offeror's accounting practices used to estimate uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost accounting practices used to accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours. (d) Proposals that include unrealistically low labor rates, or that do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism, will be considered in a risk assessment and will be evaluated for award in accordance with that assessment. (e) The offeror shall include a copy of its policy addressing uncompensated overtime with its proposal.

In accordance with Department of Education regulations on the protection of human subjects, title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, part 97 ("the regulations"), the contractor, any subcontractors, and any other entities engaged in covered (nonexempt) research activities are required to establish and maintain procedures for the protection of human subjects.

PAGE 66 OF 83

(b) Definitions. (1) The regulations define research as "a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge." (34 CFR 97.102(d)). If an activity follows a deliberate plan designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, it is research. Research includes activities that meet this definition, whether or not they are conducted under a program considered research for other purposes. For example, some demonstration and service programs may include research activities. (2) The regulations define a human subject as a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or obtains identifiable private information. (34 CFR 97.102(f)). The definition of a human subject is met if an activity involves obtaining-(i) Information about a living person by-(A) Manipulating that person?s environment, as might occur when a new instructional technique is tested; or (B) Communicating or interacting with the individual, as occurs with surveys and interviews; or (ii) Private information about a living person in such a way that the information can be linked to that individual (the identity of the subject is or may be readily determined by the investigator or associated with the information). Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that an individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a school health record). (c) Exemptions. The regulations provide exemptions from coverage for activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories set forth in 34 CFR 97.101(b)(1)-(6). However, if the research subjects are children, the exemption at 34 CFR 97.101(b) (2) (i.e., research involving the use of educational tests, survey procedures, interview procedures or observation of public behavior) is modified by 34 CFR 97.401(b), as explained in paragraph (d) of this provision. Research studies that are conducted under a Federal statute that requires without exception that the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information will be maintained throughout the research and thereafter, e.g., the Institute of Education Sciences confidentiality statute, 20 U.S.C. 9573, are exempt under 34 CFR 97.101(b)(3)(ii). (d) Children as research subjects. Paragraph (a) of 34 CFR 97.402 of the regulations defines children as "persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted." Paragraph (b) of 34 CFR 97.401 of the regulations provides that, if the research involves children as subjects-(1) The exemption in 34 CFR 97.101(b)(2) does not apply to activities involving-(i) Survey or interview procedures involving children as subjects; or (ii) Observations of public behavior of children in which the investigator or investigators will participate in the activities being observed. (2) The exemption in 34 CFR 97.101(b)(2) continues to apply, unmodified by 34 CFR 97.401(b), to-(i) Educational tests; and (ii) Observations of public behavior in which the investigator or investigators will not participate in the activities being observed. (e) Proposal Instructions. An offeror proposing to do research that involves human subjects must provide information to the Department on the proposed exempt and nonexempt research activities. The offeror should submit this information as an attachment to its technical proposal. No specific page limitation applies to this requirement, but the offeror should be brief and to the point. (1) For exempt research activities involving human subjects, the offeror should identify the exemption(s) that applies and provide sufficient information to allow the Department to determine that the designated exemption(s) is appropriate. Normally, the narrative on the exemption(s) can be provided in one paragraph. (2) For nonexempt research activities involving human subjects, the offeror must cover the following seven points in the information it provides to the Department: (i) Human subjects'' involvement and characteristics: Describe the characteristics of the subject population, including their anticipated number, age range, and health status. Identify the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of any subpopulation. Explain the rationale for the involvement of special classes of subjects, such as children, children with disabilities, adults with disabilities, persons with mental disabilities, pregnant women, institutionalized individuals, or others who are likely to be vulnerable. (ii) Sources of materials: Identify the sources of research material obtained from or about individually identifiable living human subjects in the form of specimens, records, or data. (iii) Recruitment and informed consent: Describe plans for the recruitment of subjects and the consent procedures to be followed.

PAGE 67 OF 83

(iv) Potential risks: Describe potential risks (physical, psychological, social, financial, legal, or other) and assess their likelihood and seriousness. Where appropriate, discuss alternative treatments and procedures that might be advantageous to the subjects. (v) Protection against risk: Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing potential risks, including risks to confidentiality, and assess their likely effectiveness. Where appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse effects to the subjects. Also, where appropriate, describe the provisions for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of the subjects. (vi) Importance of knowledge to be gained: Discuss why the risks to the subjects are reasonable in relation to the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. (vii) Collaborating sites: If research involving human subjects will take place at collaborating site(s), name the sites and briefly describe their involvement or role in the research. Normally, the seven-point narrative can be provided in two pages or less. (3) If a reasonable potential exists that a need to conduct research involving human subjects may be identified after award of the contract and the offeror?s proposal contains no definite plans for such research, the offeror should briefly describe the circumstances and nature of the potential research involving human subjects. (f) Assurances and Certifications. (1) In accordance with the regulations and the terms of this provision, all contractors and subcontractors that will be engaged in covered human subjects research activities shall be required to comply with the requirements for Assurances and Institutional Review Board approvals, as set forth in the contract clause 3452.224-72 (Research activities involving human subjects). (2) The contracting officer reserves the right to require that the offeror have or apply for the assurance and provide documentation of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the research prior to award. (g) (1) The regulations, and related information on the protection of human research subjects, can be found on the Department?s protection of human subjects in research Web site: http://ed.gov/about/ offices/list/ocfo/humansub.html. (2) Offerors may also contact the following office to obtain information about the regulations for the protection of human subjects and related policies and guidelines: Protection of Human Subjects Coordinator U.S. Department of Education Office of the Chief Financial Officer Financial Management Operations 400 Maryland Avenue, SW.

Beyond that initial request, you do not need to follow up with the reference; the contracting officer will contact the reference if necessary. F. Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offerors' relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. The "Contractor Performance Information" form identified in Section J will be used to collect this information. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.

It is required that your business proposal contain enough information for a cost realism determination to be made. Offerors are expected to use their best business judgment in submitting the necessary information. The Contracting Officer can reject an offeror's proposal if a negative cost realism determination is made, or if proposed prices are found to NOT be reasonable. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.404-1 states "cost realism means the costs in an Offeror's proposal are a) realistic for the work to be performed; b) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and c) are consistent with the various elements of the Offeror's technical proposal." Pricing information for five years should be provided for each Task Order (Clause 301-23 Labor Classification and Rates April 1997) Pricing information includes labor rates as complete charges, inclusive of wage payment, overhead, indirect costs and profit application. Personnel supplied under the classifications shall minimally meet the qualification levels for each labor category included as part of the Performance Work Statement. Please provide labor rates for each of the following periods: (See Attachment B) October 1, 2011-December 31, 2011 January 1, 2012-December 31, 2013 January 1, 2013-December 31, 2014 January 1, 2014-December 31, 2015 January 1, 2015-December 31, 2016 Offerors shall submit their labor rates broken out, not fully loaded. Offeror's labor rate should be consistent with their current labor rates. Offerors are permitted to propose discounted rates to improve the competitiveness of their proposal. The labor mix and labor categories proposed should be consistent with the personnel proposed in the technical proposal. 5

Offerors should submit proposed costs itemized for each task/subtask, as well as a total proposed cost for the entire work to be performed under the task order. The proposed budget for each task and subtask should indicate the number of hours being proposed for each staff person and breakdowns of direct charges for materials, supplies, consultants, equipment, telephone, copying, travel, and any other major budget items, as well as indirect cost rates used in preparing the cost estimate. The offeror shall include information on the status of your accounting system, estimating system, purchasing system. If these systems have been reviewed and approved by a Government Agency, include a copy of the approval letter. Indirect rates shall be in accordance with your current provisional billing rate agreements. A copy of current indirect rate agreements shall be included with the business proposal. Similar cost information shall also be submitted for all subcontractors. Task Order Types The Department anticipates that this contract will have task orders that are Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Firm Fixed Price Level of Effort (FFP LOE), and Cost Reimbursement (CR). In addition to the budget information described above, Offerors shall submit the following information based on task order type: Firm Fixed Price Task Orders: Firm Fixed Price task orders shall include the total firm fixed price, schedule of deliverables, and a corresponding pricing and payment schedule. Offerors shall include the price of each deliverable or task in the pricing and payment schedule. ED will pay for deliverables and tasks that have been accepted in the corresponding invoice. Fixed Price Level of Effort Task Orders: Fixed Price Level of Effort Task Orders shall order specific hourly labor applications. Hours shall be secured by labor classification and corresponding fixed loaded labor rates. Loaded Labor rates shall be as specified in the pricing schedule and payment schedule. Ordered hours shall serve as ceilings for use for each specified labor classification under the subject tasks. Offerors submitting proposals for Firm Fixed Price Level of Effort task orders shall include number of hours per task, labor categories, direct rates, indirect rates, profit, spend rate (number of hours spent per month), and any uncompensated hours included in estimate. ED will pay for the hours spent and monthly reports associated with corresponding invoice. Cost Reimbursement Task Orders: The Contractor's proposal shall include the total not-toexceed amount, authorized hours of labor by labor classification and authorized dollar amounts for labor, materials, and materials overhead. The Government shall pay the contractor, upon submission of proper invoices, for reasonable costs incurred in performance of the tasks. Note: Propose all numbers in the proposal rounded to the nearest dollar. Transition Periods The Government may decide to authorize an Optional Task and implement a transition period for certain tasks, if funding permits. Offerors shall submit a fixed price estimate for the transition period if applicable. The transition period would allow the current contractor to conduct 6

PAGE 79 OF 83

information sessions with new ESSIN contractors to support a smooth transfer and or handoff of contract work that must begin on January 1, 2012. The transition period, if implemented, would not affect the contract periodicity detailed in section V. If a transition period is necessary, the Period of Performance will be December 5-16, 2011. No other start-up costs are anticipated to support work under this contract. The list of tasks that require hours during the transition period of performance is detailed for in the Performance Work Statement VIII. START UP. Small Business Subcontracting Plan ­ Group A Large Contractors only Offerors must submit a small business-subcontracting plan, in accordance with 48 CFR, 19.702 Statutory Requirements, with their proposal. Offerors shall state the type of work to be performed by a small business and the percentage of work proposed to be performed by a small business. The offeror shall also state the name of the small business and type of small business concern. Offerors shall submit a summary page with all subcontractors (small and large businesses) listed by total subcontracting dollars and percentages of subcontracting dollars. ED's current subcontracting small business goals are as follows: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Small Business 37.3% Small disadvantaged business concerns 5% Women-owned small business concerns 5% HUBZone small business concerns 3% Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business concerns 3%

Note -- The categories listed above imply no order of preference. The goals are a percentage of total subcontract dollars. The Department values an approach where substantive work in a meaningful capacity is performed by small businesses more highly than an approach which only menial work or supply line work is performed by small businesses. A meaningful capacity for substantive work includes work other than courier services, office supplies or travel services. Therefore, a valued approach for this contract will be one which technical, analytical, or significant service is performed by a small business. See Evaluation Criteria for further information.

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M. 1 312-14 MULTIPLE AWARDS (APRIL 1998)

The Government intends to award multiple contracts under this request for proposals. Proposals will only be competed between other proposals submitted on the same subject matter. M. 2 Proposal Evaluation Criteria

PAGE 81 OF 83

EDUCATION STATISTICS SUPPORT INSTITUTE NETWORK

Proposal Evaluation Criteria
As indicated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), the Education Statistics Support Network will include two groups (A & B) each consisting of a number of Task Orders (TOs), to satisfy requirements via a cost reimbursement or fixed-price purchase order. Proposals for each group will be evaluated independently of those in the other groups; therefore offerors must submit complete Technical and Business proposal(s) for each PWS in the group in which they would like to compete. More details regarding the contents of proposals can be found in the "Instructions to Offerors" document, Attachment A. Consistently across all groups, proposals will be evaluated using a best-value approach based on tradeoffs. There will be three primary factors: past performance, technical capability, and price. Past performance and technical capability will be the most important evaluation criteria. Price is less important than past performance or technical capability, but as past performance and technical capability become closer to equal, price becomes more important. While the relative importance of the three proposal sections will be evaluated consistently across all groups, the proposals submitted for each group will only be evaluated against the others within that group. Please note that this document contains the criteria that will be used to award TOs.

PAST PERFORMANCE
Past performance will be evaluated on a 30-point scale, as follows:   Amount of Experience (10 Points): Proposals will be evaluated in this sub-category by the amount of relevant experience demonstrated, either with Department of Education contracts, contracts with other agencies, or work in the private sector. Breadth of Experience (10 Points): Proposals will be evaluated in this sub-category by the variety of experience within the relevant group. Offerors demonstrating experience with a variety of projects will be ranked more highly than those whose experience has been more narrowly focused. In addition, offerors demonstrating experience with a broader array of educational issues (as identified in the "Instructions to Offerors" document) will be ranked more highly than those with experience in fewer areas. Quality of Experience (10 Points): Proposals will be evaluated in this sub-category by the quality of the past performance reports created by the agency for which they worked.



TECHNICAL CAPABILITY
Technical capability will be evaluated on a 70-point scale, as follows:

1

PAGE 82 OF 83









Demonstrated Understanding of the PWS (35 Points): Proposals will be evaluated in this sub-category on the basis of a demonstrated understanding of and familiarity with the issues, approaches, and challenges inherent in the work described in the PWS. The soundness of technical approach will be evaluated based on how well the proposal demonstrates an understanding of the purpose and context of the PWS, the major issues and objectives involved in such work and the offeror's technical response for addressing the work as described in the PWS. Staff Qualifications (20 Points): Proposals will be evaluated in this sub-category on the basis of the quality of the offeror's staffing, both with respect to specific individuals identified as potential task leader/project director, and with respect to the qualifications and capabilities of the senior staff and the offeror's ability to recruit and add expert staff as required. The technical qualifications of proposed staff will be evaluated based on offeror's demonstration that they have experience and expertise in the program areas, policy issues, and methodologies necessary to undertake projects within this requirement. In addition, the task leader/project director will be evaluated on their experience in conducting task work, monitoring contract budgets and controlling business, adhering to project schedules, ensuring the quality and timeliness of contract deliverables, and directing and managing projects. Management Plan (5 Points): Proposals will be evaluated in this subcategory on the plan to manage the flow of and ensure consistent quality in multiple, simultaneous, complex subtasks and to coordinate the work of subcontractors and external experts. The plan will be evaluated on the reality of a plan that will ensure consistent high quality, timeliness, responsiveness to the needs of NCES, and adherence to budget. The capabilities and experience of the project director/task leader will also be evaluated. Corporate Expertise, Capability, and Oversight (10 Points): Proposals will be evaluated in this sub-category on the basis of evidence of a strong corporate commitment and oversight. Some examples of considerations in this area are management plans, approaches to problem solving and communication, and a demonstration of adequate infrastructure (sufficient office space, equipment, etc.).

SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING (10 points)
Small Business Subcontracting will be evaluated on a 10-point scale, as follows:





The Large Business contractor demonstrates integration of small businesses into a significant portion of the project as evidenced by the small business plan; small business plans that exceed the minimum of 37.3% of subcontract dollars awarded to small business may earn up to 10 points. The Small Business contractor automatically receives 10 points.
