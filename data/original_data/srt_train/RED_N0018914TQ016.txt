PAPERLESS CONTRACTING: All contractual documents (i.e. contracts, purchase orders, task orders, delivery orders and modifications) related to the instant procurement are considered to be "issued" by the government when copies are either deposited in the mail, transmitted by facsimile, or sent by other electronic commerce methods, such as email. The government's acceptance of the contractor's proposal constitutes bilateral agreement to "issue" contractual documents as detailed herein. 508 STATEMENT: For EIT requirements include the following language unless an exception applies: This procurement is for Electronic and Information Technology (EIT). Effective June 25, 2001, the Federal government implemented Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Amendments of 1998 (29 U.S.C. S 794(d)). Section 508 requires that the federal government only acquire electronic and information technology goods and services that provide for access by persons with disabilities. Therefore, to the extent supplies and services are available in the commercial marketplace, the contractor is required to meet the relevant accessibility standards contained in 36 C.F.R. Part 1194 (Subpart B). For further information see http://www.section508.gov.

N00189-14-T-Q016 Page 4 of 4 BRAND NAME STATEMENT: FLENUMMETOCCEN's supercomputer suite reflects an investment of several million dollars. This acquisition covers maintenance, and on-going support of existing hardware. Support for the software included with these systems is required by SECNAVINST 5230.15. FLENUMMETOCCEN's supercomputers (nodes, switches, disks, associated components, software, etc.) are at the heart of its mission-critical operational capability. FLENUMMETOCCEN has made a substantial investment of both hardware and personnel training to achieve the current state of operational capability and functionality. Support for the NetApp storage systems must be provided by NETAPP who is certified to provide hardware, software, and firmware support on the NetApp storage systems. Failure of these NetApp storage systems can render the entire FLENUMMETOCCEN supercomputer inoperable and thus unable to run numerical weather. Failure to provide timely weather products could jeopardize Navy operations world-wide. These NetApp storage systems are at the core of the product distribution system and are critical if customers are to receive METOC products from FLENUMMETOCCEN. The following FAR / DFAR clauses are incorporated by reference: 52.204-7 System For Award Management JUL 2013 52.204-13 System For Award Management Maintenance JUL 2013 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items JUL 2013 52.212-3 DEV Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items SEP 2013 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports JUN 2012
