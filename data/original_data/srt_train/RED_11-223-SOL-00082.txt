Introduction
1.1. Background
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collects physical and/or documentary samples of various FDA regulated products or related evidence for laboratory analysis or other examinations to determine whether or not they are adulterated or misbranded, as well as whether they meet quality standards as defined by the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and related Acts. The results of these physical sample analyses and other activities are reported in a set of documents herein referred to as an analytical work package. The management and tracking of samples is one of the most critical of FDA's post market activities. The success of FDA enforcement depends on the ability to provide a complete chain of custody for collected samples and on the ability of the Agency to demonstrate that the results of the laboratory analysis are complete, accurate, and definitively linked to the inspection or investigation which collected them. Over 17 million imported products under the regulatory authority of FDA entered the United States in 2008. To stop distribution of a product that has been judged to be risky, FDA must demonstrate the risk to the public, and that demonstration depends on analyses done by the Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) laboratories. Similarly, the ability to successfully stop domestic sale of foods, drugs, or other regulated products that pose a health or safety risk to the public depends on FDA's ability to present evidence in a court of law. To provide the necessary evidence, effective sample management (the recording and tracking of data associated with sample receipt, storage, transfers and disposition) is critical and must be subjected to rigorous quality control throughout the analytical process to meet the Agency's own quality assurance policies which are based on the rules of civil procedure published by the Department of Justice. ORA operates a total of 14 permanent field laboratories five regional, seven district and two specialized laboratories (forensics and radiochemistry/devices). In addition, the FDA has two mobile laboratories. The individual Centers have 11 laboratories. All laboratories require a range of quality-related attributes such as audit trails and standardization in order to remain accredited or certified by relevant standards organizations. Each laboratory is equipped for certain analysis types (e.g. microbiology, food chemistry, drug chemistry, etc.). Please see the attached documents titled "Laboratory Staff Size," "ALM - LIMS Requirements Repository," and "ORA Laboratories Locations and Capabilities" for more information. Currently, laboratory staff members manually enter summary analytical data both on paper and electronically into the Agency's legacy system (Field Accomplishments and Compliance Tracking System (FACTS)). Because of the duplicate effort required for data entry, only limited results are shared electronically with other ORA units involved in the regulatory process. Full sample documentation--the analytical package--is transmitted to other ORA components primarily in hard copy or on a Compact Disk Â­ Read Only Memory (CD-ROM). In addition, the current paperbound practices limit the ability to conduct concurrent analyses of a given sample. Difficulties in sharing data until it has been entered into FACTS prevents participants in the concurrent processing from easily consolidating results and managing the reviews. As a result of these inefficiencies, large amounts of data from laboratory analyses are not readily available for use outside of the laboratories. With a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) solution, however, the data for each sample and its associated analytical results are collected and stored entirely in electronic form, creating a managerial and record-keeping situation that will improve the efficiency of the laboratories. For example, it would increase the efficiency of laboratory staff by providing them with more time for each inspection and grouping laboratory assignments on the basis of similarities. It would also facilitate splitting samples among

Page 2 of 13

LIMS IDIQ--Statement of Work
any number of analysts, whether in the same laboratory or in different laboratories, and thus speed analysis through concurrent handling. The use of a LIMS would also be highly amenable to support ORA initiatives outside of the laboratories. Information could be collected quickly to compare methodologies, to better trace violative goods, and to identify firms engaged in illegal activities, all without needing to request reports from the laboratories. The LIMS solution will need to be integrated with ORA and other FDA systems, such as Mission Accomplishments and Regulatory Compliance Services (MARCS), Regulatory Business Information Services (RBIS), and other Automated Laboratory Management (ALM) systems, including the Quality Management Information System (QMIS). For instance, MARCS components and services are being developed and maintained under a separate contract that has already been awarded. MARCS will serve as the primary conduit of information between systems regarding inspections of goods and enforcement of FDA policies on domestic and foreign goods, and there is some overlap of functions between a LIMS solution and MARCS. As MARCS services may in some cases be used to satisfy the LIMS project requirements, the LIMS solution will likely be a combination of an integrated suite of configurable Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) products with some custom development and utilization of some MARCS components and/or services. This overlap of functions must be minimized. Likewise, the overlap of functions between LIMS and RBIS must be minimized. The use of the phrase LIMS COTS throughout this document refers to a solution which is either a COTS "suite" from a single vendor or a collection of COTS components from multiple vendors and/or custom code which, when fully and efficiently integrated, fulfills FDA enterprise and specifically ORA Laboratory and Field requirements as regards samples, sampling, and sample analysis within legal and scientific controls and parameters. The use of the phrase LIMS Solution refers to the amalgamation of the entire set of applications (both COTS and custom code), and interfaces that together meet the project's requirements. Details on MARCS and its components can be found in the attachments. The LIMS solution is part of a larger ORA workflow and must be part of a comprehensive approach to the FDA regulatory processes. The FDA anticipates the LIMS solution to support ORA Laboratories' primary functions listed as: a) Sample management Â­ where the LIMS solution would assist and/or automate the recording and tracking of data associated with sample receipt, storage, transfers and disposition. b) Sample analysis Â­ where the LIMS solution would support laboratory analysis work through (1) improving sample analysis throughput and improving support for the management of complex workflows (such as batch process samples with multiple methods to various laboratories), as well as other laboratory operations, including recommending methodologies and offering references to best practices; (2) supporting single sample and batch process sample analysis work, as well as sample splitting; (3) providing online scheduling, assignment of sample analysis, and designation of analyses to be performed, as well as allowing analysts to view online their assigned samples; and (4) generating template-based reports of the results of a sample analysis. c) Sample accountability Â­ where the need exists for tracking specimens/samples, control materials and media movement into and out of storage. This function would allow the identification of the location of a specimen/sample at any step in the testing and/or process, resulting in a more efficient sample management with real-time sample tracking and automatic traceability to the appropriate laboratory groups, and laboratory analysts. d) Electronic document sharing Â­ where ORA Laboratories have a need for cohesive electronic information management to provide information more quickly internally, as well as to other federal agencies, affected states, and the general public.

LIMS IDIQ--Statement of Work
e) Work process automation and control Â­ where the LIMS solution would assist ORA Laboratories to automate the population of fields in the analytical work packages with information such as methods, analysis, various results, equipment to use, and standards to use. f) Management of inventories (chemicals, supplies, equipment, staff, etc.) Â­ where the LIMS solution would improve inventory management of such artifacts as manufacture media, reagents, stains, and other supplies and equipment required for support of the individual laboratory analytical testing activity from a variety of components that carry expiration dates. The LIMS solution would support the ORA Laboratories' staff assignment and work, based on skills, availability and workload.

g) Instrument calibration Â­ where instrument calibration ensures the laboratory equipment will work, and continue to work, as intended. The LIMS solution would support instrument calibration and recalibration in the laboratory when first used. This would include tracking instrument preventive and emergency maintenance, tracking future preventive maintenance dates, and monitoring instrument usage. h) Instrument data acquisition Â­ where the LIMS solution would make the instrument data available to the user during sample analysis. This will include backup and storage of instrument data for disaster recovery purposes. i) Asset management Â­ where the LIMS solution would assist ORA Laboratories to manage their assets such as temperature monitoring systems, laboratory specific databases, online reference material, software/hardware licenses, and software/hardware upgrade schedule. Preventive maintenance Â­ where the LIMS solution would assist ORA Laboratories to create records for each instrument and instrument method if multiple methods are used on a given instrument.

j)

k) Training planning and records Â­ where the Laboratory can manage staff training and education activities, personnel resources (including skills, education, certifications, etc.). Training and education should enable the tracking of course preparation, scheduling, attendance and follow up. Resource management includes tracking employee certifications and competency testing for each test they perform, as well as the instruments they use in testing. This planning capability includes training, documentation, and reporting necessary to maintain ORA Laboratory's certification. The training records will be maintained in the Quality Management Information System (QMIS). QMIS uses the COTS product Master Control. QMIS is being implemented and maintained under a separate contract. The LIMS solution will need to interface with the QMIS. l) Reporting, tracking and trending Â­ where the LIMS solution would support timely and efficient general laboratory reports addressing the ORA Laboratories' external obligations and internal management needs. This function should also enable appropriate statistical analysis, surveillance outputs, and reports needed internally and supplied to external partners for statistical and surveillance purposes.

m) Linking of samples Â­ where the LIMS solution would support data capture and share with other interested parties non-test specific information, allow the performing of additional testing for typing and understanding primary results, and support the performing of statistical analysis activities intended to identify suspicious test request and result patterns. For more background information please refer to the attachments titled LIMS Boundary Document and LIMS Concept of Operations (ConOps).

LIMS IDIQ--Statement of Work 1.2. Objectives
The overarching goal of the LIMS contract is to provide, integrate, support, and maintain an overall LIMS Solution that meets FDA requirements and the accomplishes the following objectives: 1. Increase the effectiveness and efficiency of laboratory resources by improving sample analysis throughput and improving support for the management of complex workflows (such as batch processing with multiple methods to various laboratories), and other laboratory operations. This includes settings for two different modes: standard mode and high throughput mode. Decrease sample turnaround time. This includes reducing the manual entry of analysis result data; increasing the efficiency and speed of analytical work package generation and distribution for batch process samples; and improving the ability to scale up production during times of workload spikes. Increase Management ability to track resources more efficiently, including Laboratory equipment, Laboratory personnel, and timeframe issues. This includes the ability to track laboratory work at the individual analysis level. Reduce the opportunity for human errors in data entry, thus improving Quality Assurance in documentation. Improve the capability to generate documentation for accountability by automatically collecting and compiling an electronic audit trail throughout the sample's life and for analytical work packages. Improve quality control by shortening the time needed to spot check critical parameters and recognize adverse trends. Improve overall trend analysis capabilities, for quality-related trends in laboratory results, for production-related matters (proficiency testing, research, inspections, training, budget, inventory, program obligations), and for performance parameters (time, cost, errors, hours, equipment out-of specifications, sample classifications, responsiveness to consumer complaints and letters). Results will be provided faster, and the accuracy of documents will be improved. Automate laboratory reporting for laboratory-internal and laboratory-external purposes. This includes automating the collection of readings from instruments and the storage of data (including readings and images) in a queryable database. It may also include storing or accessing chemical storage information to ensure adequate supplies of reagents at a testing site before a test is assigned. Reduce time and effort needed to maintain laboratory accreditation by providing the necessary checks and balances through automated tools and electronic documentation. Streamline communication of other analysis-related information and notifications to stakeholders in FDA's regulatory work processes. Improve laboratory surge capacity for routine high volume workload and during times of workload spikes. Provide technology to build necessary interfaces with internal and external equipment, systems, and databases.

Introduction
Virtual Demonstration Description

For each of the scenarios listed below, the Offeror shall assume a lab environment that is equivalent to each of the Pilot labs described in the Pilot Task Order 1. The equipment and environment for the hypothetical labs used in the scenarios are equivalent to the equipment and requirements referenced in each Lab Pilot environment. For the scenarios that involve chemistry, the Offeror shall assume that the environment is composed of chemistry equipment that is equivalent in number and complexity to the microbiology environment. During the virtual presentation, an Offeror will present with whatever equipment it brings. Any interfaces described in the scenarios will be simulated by the Offeror using pre-generated data provided by the Offeror. The presentation will take place in a standard conference room. The Offeror shall provide computers/laptops, projectors, screens, and other required equipment. No material handouts will be allowed. There will be no Internet access in the conference room. The Offeror may not bring any recording devices, but the Government may record the presentations. For the purposes of this document, the term "simulation" is understood to mean a process whereby functionality is demonstrated only using the allowed equipment for this demonstration and the Offeror's proposed software solution. For the purposes of this document, the referenced "external interfaces" are outside the scope of what will be evaluated. The demonstration may last a maximum of three (3) hours. In addition, twenty (20) minutes will be allowed for setup and an additional twenty (20) minutes for breakdown. Offerors shall demonstrate according to the provided scenarios only. If a demonstration shows all of the provided scenarios before the allotted time is completed, then the demonstration shall be concluded. For modeling the laboratories and performing the demonstration, Offerors may make use of the FDA ORA Laboratory Manual of Quality Policies (available at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/FieldScience/ucm171208.htm) and The Investigations Operations Manual (available at http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/IOM/default.htm). For Scenarios 3 and 4, Offerors shall make reference to the Form FDA 525 is on page 151 of 2011 IOM (Ref: Section 4.5.5.1 - Sample Package Identification and FDA 525) and Form FDA 484 is on page 108 of IOM 2011 (Ref: Section 4.1.1.3 - Receipt for Samples). During the presentation, the Government will not pose questions. Any questions the Government may have will be forwarded in writing to the Offeror after the presentation as discussion questions.

Scenario 1 Â­ LIMS manages user accounts, sample types, and laboratory administrative processes 1. LIMS helps define user profiles, modify privileges, and audit each user account:  Lab supervisor, QC/QA reviewer, lab Analyst, and a sample custodian. 2. LIMS supports sample types: a. Regulatory sample b. Non-regulatory sample 3. Create and modify a sample test process flow to manage a sample with the following functions: receive sample, categorize sample, accession sample, assign sample, track sample, store sample, print reports, timeframes monitoring, employee workload, and real time sample status.

2.2.

LIMS interface with lab instruments

Scenario 2 Â­ LIMS automates interface with laboratory instrument. 1. One-time data capture from Chemistry instrument - Integration of the LIMS with an HPLC-MS instrument 2. This step will simulate one analysis sequence. 3. LIMS system performs data calculations. 4. LIMS system flags hold time expirations. 5. Users are notified when testing conditions exceed limits. 6. LIMS external data integration into sample records.

2.3.

Sample workflow example

Scenario 3 Â­ LIMS manages the submission of a single item case to an ORA laboratory by an external system. The servicing laboratory depends on the Program Assignment Code (PAC) and Problem Area Flag (PAF) associated with the sample. These are unique alphanumeric codes used within FDA to define sample and analysis types (e.g. Microbiology, Chemistry, etc.). The PAC identifies the Compliance program being supported and the PAF identifies the particular analytical operation being requested. Sample PAC and PAF codes are available in the IOM (http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/Inspections/IOM/default.htm). The single item case includes: Receiving the work request from an external system in the LIMS 1. The LIMS sample number (assignment number) should be inherited from an external system. If not, the LIMS sample number must be associated with the external sample number at all steps, including sub-samples. 2. Check that the PAC of the work request corresponds to the lab services.

3. Check the PAF of the work request. PAF specifies the appropriate FDA format for documenting the analysis results. 4. Date/Time Received: mm/dd/yyyy 5. Check submitting Officer/Agency 6. Check sample package label 7. Check box on LIMS screen that sample has been submitted in sealed package. 8. Mark work package (work request and physical sample) as received. 9. Demonstrate proof of chain of custody features throughout the process. A Receipt for Samples (Form FDA 484) is retrieved from an external system or is re-generated and given to the submitting requester. Based on FDA 484 (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/Inspections/IOM/ucm127401.pdf ), this form must include the following information:  Laboratory name  Laboratory Control Number (LCN) LIMS-generated  Date/time received  Submitting agency  Submitting agency sample number  Submitting requester name  Assignment due date  Laboratory sections (Food Chemistry, Microbiology, Drug Chemistry, etc.) A printable bar code label for the work request for laboratory services is shown on a print preview screen. The label information includes, at minimum, the following information:  LCN bar code  Sample number (assignment number)  The laboratory name  PAC  PAF Verify available lab resources (sample load, analyst availability). Verify qualifications and training of the lab analysts in the laboratory (simulated). Verify equipment availability for conducting the analyses (simulate). Assign work to a lab analyst. Assignment includes procedures/methods to be used, available instruments that can be used to perform the analyses, and the due date for completion of the analyses. Notify analyst via email (simulate). When Compliance Officer marks the sample as approved for disposition, the LIMS receives the disposition assignment information from an external system (simulated). Analyst disposes of the sample and updates LIMS as such. LIMS notifies an external system of successful disposition (simulated).

Multiple workflows within one LIMS instance

Scenario 5 Â­ LIMS enables multiple workflows. A single sample of a food product may be split into multiple split samples: one for microbiological analysis, and a second for filth analysis. When a sample must be split to be used for multiple analyses, the order of the analyses must be taken into consideration. The split must be performed under sterile conditions; therefore, the LIMS should first specify in the workflow that the sample be first checked by Microbiology for split, and then the split sample would be sent to the Filth lab for analysis. Modify workflow to include split samples  Demonstrate that LIMS can modify workflow to incorporate inter/intra lab chain of custody.  Demonstrate that samples received with a unique sample identifier can be split into multiple portions, can be identified and tracked, and can be related back to the original received unique sample identifier.  Demonstrate the "intra-lab" (within one laboratory) sample portion

INFORMATION SECURITY Information Security is applicable to this solicitation and the following is provided to assist in proposal preparation. 15.1 IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS: The following information shall be addressed in a separate section of the Technical Proposal entitled, "INFORMATION SECURITY."The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-347) (FISMA) requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to safeguard information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor (including subcontractor), or other source. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued a number of publications that provide guidance in the establishment of minimum security controls for management, operational and technical safeguards needed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a Federal information system and its information. 15.2 The Statement of Work (SOW) requires the successful offeror to (1) develop, (2) have the ability to access, or (3) host and/or maintain a Federal information system(s). Pursuant to Federal and HHS Information Security Program Policies the following requirements apply to this solicitation: 15.2.1 Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), Title III, EGovernment Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347 (Dec. 17, 2002); http://csrc.nist.gov/policies/FISMA-final.pdf Information Type: [x] Mission Based Information: (b) Security Categories and Levels Confidentiality Level: [ ] Low [X] Moderate [ ] High Integrity Level: [ ] Low [ ] Moderate [X] High Availability Level: [ ] Low [ ] Moderate [X] High Overall Level: [ ] Low [X] Moderate [ ] High Position Sensitivity Designations - Prior to award, the Government will determine the position sensitivity designation for each contractor (including subcontractor) employee that the successful offeror proposes for work under the contract. For proposal preparation purposes, the following designations apply: [x] Level 5: Public Trust - Moderate Risk (Requires Suitability Determination with NACIC). Contractor employees assigned to a Level 5 position with no previous investigation and approval shall undergo a National Agency Check and Inquiry Investigation plus a Credit Check (NACIC). 15.3 Upon award, the contractor will be required to submit a roster of all staff (including subcontractor staff) working under the contract that will develop, have the ability to access, or host and/or maintain a federal information system(s). The Government will determine and notify the Contractor of the appropriate level of suitability investigation required for each staff member. An electronic template, "Roster of Employees Requiring Suitability Investigations," is available for contractor use at: http://ais.nci.nih.gov/forms/Suitability-roster.xls

13

15.4 Upon receipt of the Government's notification of applicable Suitability Investigations required, the contractor shall complete and submit the required forms within 30 days of the notification. 15.5 Contractor/subcontractor employees who have met investigative requirements within the past five years may only require an updated or upgraded investigation. 15.6 Information Security Training - HHS policy requires contractors/subcontractors receive security training commensurate with their responsibilities for performing work under the terms and conditions of their contractual agreements. 15.7 The successful offeror will be responsible for assuring that each contractor/subcontractor employee has completed the NIH Computer Security Awareness Training course at: http://irtsectraining.nih.gov/ prior to performing any contract work, and thereafter completing the NIH-specified fiscal year refresher course during the period of performance of the contract. The successful offeror shall maintain a listing of all individuals who have completed this training and shall submit this listing to the COTR. 15.8 Additional security training requirements commensurate with the position may be required as defined in NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-16/800-16.pdf). This document provides information about information security training that may be useful to potential offerors. 16. PERSONNEL SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS 16.1 BACKGROUND The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), requires that DHHS employees and contractor employees (including subcontractors) who will be working in a DHHS-owned or leased space and/or who will have access to DHHS equipment, and non-public privileged, proprietary, or trade secret information, undergo a background investigation of some type. Contractor employees who will be in DHHS-owned or lease space for less than thirty (30) days are exempted from the background investigation requirement. These contractor employees must be escorted at all time while in DHHS-owned or leased space. 16.2 GENERAL The contractor shall submit the following items to the Contracting Officer, ten (10) calendar days prior to commencement of work under this order: a. Certification that all required security form packets and a list of contractor employees names for whom the requisite security information has been provided to Division of Security Operations, Policy and Planning, Personnel Security Staff. b. "Contractor's Commitment to Protect Non-public Information Agreement" forms signed by each employee named in paragraph a. above. With the exception of costs associated with fingerprinting Contractor employees outside of the FDA Personnel Security Office, the Government will conduct all required background investigations at no cost to the contractor. The cost of fingerprinting Contractor employees at any location other than the FDA Personnel Security Office will be borne by the Contractor.

14

Contractor employees shall obtain security badges in order to access to DHHS-owned or leased property without an escort. (See Section 3 for details on the badging process) However, in the event that work must commence before security badges can be issued, contractor employees will be allowed onto DHHS-owned or leased property, but must be escorted at all times. All Contractor employees who undergo a background investigation are required to log onto the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP) system to complete the forms necessary to initiate their background investigations. The forms required vary with the position risk levels for the order. The position risk levels for this order are Level 5 There are two (2) potential position risk levels, which are: Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1) (SEE CHART A) - Positions which involve the lowest degree of adverse impact on the efficiency of the Agency. The forms set forth by CHART A are required for Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1). Contractor employees assigned to Level 1 who receive a security badge will be required to provide additional security information for a background investigation as specified in Paragraph 5 below. Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6) (SEE CHART B) - Positions in which the incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish public confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned Government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs. The forms set forth by CHART B are required for Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6). Contractor employees assigned Levels 5 or 6 must receive security badge as well as a background investigation. In order to access the e-QIP system, Contractor employees must provide the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist with the following information: (a) full name; (b) position title; (c) social security number; (d) date of birth; (e) place of birth; (f) email address; and (g) phone number. The Personnel Security Specialist will use this information to initiate each Contractor employee into the e-QIP system. Once this is done, each Contractor employee will receive an email that contains a web link to access the e-QIP system, as well as instructions and additional forms needed to initiate the suitability background investigation. The Project Officer for the order will provide the name of the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist to the Contractor. A Contractor's failure to comply with the e-QIP processing guidelines will result in that Contractor's employees being denied access to FDA property until all security processing has been completed. 16.3 BADGING PROCESS The FDA Project Officer will sponsor Contractor employees on the FDA Form 3391 for the purpose of obtaining an FDA Security Access Card. In order to obtain one, a contractor employee must receive a "favorable" fingerprint return. Fingerprints must be submitted to the Personnel Security Office at least ten (10) days prior to the commencement of work. Fingerprints will be submitted in one of two ways, depending on where the order will be performed: Contractor employees who will work in the Washington D.C. metro area will, at the direction of the FDA Project Officer or his/her designee, contact the Personnel Security Branch to schedule a fingerprinting appointment, or

15

Contractor employees who will work in a field office will submit fingerprints to: Food and Drug Administration OSO/Office of Security Operations Attn: Personnel Security Staff 10903 New Hampshire Ave, RM 1201 Silver Spring, MD 20993 Phone: (301) 796-4592 Upon the receipt of a "favorable" fingerprint return, each Contractor employee must present two forms of identification in order to receive his or her badge. One form of identification must be a government-issued photo identification document. Acceptable forms of photo identification are referenced on the FDA Form 3391. Acceptable forms of secondary identification are listed on the back of the I-9 Form. This form can be obtained at http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/files/i-9.pdf An individual who receives an unfavorable report may appeal that finding by submitting a written request to the Personnel Security Staff. 16.4 BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS The Government shall conduct an additional background investigation for those individuals named to risk Levels 5 and 6 serving under this order. Required background investigations may include, but not be limited to: Review of prior Government/military personnel records; Review of FBI records and fingerprint files; Searches of credit bureaus; Personal interviews; and Written inquiries covering the subject's background. Background investigations will be conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that the integrity of order performance is maintained pending completion of all appropriate background investigations of contractor employees. The Contractor shall submit the information required for eQIP access and other requisite forms for the risk level(s) specified. In addition, the contractor shall provide a cover letter which includes: the Contractor's name, the order number, the name of the Contracting Officer administering the order, the names of all Contractor employees' for whom a background check is required and those employees' social security numbers, dates of birth, and former names. This cover letter and all completed forms shall be transmitted, in a separate sealed envelope marked, "TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY," to: Food and Drug Administration OSO/Office of Security Operations Attn: Personnel Security Staff 10903 New Hampshire Ave, RM 1201 Silver Spring, MD 20993 Phone: (301) 796-4592

16

The contractor shall send a separate letter to the Contracting Officer that includes the order number and employee names. The contractor shall advise its prospective employees that all standard forms submitted to the FDA will be forwarded to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for scheduling background investigations. Personnel Security Staff will resolve with the order employee any issues arising out of inaccurate or incomplete forms. Employees who have been previously granted a Government security clearance shall advise Personnel Security Staff of the details of such clearances to determine if a previous clearance level is suitable for the current FDA position. At any time, if a contractor employee for whom security forms have been submitted is terminated or otherwise ceases work under the order, the contractor shall immediately notify Personnel Security Staff, in writing, with copies to the respective FDA Project and Contracting Officers. The OPM background investigation will take approximately 120 days. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing if an employee is denied a clearance. Those individuals who have been cleared by Personnel Security Staff may continue to work under the order. Those who are not cleared must cease work on the order immediately. If a Contractor employee changes job responsibilities under this order, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, and the Government will make a determination whether an additional security clearance is required. In the event that a cleared individual is replaced, the contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer and comply with all requirements of this clause, as specified herein, prior to the commencement of work by the replacement individual. The Contractor shall be responsible for the return of any Government issued security badges to the Project Officer. 16.5 PERSONNEL SECURITY CHARTS CHART A Mandatory for all on-site contract employees

The independent Contractor shall hereafter be referred to as the "Escrowee" and the agreement under which assignment is made shall hereafter be referred to as the "Agreement." As used in this clause, the terms "escrow" and the "escrowee" are used for purposes of convenient reference only and are not intended to define the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties. The Escrowee shall be an institution or entity that routinely engages in the practice of holding software source code for the benefit of third parties licensed to use the related object code or software programs. The Escrowee shall be financially and operationally independent of the Contractor, including the Contractor's parent company, subcontractors, subsidiaries, and affiliates. 2) Within ten (10) calendar days from the Contractor's first delivery of software to FDA, or within ten (10) calendar days from the delivery of changed or updated software to FDA, the Contractor shall deliver to the Escrowee one (1) copy of the related source code materials.

The Agreement, all undertakings of which will be borne at the expense of the Contractor, shall provide as a minimum: 1) The paramount purpose of the Agreement is to ensure the adequate performance of the (software application(s) name(s) to be inserted as applicable) for the benefit of the United States; 2) Within ten (10) calendar days from the Contractor's first delivery of software to FDA, or within ten (10) calendar days from the delivery of changed or updated software to FDA, the Contractor shall assign and deliver to the Escrowee one (1) copy of the related source code material unless the source code material is to be made available to FDA directly; 3) The Contractor warrants to the Escrowee that the source code material developed is complete, accurate, and current; 4) The Escrowee will not use the source code and, except upon a condition of default or in audit as described below, will reveal it to no other person or entity; 5) The Escrowee will destroy the source code material upon notification from FDA that the related software is no longer in use, provide a certificate of destruction to FDA, and that under no condition will the source code material be returned to the Contractor; 6) The Contractor will provide to the Escrowee and FDA monthly reports detailing the changes made to the software provided to FDA (negative reports are required), and these reports shall be so detailed as to give the information necessary to verify that the source code material delivered to the Escrowee and the software delivered to the Government are consistent; 7) FDA is authorized to audit (but not copy) four (4) times per year, the source code material and reports, by sampling, at the location of the Escrowee to verify that the source code material is current; 8) The Escrowee shall surrender to FDA source code material in its possession for software that is determined by the Contracting Officer to be operating beneath the standard of performance set forth in this contract, and for which the Contractor has been determined to be in default by the Contracting Officer and notified of a partial or total termination for default; such surrender to be made within ten (10) calendar days of the Contracting Officer's written request, provided the request states that use of the source code material is necessary to return the software to an acceptable level of performance and attaches documentation sufficient to establish the other conditions set forth in this contract. 9) FDA, as a result of audit, or after delivery upon a condition of default and notwithstanding its legal and equitable title in the copy of source code material thus delivered, will use the source code only to perfect operation of the related software and will disclose it to no other person or entity, except as is necessary to perfect operation of the related software, and then only upon conditions of non-disclosure for any other purpose to third parties; 10)The Agreement is not intended to establish a right or benefit in any successor in interest to the licensor unless specifically approved by the Government; 11)While conditions for surrender of the source code material from the Escrowee to FDA may be established by reference to conditions of performance under the LIMS system being acquired or developed, the obligations of the Escrowee to FDA under the Agreement will survive any termination, cancellation, or repudiation of the LIMS system being acquired or developed; and, 12)The terms of the Agreement are not intended to provide FDA with a copyright in the software or to interfere with the rights in data established under the (system(s) name(s) to be inserted on a task order-by-task order basis) being acquired or developed.

21

d) Escrow Waiver: The requirement to assign and deliver source code material to an independent Contractor under an "Escrow Agreement" may be waived, whether in whole or in part, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer upon the written request of the Contractor. Specific items for which waiver is granted shall expressly be identified in this contract. In granting a request for waiver, in whole or part, the Contracting Officer may consider any fact found relevant to exercising informed discretion, including, but, not limited to, any or all of the following: 1) The extent of the Contractor's (and its subcontractor's) experience in supporting and maintaining software on projects of similar or larger scope and dollar value; 2) The sufficiency and quality of the Contractor's past performance and that of its subcontractors; and 3) The market strength and influence of the Contractor, its subcontractors, and any involved software suppliers." e) Disputes: A dispute between the Contractor and FDA relating to the obligations of the parties to the "Escrow Agreement" shall be resolved in accordance the Disputes clause under FAR 52.212-4 "Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items" of this contract. 19. ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI) 19.1 The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information. 19.2 A potential conflict of interest would include a situation when the Contractor or subcontractors have business, financial, or other interests, as well as professional activities that create conflicting roles which could potentially bias a Contractor's judgment or result in unfair competitive advantage to the Contractor and thus impede the Government's objective of obtaining impartial, technically sound, and objective performance of the contract. 19.3 Prior to the commencement of any work, the Contractor agrees to notify the CO that to the best of its knowledge and belief, no actual or potential conflict of interest exists or to identify to the CO any actual or potential conflict of interest the firm may have. 19.4 The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest is identified during performance, the Contractor will immediately make a full disclosure, in writing to the CO. This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the CO to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict of interest. 19.5 Remedies- The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential organizational conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose it; or misrepresented relevant information to the CO, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. 19.6 The Contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph in all subcontracts and consultant agreements provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph, unless otherwise authorized by the CO.

22

19.7 The CO's decision as to the existence or nonexistence of an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest shall be final. 19.8 The contractor employee may be required to sign a conflict of interest certification if the Contracting Officer determines the contract and associated work may potentially affect the employee's or the employer's financial interest. When the Contracting Officer determines the potential exists, the contractor employees, through the contract Program Manager, shall be required to sign the attached Conflict of Interest Certification. 20.

Where an action against the Contractor is not covered by a policy of insurance, the Contractor shall, with the approval of the Contracting Officer, proceed with the defense of the action in good faith. The Government shall not be liable for the expense of defending any action or for any costs resulting from the loss thereof to the extent that the Contractor would have been compensated by insurance which was required by law or regulation or by written direction of the Contracting Officer, but which the Contractor failed to secure through its own fault or negligence. In any event, unless otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the Government shall not reimburse or indemnify the Contractor for any liability loss, cost, or expense, which the Contractor may incur or be subject to by reason of any loss, injury or damage, to the person or to real or personal property of any third parties as may accrue during, or arise from, the performance of this contract. (End of clause) HHSAR 352.242-70 KEY PERSONNEL (January 2006) The key personnel specified in this contract are considered to be essential to work performance.

(End of clause) HHSAR 352.242-73 WITHHOLDING OF CONTRACT PAYMENTS (January 2006) Notwithstanding any other payment provisions of this contract, failure of the Contractor to submit required reports when due or failure to perform or deliver required work, supplies, or services, may result in the withholding of payments under this contract unless such failure arises out of causes beyond the control, and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor as defined by the clause entitled ``Excusable Delays'' or ``Default,'' as applicable. The Government will

36

immediately notify the Contractor of its intention to withhold payment of any invoice or voucher submitted. (End of clause) HHSAR 352.242-74 FINAL DECISIONS ON AUDIT FINDINGS Findings (April 1984) For the purpose of issuing final decisions under the Disputes clause of this contract concerning monetary audit findings, the Contracting Officer is the individual authorized to make such decisions. (End of clause) 352.239-73 ELECTRONIC INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY ACCESIBILITY (January 2010) (a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR Part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit-(1) Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and (2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. (b) Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm. (c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability Web site (http://www.hhs.gov/od). (d) Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 accessibility standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government--i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance

37

specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense. (End of provision) LIST OF ATTACHMENTS: See Content Summary Document

(3) Contents of Proposal: Offers shall include the following information: (A) CONTENTS OF VOLUME I - TECHNICAL (1) FACTOR 1 (SECTION A): TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING AND APPROACH (a) SECTION A Â­ IDIQ TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING AND APPROACH The technical understanding and approach must demonstrate an understanding of and an ability to comply with all requirements covered in the solicitation. General statements that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or paraphrases of the RFP's Statement of Work/Specification in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance. Failure to conform to any of the requirements of the RFP may deem the proposal not responsive and may form the basis for rejection of the proposal. The offeror's submitted project plan shall also be used by the Government to evaluate this factor. The offeror shall describe its overall understanding of and approach to the type of service that the offeror would expect to deliver and perform as a result of the award of this contract. In particular, the offeror's Technical Understanding and Approach should address the following: i. The offeror shall demonstrate the sufficiency of its proposed LIMS Solution to meet the FDA's mandatory LIMS business, technical, and security requirements by completing the LIMS Mandatory Requirements Checklist in Attachment 41. The offeror shall also demonstrate its ability to meet the requirements described in IDIQ Statement of Work section 4 "LIMS COTS Software." The offeror shall provide a narrative description of the offeror's approach to performing the work described in the Task Areas of the IDIQ SOW. The narrative shall describe the offeror's understanding of the LIMS project (from both a business and technical standpoint), how the offeror intends to satisfy the technical requirements, any risks it foresees in carrying out its approach, and the mitigation strategies it plans to employ for those risks. The offeror shall demonstrate how similar risks and mitigation strategies were executed in similar work under other contracts. In addition, the offeror's narrative shall convey its understanding of the nature and function of the FDA/ORA laboratories, including strategies for not interrupting or negatively impacting laboratory work during the assessment, pilot, and implementation phases, as well as the functional and data requirements of the FDA. The offeror shall provide a narrative description of the offeror's approach to implementing the LIMS Solution to support the laboratories' primary functions and link the 14 static and 2 mobile ORA laboratories. The narrative should demonstrate the offeror's understanding of the project and the challenges that the offeror envisions, as well as proposed strategies for overcoming those challenges. As each FDA/ORA laboratory provides different functions, the narrative should reflect the degree of convertibility and adaptability of the proposed solution across different technological and

ii.

iii.

41

methodological scenarios. This shall include a discussion of laboratory instrumentation integration and support. iv. The offeror shall provide a narrative description of the means by which the proposed LIMS solution will integrate with other FDA/ORA IT systems. The attached document (LIMS Solution Conceptual Architecture, Products, SOA) describes ORA's conceptual and preferred approaches toward a LIMS solution. If the offeror's proposed solution employs approaches other than those listed in the attachment, the offeror shall provide additional justification of its recommendation. The offeror's narrative shall discuss how the LIMS Solution will support the FDA regulatory processes outlined in the attached documents (refer to the Business Requirements Document (BRD), System Requirements Specification (SRS), and Requirements Tracking Matrix (RTM)) and discuss the interfaces the proposed solution will use. This shall include work flows outside of the laboratories, such as integration with MARCS components for sample collection and compliance activities. This narrative shall also discuss, again at a high level, how to best leverage the use of other ORA IT investments and assess the continued use of other software packages currently in use in ORA laboratories.

(2) FACTOR 2 (SECTION B): TASK ORDERS' TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING AND APPROACH Offerors are REQUIRED to submit a proposal for each task order. Offerors that fail to submit a proposal for each task order will be excluded from the competition without further consideration. Offerors are reminded of the page limitations listed in section vi above per task order. Task order business proposals (i.e. pricing) shall be included in Volume II and prepared in accordance with the instructions in Part C of this clause described under "CONTENTS OF VOLUME II SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS." Under no circumstances shall pricing information be included in each task order technical proposal. (a) SECTION B.1 Â­ TASK ORDER 1 TECHNICAL PROPOSAL The Offeror shall provide a narrative description of the Offeror's approach to performing the work described in the SOW. The narrative should describe the Offeror's understanding of the project (from both a business and technical standpoint), how the Offeror intends to satisfy the technical requirements, assumptions, any risks it foresees in carrying out its approach, and mitigation strategies for those risks.

11. The list may include contracts/orders on which the Offeror served as a subcontractor, provided that the subcontract was similar in scope, duration, and price to this effort. 12. If a subcontract is being used as a past performance reference, contact information for the prime contractor, not the customer, should be included. In addition, the offeror should provide one example (with reference contact information) of corporate experience that demonstrates how the corporation responded when a project went off track, either over budget, behind schedule, below quality standards or some other difficulty. (C) CONTENTS OF VOLUME II - SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS (1) Section A - SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS Â­ Original Only Subsection 1: Â­ Proposal Cover Letter. The following information shall be provided on the proposal cover letter: a) Offerors shall provide a concise statement of why they think they are the best value to the Government. b) Authorized Offeror Personnel: Provide the name, title, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address of the company/division point of contact regarding source selection decisions made with respect to your proposal and who can obligate your company contractually. Also, identify those individuals authorized to negotiate with the Government. c) Company/Division Street Address: Provide company/division's street address, county and facility code; DUNS number, TIN number, and size of business for all members of the offeror's proposed team. d) Confirmation of active registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Subsection 2 - Contract Forms Â­ Original Documents acknowledging all amendments (if applicable) including form SF-LLL "Disclosure of Lobbying Activities" (attachment 9). Subsection 3 - Representation and Certifications Â­ The offeror may state it has a current On-Line Representations and Certifications (ORCA) entry rather than submitting a complete Representations and Certifications section. It is the responsibility of the offeror to ensure the data contained in the ORCA database is accurate as required by FAR 52.212-83. Subsection 4 - Exceptions to RFP (Contractors are to clearly detail any exceptions taken and the rationale for the exceptions taken to the RFP in this section) Subsection 5 Â­ Organizational Conflict of Interest Statement Â­ The offeror shall submit a statement addressing any potential issues described in section 19 of this solicitation.

45

(2) SECTION B - PRICE. All information relating to price shall be included in the offeror's proposal (including pricing proposals for each task order). Data contained in the price proposal shall be consistent with data contained in Volumes I and II. Offerors shall submit the following: a) Completed Attachment 2 (Pricing Sheet). Offerors are to propose fully burdened rates inclusive of profit. b) Proposed Labor Rates and Hours. The supplemental pricing spreadsheet (Attachment 2) displays the Government's estimate of labor hours and labor categories required for the complete performance of the potential award including all task orders issued with this solicitation. However, the Government cannot guarantee the estimated quantities of labor hours shown for individual labor categories nor the total estimated staff hours. Although the Labor Category titles and descriptions used in this solicitation and/or Attachment 2 may not match the titles used by a particular firm, offerors shall ONLY use those labor categories listed in Attachment 4 when submitting a proposal. The quantities of labor hours for each labor category shown in the Attachment 2 shall be used by the offeror for computing total labor costs for this solicitation. The offeror shall provide a breakdown of the labor hours, labor rates and labor categories for all contract years using the electronic pricing spreadsheet. In order for the Government to evaluate the pricing of all proposals consistently in this environment, the pricing sheet assumes that the offeror performs all of the estimated IDIQ labor hours in attachment 2. This assumption is for evaluation purposes only as the actual number of hours performed under the award may differ. c) Pricing Instructions. The Offeror shall use the attached pricing spreadsheet (attachment 2) for the submission of its pricing proposal. The Offeror shall provide supportive narratives to explain where a data field in the pricing template is left blank or has a $0 price. The Offeror shall clearly note all available discounts including but not limited to volume and corporate discounts. Where cost or pricing data was derived or estimated, the Offeror must show formulas that are clearly visible in the individual cells and verifiable. The Offeror may link cells between worksheets or workbooks on the condition that all linked reference files are submitted with the task order proposal. The workbooks must not contain any macros or hidden cells. The FDA will not accept pasted values where formulas must be shown; if the Offeror employs pasted values under these circumstances, this may delay the Offeror's proposal evaluation. The FDA reserves the right to verify and validate any, part or all proposed prices including direct cost. The Offeror shall make readily available all supporting pricing data used in the derivation of their proposed prices should the FDA elect to do so. In addition, the FDA reserves the right to negotiate, any, part or all of the proposed prices prior to the award decision. The purpose of the FDA pricing spreadsheet is to ensure consistency and transparency in the derivation of the Offeror's proposed pricing. This requires the Offeror to show the break out of the cost elements used in the derivation of their proposed pricing wherever applicable. In other words, for each corresponding pricing worksheet contained in the FDA pricing proposal spreadsheet, the Offeror shall clearly list the CLINs or the cost elements that derive or make up the total proposed price for the specified tasks.

46

For example, for the proposed pricing of Task Order 1, the Offeror shall clearly list all labor categories necessary to provide the overall project support throughout the performance period as described in the period of performance section of the task order SOW. Table - Sample Pricing

Note: Pricing data shown is for illustration purposes only A sample pricing proposal is shown in the above table for illustration purposes. As noted, all pricing data shown is for illustration purposes only. Let's assume that Offeror A proposes the above labor categories and the corresponding level of efforts (LOEs) for the Project Management Support task as described in SOW Section 4.7. Offeror A's proposed pricing represents the following: Ë The 6 labor categories, e.g., Project Manager, Quality Assurance Manager, etc., represent the labor mix with the skill sets necessary to support this Task Ë For all 6 labor categories, Offeror A is offering an additional 10% discount off their IDIQ pricing schedule (Discounts are highly encouraged) Ë Offeror's A annual labor hours are 2,000 Ë Offeror A is proposing 5.0 FTEs to support this Task Ë Task 1 total firm fixed price (FFP) for contract year 1 is $941,760 The FDA pricing spreadsheet requires the Offeror to submit the LOE (in annual hours) as well as the full-time equivalent (FTE) for any proposed labor category. The Offeror shall assume 2,000 hours to be the annual amount for an FTE. The Offeror may leave blank or propose $0 where pricing may not be applicable to any specific LOE pricing as long as they are supported by clear pricing narratives or assumptions. For all other tasks, the Offeror may also leave blank or propose $0 for any pricing year beyond contract year 1 where the LOE pricing for a specific activity may not be necessary or applicable. Task Order 1 shall be priced as Time & Materials and Task Order 2 shall be priced as firm-fixedprice (FFP). The Offeror shall propose pricing for all task orders similarly to the sample pricing shown in Table 1. As noted, Task Order 1 is Time & Materials contract type and Task Order 2 is FFP contract type. The appropriate contract type for each subsequent task order will be stated when they are issued. FDA will evaluate these future task orders in accordance with attachment 2, using the IDIQ designated tabs (IDIQ Â­ Contractor Site, IDIQ Â­ Government Site). The hours in attachment 2 under the IDIQ-Contractor Site and IDIQ- Government Site tabs represent a predetermined Government estimate of the number of hours required for all IDIQ-related work (excluding task orders 1 and 2) for the 5 year life of this contract. The Offeror is required to complete the IDIQ Â­ Contractor Site and IDIQ Â­ Government Site tabs using the estimated number of hours per labor category. In addition to the proposed pricing to support the specified requirements, the Government has provided in Attachment 2 the estimated total cost of Other Direct Costs (ODC) and Travel for each contract period. The offeror shall incorporate these estimates into its overall pricing proposal.

(End of provision) 52.212-2 1. EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

EVALUATION OF OFFERS (SINGLE AWARD)

An offeror must offer on all items in this solicitation to be eligible for award. 2. EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD (BEST VALUE) (a) Basis for Award. The Government will award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror. The Government also reserves the right to award a contract based upon initial offers. (b) General. In order to determine the offer providing the best value, the following factors and subfactors will be considered: Factor I: Factor II: IDIQ Technical Understanding and Approach(Volume I) Task Orders' Technical Understanding and Approach (Volume I) Subfactor 1 Â­ Task Order 1 Technical Proposal (All tasks) Subfactor 2 Â­ Task Order 2 Technical Proposal (Only O&M task) Management Approach (Volume I) Subfactor 1 Â­ Management Approach/Organizational Structure Subfactor 2 Â­ Recruitment/Staffing Plan Subfactor 3 Â­ Task Order 2 Management Proposal (PMTC Task) Qualifications of Key Personnel Â­ IDIQ (Volume I) Subfactor 1 Â­ Resumes & Letters of Commitment Relevant Experience (Volume I)

Factor III:

Factor IV: Factor V:

Risk Assessment: Past Performance (Volume II) (1) Factors (IDIQ Technical Understanding and Approach, Task Orders' Technical Understanding and Approach, Management Approach, Qualifications of Key Personnel-IDIQ and Relevant Experience are listed in descending order of importance. Task Orders' Technical Understanding and Approach Subfactors 1 and 2 are listed in descending order of importance within the Task Orders' Technical Understanding and Approach factor. Management Approach Subfactors 1, 2 and 3 are equal in importance within the Management Approach factor. The nonprice factors, when combined, are approximately equal to Price.

53

(2) Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals, nor does the importance of price bear a linear relationship to the technical proposal. The importance of price in the evaluation for award will increase with the degree of equality in the non-price factors of the proposals. (c) Factor I: IDIQ Technical Understanding and Approach. The technical proposal will be evaluated to assess the offeror's understanding of the scope of the work and its overall approach to providing the required services in the IDIQ contract. The Government will use an adjectival rating for this overall technical evaluation. The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed technical approach (to include the proposed project plan) to achieving the requirements of the IDIQ statement of work. Special emphasis will be placed on the following: i. The sufficiency of the offeror's proposed LIMS Solution, including the requirements in IDIQ Statement of Work section 4 "LIMS COTS Software", and its capacity to meet the mandatory business, technical, and security requirements detailed in the LIMS Mandatory Requirements Checklist. The offeror's demonstrated understanding of and approach to the Task Areas set forth in the IDIQ Statement of Work (Task Areas 5.1 through 5.5) including its demonstrated ability to satisfy LIMS technical requirements; its identification of and plans to mitigate associated risks; its strategies for preventing negative impact and interruptions of laboratory work during the assessment, pilot, and implementation phases; its approach to the LIMS integration with laboratory instruments, and its understanding of the functional and data requirements of the FDA. The offeror's demonstrated understanding of the FDA lab environment and regulatory processes, and the practicality of its approach to implementing the LIMS Solution to support the laboratories' primary functions and diverse configurations, and to link the 14 static and 2 mobile ORA laboratories. The offeror's demonstrated understanding of the requirements for and approach to integrating the LIMS Solution with other critical FDA/ORA IT systems including the offeror's approach to address FDA's current Enterprise Architecture and SOA environment. The content and completeness of the overall technical approach and responsiveness to the requirements identified in the RFP.

(d) Factor II: Task Orders' Technical Approach. The Government will evaluate the offeror's technical understanding of task order 1 and task order 2's scopes of work, and its overall approach to providing the required services in both task orders. The Government will use an adjectival rating for this overall factor evaluation. This rating will be derived from the adjectival rating for each Task Order technical proposal. As such, the overall adjectival rating for Factor II will be a direct conformation of the adjectival ratings from both the Task Order 1 technical proposal and Task Order 2 technical proposal (O&M task) subfactors.

54

Each offeror will be evaluated on the following four factors. The evaluation results of these factors will contribute to the offeror's overall Task Orders' Technical Approach evaluation. i. The offeror will be evaluated on its understanding of task order requirements; identification of risks and associated plans to mitigate them; the realism of its proposed schedules including strategies for not interrupting or negatively impacting laboratory work during the assessment, pilot, and implementation phases; and methods proposed to keep the Government informed of the project status and deliverables. The offeror will be evaluated on its proposed processes to analyze and validate LIMS requirements; perform assessments of critical components of the LIMS Solution; and create a realistic design and roadmap for the LIMS implementation. The offeror will be evaluated on its approach to implementing LIMS pilots at NRL and DEN that demonstrate the offeror's understanding of the need to support the laboratories' primary functions while satisfying the broader LIMS requirement of linking the 14 static and 2 mobile ORA laboratories - including the degree of convertibility and adaptability of the offeror's proposed solution across the different technological and methodological scenarios. The offeror will be evaluated on its ability to demonstrate that the proposed staff, Key Personnel, labor categories and man-hours per labor category are appropriate to meet the requirements and provide a technical solution.

(e) Factor III: Management Approach. The Government will evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the offeror's comprehensive approach to managing all aspects of contract performance and administration. In addition, the offeror will be evaluated on its management approach for the PMTC task under Task Order 2. Management Approach consists of three (3) subfactors, which shall be weighted in descending order of importance: Management Approach/Organizational Structure, Effective Recruitment Plan and Task Order 2 PMTC Task management approach proposal. (1) Subfactor 1 Â­ Management Approach/Organizational Structure. The Government will evaluate the extent to which the offeror's proposal demonstrates a comprehensive and effective management approach to ensure the accomplishment of the FDA objectives. This includes the level to which the proposal includes: 1) an appropriate and efficient management approach and organizational structure to effectively provide the services required by this solicitation and manage multiple task orders simultaneously; 2) mitigation of the performance risks; 3) a Program Manager to effectively manage the program requirements; and 4) the organization structure to manage this program.. (2) Subfactor 2 Â­ Recruitment/Staffing Plan. The Government will evaluate the extent to which the offeror's proposal sets forth a recruitment plan that is likely to result in the Offeror being able to staff task orders with qualified professions in a timely manner. The Government will evaluate the offeror's submitted Task Mapping Matrix (Attachment 6). Specifically the Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed staffing plan for each task order, of which the Task Mapping Matrix shall display proposed personnel for each task order. The FDA will also consider the extent to which recruitment plan is likely to ensure compliance with FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.

55

(3) Subfactor 3 Â­ Task Order 2 PMTC Task Management Approach. The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed management approach for executing the work described under task 2.1 of task order 2. In particular, the Government will evaluate the proposed approach for management of work/tasks across both task orders and how performance of the required tasks will be coordinated and tracked under PMTC. (f) Factor IV: Qualifications of Key Personnel - IDIQ. The FDA will evaluate the extent to which the key personnel have demonstrated the technical expertise and experience necessary to successfully perform a contract, and task orders, of the magnitude described in this solicitation. This factor shall only apply to the key personnel proposed on the IDIQ contract, not the task orders. (1) Subfactor 1 Â­ Resumes & Letters of Commitment. The key personnel shall be evaluated against the general and specialized experience requirements for each key position identified in the offeror's RFP. The resumes will be evaluated on the extent that the proposed key personnel possess the demonstrated skills, experience and qualifications for this effort. (g) Factor V: Relevant Experience. The Government will evaluate the extent to which the offeror's proposal demonstrates the success of efforts on current and previous contracts, which are relevant to the IDIQ Statement of Work in terms of type, scope, complexity, and size. A highly rated proposal will provide relevant experiences from the areas required and will demonstrate a similarity to work to be performed under this effort. The highly rated proposal will also demonstrate the offerors ability to overcome difficulties encountered during performance with minimum impact to the program. (f) Past Performance. The Government will evaluate past performance as a risk assessment; not as a weighted technical evaluation factor. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offer. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. If the performance information contains negative information on which the offeror has not previously been given an opportunity to comment, FDA will provide the offeror an opportunity to comment on it priori to its consideration in the evaluation, and any offeror comment will be considered with the negative performance information. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance.

56

The lack of a past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. (g) Price - Offerors shall be evaluated on price, as shown in the submitted pricing sheet (See Attachment 2). This evaluation shall include the base period of performance as well as all optional periods. Additionally, offerors shall be evaluated in regards to the realism and reasonableness of the proposed price to the Government. The purpose of the price evaluation is to determine whether an offeror's proposed price is reasonable, realistic, and complete in relation to the solicitation and the offeror's technical proposal. Unrealistically low (or high) pricing, in the initial or revised proposal, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement, or has made an unrealistic proposal. The Government will evaluate offers, for award purposes, by adding the total price for all contract periods. 3. UNREASONABLY LOW HOURLY RATES/RISK ASSESSMENT Unrealistic rates will be considered in the risk management and may result in a reduced technical score. Discussions may be held with offerors proposing unrealistically low rates (if the offeror is in the competitive range) and such offerors will be required to: (a) Demonstrate an understanding of the requirement for which unrealistically low rates are proposed; (b) Address the ability to provide the caliber of labor required; (c) Understand that the Government fully expects to order the effort under the low priced rate categories and that the offeror's performance will be carefully assessed to ensure that the appropriate caliber of support is provided. 4. FFRDC EVALUATION SUPPORT Offerors are hereby notified that the Government intends to use support of a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) contractor to assist in the evaluation process for this solicitation. The FFRDC contractor shall follow established standards of conduct during the source selection process and shall maintain confidentiality of proprietary and source selection information.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

67

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Â§6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Â§6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Introduction

1.1. Background
The Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) Laboratory Assessment and Laboratory Pilots (LALP) Task Order is the vehicle for building the management framework necessary to achieve the objectives of the LIMS contract.

1.2. Objectives
The purpose of this Task Order is to provide an assessment of all the ORA laboratories (base task), produce a pilot in one laboratory (base task), and a pilot in a second laboratory (optional task). As the LIMS solution will require configuration to accommodate different business processes and lab instruments particular to individual FDA laboratories and will require integration with other FDA systems, some custom development is likely to be required. This Task Order, thus, includes the following activities: Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Coordination of activities with FDA OIM and FDA business units and other Contractors; Recommending network and firewall configurations; Recommending server architecture to support data, application, and web tiers; Security requirements identification and management; LIMS Requirements analysis and management; Business process modeling; Workflow process documentation; LIMS Solution design; LIMS design reviews (i.e. preliminary design); Decision Analysis Result (DAR) Reports; Integration assessments; Detailed LIMS Roadmap; Integration of the LIMS and any commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products with FDA enterprise systems to form a LIMS solution; LIMS configuration; Custom development; System testing (functional testing, unit testing, system testing, integration testing, and useracceptance testing); Develop Pilot(s) to help prove technical concepts; Providing LIMS Pilots with integration to lab instruments; Deployment planning for Pilot(s); and Implementation of Pilot(s).

In addition, activities under this Task Order shall promote operational efficiencies and avoid schedule and resource conflicts, especially during the assessment.

1.3. Scope
The overarching goal of this Task Order is to provide an overall LIMS solution that is to be piloted in two of the ORA laboratories and then implemented at all ORA laboratories. This includes all the associated services listed in Section 2. This Task Order is Time and Materials (T&M) per contract section 1. The scope of this Task Order is to 1. Conduct a Laboratory Assessment, which includes the necessary activities to plan for and design the implementations for all of the ORA laboratories (base task).

Page 3 of 25

LIMS Laboratory Assessment and Pilots--Statement of Work

2. Execute Laboratory Pilot 1, which includes procuring LIMS licenses and software and producing a Pilot in one ORA laboratory (base task). 3. Execute Laboratory Pilot 2, which includes procuring LIMS licenses and software and producing a Pilot in a second ORA laboratory (optional task). The Laboratory Assessment includes the activities listed in Section 2.1. The Pilot or Pilots will be limited to the Microbiology discipline and will show functionality in the areas listed in Section 2.2 and 2.3 below. The results of the Pilot(s) will be used by FDA as inputs into determining whether or not to exercise the following option year and continue development of the LIMS solution with the Contractor. The laboratory in which the first pilot (base task) will be implemented is the Northeast Regional Laboratory (NRL). Basic information on NRL follows. NRL, which is located in Jamaica, NY, is one of the FDA's largest field laboratories. Its staff of scientists is responsible for performing laboratory analysis of the domestic and imported products regulated by the agency. To support this effort, the laboratory maintains strong programs in regulatory methods development research and technical training. The laboratory is accredited by A2LA for technical competence in Chemical and Biological testing in accordance with the recognized international standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 General Requirements for the Competence of testing and Calibration Laboratories. The laboratory is organized into three sections: Drug Chemistry Branch, Food Chemistry Branch and Microbiological Sciences Branch. The testing performed includes analysis for microbial pathogens, pesticides, food additives, mycotoxins, colors, insanitation, decomposition and heavy metals in foods, and quality and purity in pharmaceuticals. The NRL is especially well-equipped. Its array of instrumentation includes highly sophisticated equipment, including a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer with microscopic capabilities and a gas chromatographic interface, a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, mass spectrometers including ICP/MS, LC/MS, GC/MS ion trap and quadrupole and automated microbial screening and identification systems. The laboratory staff in NRL comprises 128 individuals, all of whom will potentially have access to the LIMS Pilot. The laboratory for the second (optional task) pilot is the Denver District Laboratory, Denver, CO (DEN). Basic information about DEN follows. The Denver Laboratory is co-located with the Animal Drugs Research Center at the Denver Federal Center (DFC) in Denver Colorado. The Denver Laboratory was the first FDA laboratory to be nationally accredited by ISO 17025 standards. It is a member of the Food Emergency Response Network (FERN), a national system of laboratories dedicated to the security of the nation's food supply and able to respond in the event of a terrorist attack. Additionally, Denver contains a Biosafety Laboratory (BSL), inspected and certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and designed for the isolation of bioterrorism generated Select Agents such as anthrax and botulism. The Denver District Laboratory is a full service laboratory that tests pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and a wide variety of foods and animal feeds (domestic and imported) for dangerous and illegal analytes such as pathogens (e.g. Salmonella, E.coli), drug residues (e.g. antibiotics), and food additives, using a variety of microbiological and chemical methods. The laboratory consists of seven groups, the Animal Drugs Research Center (ADRC), two Veterinary Drug Sections, one General Chemistry Section and three Microbiology Sections. The Denver District Laboratory has a total staff of 64 employees with 20 chemists (including 3 GS-13 Specialists), 26 microbiologists (including 4 GS-13 specialists), a science advisor, one electronics specialist, management, and support staff.

Depending on contract value, the following EV reports will be required each reporting month (this is Tier 1): The Contractor shall submit CPR 1-5 on the first business day of each month. 1. CPR Â­ The CPR includes current period data as well as cumulative to date data, and is appropriate for high value, high risk contracts, and is delivered monthly. There are five formats for the CPR: A. Format 1 provides earned values, scheduled values, and actual values at the WBS level. B. Format 2 provides the same data but is grouped by functional type (e.g., Engineering, Systems Integration), rather than by the WBS. C. Format 3 provides baseline information only, it tracks changes to the baseline throughout the contract's period of performance. D. Format 4 is a Manpower Loading Report. It excludes cost data and focuses on current and future staffing levels. E. Format 5 is a Problem Analysis Reports/Variance Narratives. This format provides explanations for cost and schedule variances that have exceeded threshold. It provides a written explanation as to why the variance occurred, as well as written descriptions on how the Contractor plans to resolve the cause of the variance. 2. Cost Schedule Status Report (C/SSR) Â­ The C/SSR is similar to the CPR in that it provides earned value, scheduled value, and actual cost value at the WBS level. However, the C/SSR only reports cumulative to date information and it is delivered monthly. 3. Contract Funds Status Report (CFSR) Â­ The CFSR provides insight into the funding requirements of the program. It is reconciled to either the C/SSR or the CPR. The CFSR is a quarterly report, and will be required for all Contractors producing either a CPR or a C/SSR. 4. Contractors that provide the aforementioned reports will also be required to send the reports in electronic format (e.g., MS Excel, X12 format, XML, and Comma Separated Values (CSV)) to the

Page 7 of 17

LIMS PMTC and O&M--Statement of Work

COTR. The COTR will then be responsible for forwarding this electronic format during the data call each month. The EVM report is due by the first business day of the month. This will run one month behind. For example, a report due on May 1 will contain data through March 31. Program management (including project management activities) costs will be broken out as a separate reporting element in the CPR formats.

2.1.5.3.
