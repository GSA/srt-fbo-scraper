Section C - Description/Specification/Work Statement (Jul 1999)
PERFORMANCE-BASED PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PBPWS) – Project Work Statement

TITLE: Point of Dispensing Online Design Tool for Public Information and Communication


BACKGROUND AND NEED

The Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS) and Division of State and Local Readiness (DSLR) routinely provides training and technical
assistance to state and local project areas using a facilitated, in-person workshops. These include the Public Information and Communication
(PIC) course as well as the Mass Antibiotic Dispensing (MAD) and Prep courses.

Part of this training includes having student-attendees design the point of dispensing (POD) layout for POD operations overall and PIC
operations in particular (i.e., signage, staff, equipment). This is accomplished using large laminated charts of a simulated POD and indicating
the location of tools around and throughout the POD on the diagram.

Such realistic simulations of POD duties are crucial to enable state and local staff better determine areas for improvement. Although this
training provides significant value to staff in project areas, it remains difficult to later repeat the exercise activity or share it within the
jurisdiction without the charts.

Therefore, the need exists to provide to communications professionals involved in Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) POD planning additional
tools to enhance and maintain their skills following the training, in a format they can utilize on their own, outside of a formal training
setting.

The DSLR PIC Team already has in place an interactive, online role-playing scenario that enables players to act within a decision-making
environment during a public health emergency. This existing tool is the Medical Countermeasure Response Trainer (MCRT).

Of need at this time is a new module within MCRT, an interactive, online, graphic-based platform that will enable PIC planners to virtually
build, review, and test various layouts for a POD and to use the results of the testing to enhance their plans.

PURPOSE (Project Objective)

The goal of this project is to provide an online, interactive graphic-based POD design tool for public information officers (PIOs), POD
managers, or others involved in the medical countermeasure dispensing components of SNS planning at the state, local, tribal, or territorial
level. This Web-based tool will be suitable for leave-behind and refresher training. This project will be referred to as the “MODULE” within
this statement of work.

SCOPE OF WORK

    • Vendor shall create a Web-based, interactive MODULE that enables the user to virtually design, build, and test the layout of objects used
      for medical countermeasure dispensing functions within a POD.

    • The MODULE shall have 2-D and 3-D on-screen “first-person” views for the user to move and place the objects (e.g., hanging signs on virtual
      walls within the POD). User must be able to move the view (“camera”) within the 3-D visualization. An avatar (visualization of the player
      or virtual characters) is not required.

    • The MODULE must be compatible for MS Internet Explorer and at least one other commonly used Internet browser program. MODULE must utilize
      Adobe Flash 3D or comparable technology, and must not require software to be installed on the user’s computer.

    • The MODULE must be integrated within the existing MCRT online role-playing scenario and databases.

    • The MODULE must not require simultaneous multiplayer action (i.e., MODULE can be used by one person interacting with the computer).

    • The MODULE must have at least three types of virtual POD environments available for user customization. These are (a) a small-to-medium-
      sized POD (e.g., a clinic or small-building setting); (b) a large-sized POD (a gymnasium or community center setting); and (c) a drive-
      through POD (parking lot setting).

    • The MODULE must display interior and exterior (e.g., parking lots) visuals of the virtual POD environments for user customization.

    • The MODULE must have an administrator-customizable inventory of virtual POD-suitable items (e.g., blank and pre-filled signs, video
      stations, tables) within the simulation. Each item must be displayed appropriately with an icon in the 2-D and 3-D views (i.e., in the 3-D
      view, item must appear as it would in the real world. In the 2-D view, item can appear as an icon specific to that item).

    • The MODULE must have a function to enable the player to add text to virtual signs within the POD environment.

    • The MODULE must have a function to enable the user to print out the results of the design in 2-D map/floor plan and 3-D views. The MODULE
      must enable the user to print out a checklist of items used from the inventory.

    • Vendor must ensure that the MODULE will contain adequate instructions on how users are to initiate and progress through the virtual POD
      design.

    • Vendor shall ensure an evaluation component of the role player’s actions is built within the MODULE. This component will enable the role
      player to view and save or print the results (i.e., an after-action report) of their session.

    • Vendor shall ensure the MODULE has a user-identification/login component in order for role players/users to create an account for the
      MODULE, save their location within the design, and logout and return to the same place in the design at a later time.

    • The MODULE created by Vendor for this project shall be wholly owned by CDC upon the MODULE’s completion.



Work Breakdown Structure


[pic]


SPECIFIC TASKS TO BE PERFORMED (Technical Requirements)

    • Vendor shall meet with PIC subject matter experts (SMEs) from DSLR in order to confer and agree on the scenario outline and role player
      actions.

    • Vendor will develop all data files for the MODULE.

    • Vendor will upload and host all data files for the MODULE during and after the time frame specified in the contractual agreement. The cost
      for hosting the data files will be delineated within the vendor bid. No files will be hosted on CDC servers.

    • MODULE must be Internet server-based, and not require installation of the program onto a user’s individual computer. Small “cookie”
      software for user profile will be permitted for individual computer installation.

    • Vendor shall create and provide contract manager with a functional CD-ROM demo of the interactive scenario that does not require Internet
      access.

    • MODULE must be developed with the ability for DSLR SME, in the capacity of MODULE administrator, to make or update content changes to the
      finished scenario (i.e., message screens, virtual inventory).

    • Vendor will update contract manager every two weeks by e-mail or phone, or more often as needed, on the progress of the MODULE’s
      development prior to launch.

    • Vendor must build or customize MODULE to contain CDC- and DSNS-specific language and branding within the scenario as agreed upon by DSLR
      PIC SMEs and vendor.
    • Vendor must include in MODULE a mechanism by which to access and produce usage reports, including number of unique users during various
      date ranges.

    • MODULE must generate a printable certificate of completion for each user who completes a full module in the scenario.

         ➢ MODULE must meet all provisions of Section 508 as outlined below.

         ➢ Vendor will remediate Medical Countermeasure Response Trainer to meet the Section 508 standards validated by completing the
           applicable checklists verified by the Project Officer.

    • Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 USC 794d)

    • Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information
      technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. All final deliverables must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility
      standards, and CDC reserves the right to reject deliverables that fail to meet the standards. Remediation of any materials that do not
      comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or
      consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. Regardless of format, all electronic documents -
      including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with
      disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. The following Section 508
      provisions apply to the content or communications material identified in this SOW or PWS:

    • 36 CFR 1194.21, .22, .24, .31,  and .41.

Documents must be in unlocked form.  Acceptance checklists for various file formats are available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508/index.html

OTHER REQUIREMENTS

Performance-based Outputs and Standards.  See Performance-based Matrix for specific outputs and standards.

Quality of Support

The Contractor shall ensure that all Contractor support personnel are adequately trained, possess the requisite experience, and are otherwise
fully qualified to provide the high level of support required by agency prior to being assigned to this task order.

Continuity of Support:

This is a non-personal service, Performance-Based task order; therefore, the Contractor shall have the responsibility for individual personnel
management, to include removal and replacement.  The Government may require the removal and replacement of personnel as a result of security
actions or other reasons, or the removal of personnel that cannot perform the task or display unacceptable conduct. The Contractor shall ensure
the contractually required support level is maintained at all times.  The contract is for specified skill types/levels and labor hours not for
specific individuals. The Contractor shall ensure that all contract support personnel are present for all hours of the workday. If for any
reason the specified staffing levels are not maintained, due to vacation, leave, appointments, etc., and replacement personnel will not be
provided, the Contractor shall obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to the employee absence, otherwise, the Contractor
shall provide a fully qualified replacement.

These are non-personal service tasks. The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this
contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee
relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest
of the Government to afford both parties a full and complete understanding of their respective obligations.

Contractors are not federal employees, and federal employees may not interact with contractor personnel as if there is an employer-employee
relationship.  This means that federal employees do not:

Supervise contractor employees:

    • Participate in interviewing contractor personnel;

    • Review, approve or select resumes for personnel provided by the contractor (unless authorized by the contracting officer);

    • Hire, fire or discipline contractor personnel;

    • Schedule individual contractor personnel hours;

    • Reassign contractor personnel;

    • Grant or deny contractor personnel leave requests (but you have the right and obligation to know who and when personnel will be on-site);

    • Assess performance or individual contractor personnel;

    • Provide performance feedback on individual contractor personnel;

    • Provide input for contractor employee annual (or periodic) performance appraisals;

    • Provide or discuss contractor employee performance and career development plans;

    • Provide training not stipulated in the contract to contractor personnel without coordination with the Contracting Officer and/or Office of
      General Counsel; and

    • Provide rewards or awards unless performance meeting specific criteria and are approved by the Contracting Officer and the OGC.

We contract for services, not for individuals.  The companies with whom we contract have processes to deal with personnel issues.  Federal
employees can forward concerns to the Contracting Officer and/ or Contracting Officer’s Representative who are charged with communicating issues
to the contractor.

Only authorized Contracting Officers and purchase card holders may solicit and negotiate services from contractors.  The consequences of other
individuals soliciting or negotiating services include additional documentation and delays as well as personal liability.

Contractor personnel cannot perform inherently governmental functions.  This means that federal employees cannot request or allow contractor
personnel to:

    • Represent the government;

    • Supervise or direct federal employees;

    • Determine what supplies/services are to be purchased by the government;

    • Negotiate or obligate the government to pay for goods or services;

    • Determine federal program priorities, draft strategic plans; and

    • Perform other functions involving the exercise of discretion in applying governmental authority or value judgments.

Federal employees must ensure that the work stipulated in the contract is performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.
 The contract defines the government’s obligations and the contractor’s responsibilities.  Contractors do not have “other duties as assigned.”
Federal employees:

    • Cannot require, agree, or encourage performance of service outside scope of the contract;

    • Cannot request contractor personnel to perform prior to obligation of funding by the contracting officer;

    • Cannot perform the contractor’s work/obligations or provide contractor personnel government resources (including other contractor
      services), training, government owned vehicles, or supplies except as stipulate in the contract;

    • Must ensure that hours/services required under the contract are provided;

    • Must ensure that the government is billed properly for direct labor; that includes:

    • Only for time spent working on direct contract requirements.

    • Generally may not authorize contractor employees to bill direct labor for teambuilding or other activities; and

    • Not putting contractor employees in position of taking unpaid leave in order to join you and be viewed as part of the team.


Federal employees have a duty to conserve and protect government resources, and must ensure that government furnished property, facilities, and
resources are used only for contract performance.  Federal employees may not give preferential treatment or endorse any product, service,
individual, or company.

Federal employees cannot provide information to contractor employees except as required for contract performance and as authorized to distribute
the information.
Contractors must submit FOIA requests for information not necessary for performance set forth in the contract.  Only Contracting Officers may
release source selection information.  Proprietary data being used by the Government may not be shared without the express or implied consent of
the owner of the data.
Federal employees cannot allow contractors to use the agency’s name, seal, or acronym in connection with commercial activity unless approval is
obtained.  Contractor employees may not use government business cards or business cards that state or imply that they are federal employees.

Federal employees can never solicit gifts from contractor employees, and may not accept gifts (anything of value including local transportation)
unless an exception to the gift rules applies.  Federal employees may not accept contributions to group gifts from contractor employees.
Contractor personnel use of government furnished property (government computers, telephones, etc.) is subject to the terms of the contract.
Contractors cannot use GFP for:

    • Outside business activities;
    • Personal activities; or
    • Solicit/fundraising


Contractor personnel are required to identify themselves as contractors when they attend meetings, answer telephones, respond or send emails
using a government/military address or work in situations where their actions may be construed as acts of Government officials.

 Contractors may not represent the government nor represent themselves as government employees.  Contractors may not use government
organizational occupational titles.
Federal employees may have professional relationships with contractor personnel, but if you have a close personal relationship (or other
financial interest), with t contractor employee, you may not give advice, make recommendations, or make decisions pertaining to the contractor
for whom the contractor person works.

Federal employees have a duty to report (promptly and accurately) adverse information about contractor performance.  Federal employees must
resolve all performance issues through the COR and Contracting Officer.  The COR and Contracting Officer have a duty to take appropriate
contractual action.  Federal employees have a duty to report improper and potentially criminal activity (ies) to the appropriate government
office (Office of the Inspector General or OGC) and not to the contractor.   Additional questions should be addressed to your OGC.

Given the nature of the task requirements and the working environment, it may be necessary for Government and Contractor personnel to work as a
team to accomplish work objectives, share knowledge, and work in a mutually supportive role.  This should be accomplished while preserving the
non-personal services nature of the task.  The operational need to work in concert should be accomplished in a manner consistent with preserving
the management responsibilities of the contractor.

Working in a team environment, absent a designated contractor supervisor, may require the Government to provide work direction to contractor
personnel.  Work direction means a communication to Contractor personnel that directs or approves approaches, documents, presentations, or
refinements to work; fills in details or otherwise completes the general description of work or documentation items; shifts emphasis among work
areas or tasks; or furnishes similar instructions to Contractor personnel. Work direction includes requiring analyses and development of
administrative related products within the scope of work for the task.

The Contractor is at all times responsible for the quality of contractor personnel work.  It is the direct responsibility of the Contractor to
perform all tasks normally associated with an employer-employee relationship, e.g., completing time cards, resolving quality of work issues,
ensuring high motivation and morale, and resolving Government-identified contractor performance concerns.  The physical absence of a Contractor
direct line supervisor does not relieve the Contractor of these responsibilities.

To ensure effective and efficient administration of duties, the Contractor personnel need to establish and maintain work procedures that
facilitate close and continuous coordination with agency Contracting Officers (CO), Project Officers (PO), and other Program Management (PM)
personnel.

In addition, EAPO frequently responds to politically sensitive, high level support requirements with extremely short suspense actions. To
function effectively and efficiently as a team member in this environment, the Contractor must ensure personnel provided possess a high degree
of subject matter knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform the tasks relating to the objective. The Contractor supervision of Contractor
personnel must also reflect the need to sustain a high-performing, highly motivated, and responsive team.

G.3 Project Officer

(a) As representatives of the program office, a Project Officer (PO) must ensure that program requirements are clearly defined and must advise
the Contracting Officer to help ensure that the contract is designed to meet those requirements. CDC guidance makes a distinction between
Project Officers and CORs (Contracting Officer’s Technical Representatives). Project Officers are a PO in the preaward option period and a COR
after award, when a separate COR is not designated. The Contracting Officer will provide under separate cover the duties and responsibilities of
the COR. This document will be provided to the PO, COR and the Contractor.  The PO/COR is not authorized to alter the requirements of this
contract without written approval of the Contracting Officer.  PO/COR is not authorized to obligate any funds.

(b)  Performance of the work hereunder shall be subject to the technical directions of the designated Contracting Officer’s Representative for
this contract.
(c)    As used herein, technical directions are directions to the Contractor which fill in details, suggest possible lines of inquiry, or
otherwise complete the general scope of work set forth herein.  These technical directions must be within the general scope of work, and may not
alter the scope of work or cause changes of such a nature as to justify an adjustment in the stated contract price/cost, or any stated
limitation thereof.  In the event that the Contractor feels that full implementation of any of these directions may exceed the scope of the
contract, he or she shall notify the originator of the technical direction and the Contracting Officer in a letter separate of any required
report(s) within two (2) weeks of the date of receipt of the technical direction and no action shall be taken pursuant to the direction.  If the
Contractor fails to provide the required notification within the said two (2) week period that any technical direction exceeds the scope of the
contract, then it shall be deemed for purposes of this contract that the technical direction was within the scope.  No technical direction, nor
its fulfillment, shall alter or abrogate the rights and obligations fixed in this contract.

(d)  The PO/COR is not authorized to change any of the terms and conditions of this contract.  Changes shall be made only by the Contracting
Officer by properly written modification(s) to the contract.

(e)  The Government will provide the Contractor with a copy of the delegation memorandum for the PO/COR.  Any changes in PO/COR delegation will
be made by the Contracting Officer in writing with a copy being furnished to the Contractor.

(End of Clause)

completes the general scope of work set forth herein.  These technical directions must be within the general scope of work, and may not alter
the scope of work or cause changes of such a nature as to justify an adjustment in the stated contract price/cost, or any stated limitation
thereof.  In the event that the Contractor feels that full implementation of any of these directions may exceed the scope of the contract, he or
she shall notify the originator of the technical direction and the Contracting Officer in a letter separate of any required report(s) within two
(2) weeks of the date of receipt of the technical direction and no action shall be taken pursuant to the direction.  If the Contractor fails to
provide the required notification within the said two (2) week period that any technical direction exceeds the scope of the contract, then it
shall be deemed for purposes of this contract that the technical direction was within the scope.  No technical direction, nor its fulfillment,
shall alter or abrogate the rights and obligations fixed in this contract.

The Government COR is not authorized to change any of the terms and conditions of this contract.  Changes shall be made only by the Contracting
Officer by properly written modification(s) to the contract.

G.5 Evaluation of Contractor Performance (Service) (Jan 2000)

(a) Purpose

In accordance with FAR 42.1502, the Contractor's performance will be periodically evaluated by the Government, in order to provide current

evaluation.

(f)  Resolving Disagreements between the Government and the Contractor

Disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation will be reviewed at a level above the Contracting Officer.  The ultimate conclusion
on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency.  Copies of the evaluation, contractor's response, and review comments, if
any, will be retained as part of the evaluation.

(g)  Release of Contractor Performance Evaluation Information

The completed evaluation will not be released to other than Government personnel and the contractor whose performance is being evaluated.
Disclosure of such information could cause harm both to the commercial interest of the Government and to the competitive position of the
contractor being evaluated as well as impede the efficiency of Government operations.

Departments and agencies may share past performance information with other Government departments and agencies when requested to support future
award decisions.  The information may be provided through interview and/or by sending the evaluation and comment document to the requesting
source selection official.

The agency will retain past performance information (if applicable) for a maximum period of three years after completion of contract performance
for the purpose of providing source selection information for future contract awards.

I.7  HHSAR 352.232-9 Withholding of Contract Payments (Apr 1984)

Notwithstanding any other payment provisions of this contract, failure of the Contractor to submit required reports when due or failure to
perform or deliver required work, supplies, or services, will result in the withholding of payments under this contract unless such failure
arises out of causes beyond the control, and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor as defined by the clause entitled "Excusable
Delays" or "Default", as applicable. The Government shall promptly notify the Contractor of its intention to withhold payment of any invoice or
voucher submitted.

(End of clause)

I.8 HHSAR 352.233-70 Litigation and Claims (Apr 1984)

The Contractor shall give the Contracting Officer immediate notice in writing of any action, including any proceeding before an administrative
agency, filed against the Contractor arising out of the performance of this contract, including, but not limited to the performance of any
subcontract hereunder; and any claim against the Contractor the cost and expense of which is allowable under the clause entitled "Allowable Cost
and Payment." Except as otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish immediately to the Contracting Officer
copies of all pertinent papers received by the Contractor with respect to such action or claim. To the extent not in conflict with any
applicable policy of insurance, the Contractor may, with the Contracting Officer's approval, settle any such action or claim. If required by the
Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall effect an assignment and subrogation in favor of the Government of all the Contractor's rights and
claims (except those against the Government) arising out of any such action or claim against the Contractor; and authorize representatives of
the Government to settle or defend any such action or claim and to represent the Contractor in, or to take charge of, any action. If the
settlement or defense of an action or claim is undertaken by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all reasonable assistance in effecting
a settlement or asserting a defense. Where an action against the Contractor is not covered by a policy of insurance, the Contractor shall, with
the approval of the Contracting Officer, proceed with the defense of the action in good faith. The Government shall not be liable for the
expense of defending any action or for any costs resulting from the loss thereof to the extent that the Contractor would have been compensated
by insurance which was required by law or regulation or by written direction of the Contracting Officer, but which the Contractor failed to
secure through its own fault or negligence. In any event, unless otherwise expressly provided in this contract, the Contractor shall not be
reimbursed or indemnified by the Government for any liability loss, cost or expense, which the Contractor may incur or be subject to by reason
of any loss, injury or damage, to the person or to real or personal property of any third parties as may accrue during, or arise from, the
performance of this contract.

(End of clause)

I.9  HHSAR 352.249-14 Excusable Delays (Apr 1984)

(a) Except with respect to failures of subcontractors, the Contractor shall not be considered to have failed in performance of this contract if
such failure arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.

(b) Such causes may include, but are not restricted to, acts of God or of the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or
contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and unusually severe weather, but in every
case the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. If the failure to perform is
caused by the failure of a subcontractor to perform, and if such failure arises out of causes beyond the control of both the Contractor and
subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either of them, the Contractor shall not be deemed to have failed in performance of the
contract, unless: the supplies or services to be furnished by the subcontractor were obtainable from other sources, the Contracting Officer
shall have ordered the Contractor in writing to procure such supplies or services from such other sources, and the Contractor shall have failed
to comply reasonably with such order. Upon request of the Contractor, the Contracting officer shall ascertain the facts and extent of such
failure and, if he/she shall determine that any failure to perform was occasioned by any one or more of the said causes, the delivery schedule
shall be revised accordingly, subject to the rights of the Government under the termination clause hereof. (As used in this clause, the terms
"subcontractor" and "subcontractors" mean subcontractor(s) at any tier.)

(End of clause)

I.10    HHSAR 352.270-7 Paperwork Reduction Act (Jan 2001)

(a) In the event that it subsequently becomes a contractual requirement to collect or record information calling either for answers to identical
questions from 10 or more persons other than Federal employees, or information from Federal employees which is outside the scope of their
employment, for use by the Federal government or disclosure to third parties, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-13) shall apply
to this contract. No plan, questionnaire, interview guide or other similar device for collecting information (whether repetitive or single-time)
may be used without first obtaining clearance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Contractors and Project Officers should be guided
by the provisions of 5 CFR Part 1320, Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public, and seek the advice of the HHS operating division or Office
of the Secretary Reports Clearance Officer to determine the procedures for acquiring OMB clearance.

(b) The Contractor shall obtain the required OMB clearance through the Project Officer before expending any funds or making public contracts for
the collection of data. The authority to expend funds and proceed with the collection of information shall be in writing by the Contracting
Officer. The Contractor must plan at least 120 days for OMB clearance. Excessive delays caused by the Government which arises out of causes
beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor will be considered in accordance with the Excusable Delays or Default
clause of this contract

                                                    Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

1.0  Introduction

1.1   The Government must effectively validate in a timely manner the performance of the Contractor in meeting the services required.  This QASP
      provides a systematic surveillance method for the services, and describes the methodology by which the Contractor’s performance will be
      monitored.

1.2   The principal focus of the surveillance system is the Contractor’s performance of the indicators identified in the Performance-Based
      Matrix at Paragraph 16.0 of the Performance Based Statement of Work (PBPWS).  Therefore, the QASP surveillance standards are identical to
      those in Section 16.0.  See Tab 1 for a copy of the Performance-Based Matrix.

1.3    The contractwill be surveilled with this Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).

1.4   The plan contains the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Contractor Performance Report, which should be utilized in documenting all
      Contractor and contractor performances. The NIH system allows you, the Contracting Officer’s Representative or Contracting Officer, to
      report Contractor and contractor performance on a national, easily accessible database. It requires you to review the database prior to
      approving the use of a Contractor to insure that the Contractor or contractor has done a good job in the past. As a result, it is
      anticipated that the NIH system should help motivate the Contractor, wishing future work in the Federal sector, on the current contract
      toward superior performance.  See Tab 2 for a copy of the NIH Report.

1.5   For the purpose of this plan, AGENCY considers the FAR 52.246-4  Inspection of Services- Fixed-Price.
      to meet the FAR Part 46.304 criteria for establishing a procedure for contracts for services, or supplies that involve the furnishing of
      services.

1.6   This QASP:

1.6.1  Identifies the services and products that will be measured.

1.6.2  Establishes the specific standards of performance for each required output.

1.6.3       Establishes the responsibilities for performing the measurement.

1.6.4       Defines the Government role in overseeing the performance.

1.6.5       Provides for feedback to the Contractor regarding quality, quantity, and timeliness of the service outputs.

1.6.6       Establishes timeframes for communicating performance improvements.

2.0   Methods of Surveillance:

2.1   The Performance-Based Matrix at lists the services to be monitored and the standards to be applied.

2.2   This QASP is based on the premise the government desires to maintain a quality standard for acquisition support services.
2.3   The Contractor, and not the government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  The
      role of the government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved.

2.4    In this contract the Contractor quality control program is the basis for service quality. The Contractor is required to only deliver
      acquisition support services that conform to the requirements of the contract.


3.0   Roles and Responsibilities:

3.1   The Contractor’s primary responsibility is to ensure all requirements are met at the required quality level.  The Government shall ensure
      this responsibility has been met before payment is made to the Contractor.  The primary Government team members are the Project Officer
      (PO) and the Contracting Officer (CO).

3.2.  The CO has the overall responsibility for overseeing the Contractor’s performance.  The CO is responsible for monitoring Contractor
      performance in the areas of contract compliance, contract management, and the resolution of all issues relative to the language of the
      contract.

3.3   The COR is responsible for directly monitoring, assessing, recording, and reporting on the technical performance of the Contractor.  The
      PO will have primary resnsibility for signing off on all invoices and documenting the inspection and evaluation of the Contractor’s
      performance.

3.4   The COR will work with staff and the Contractor to ensure good communication and resolve any problems not requiring the CO’s authority.

4.0   Surveillance: The COR will evaluate the performance objectives through periodic inspections during each service month.  See Tab 3 for a
      sample of a COR Monthly Evaluation Report).

4.1   The following information will be included:

4.1.1       Contract paragraph number referencing the requirement.

4.1.2       A Short description of the requirement being surveilled.

4.1.3       Date, time, and location of surveillance.

4.1.4       Results of surveillance.

4.1.5       Signature of individual accomplishing the surveillance.

4.2   All performance must be documented, whether acceptable or unacceptable. When unacceptable performance is documented, the COR shall take
      the following actions:

4.2.1       If government actions caused the unacceptable performance, take steps to prevent it in the future.

4.2.2       If the Contractor’s performance is unacceptable, inform the Contractor’s on site representative of the unacceptable performance and
      the reasons why it is unacceptable.

4.2.3       If the contractor wants to dispute the results of the surveillance, refer them to the CO for resolution.

4.3   Performance should not be determined unacceptable until all possible contributing factors have been considered.

4.4   For required tasks not shown on the Performance-Based Matrix, the government still retains the right to inspect any item included in the
      contract. These services will be inspected periodically and the results provided to the CO.

5.0   Standards: All standards in the Performance-Based Matrix must be met.  All deliverable dates and other contractual completion dates must
      also be met.  If any of the standards are not met, the Government shall receive consideration from the Contractor for breach of contract.

5.1   Late performance is un-excusable unless the Contractor can justify all of the following:

5.1.1       The delay was not the Contractor’s fault.

5.1.2       The delay was not foreseeable.

5.1.3       It was beyond the Contractor’s control to avoid the delay.

5.2   All work shall be performed in accordance with the PBPWS.  The COR shall not consider the services complete until all deficiencies have
      been corrected.

5.3   The COR shall determine whether the failure was a minor non-conformance or a substantive non-conformance.  (See Tab 4 for decision matrix
      on Nonconforming Deliverables.)

6.0   Procedures: The Government will inspect performance requirements to ensure contractor compliance and record results of inspection, noting
      the date and time of inspection.  Unacceptable performance and complaints shall be referred to the CO for investigation and validation.
      The CO will investigate and validate the unacceptable performance and/or customer input. The Contractor shall be given a reasonable amount
      of time after notification to correct the unacceptable performance and report to the CO that the deficiency has been corrected.  If
      deficiencies are not corrected, the COR will notify the CO and recommend a course of action.

7.0   Contract Performance Evaluation

7.1   FAR 42.15 - Contractor Performance Information establishes the Government responsibility for recording and maintaining contractor
      performance information.  This requirement does not apply to procedures used in determining incentive awards or other incentive systems,
      although the two systems should be mutually supporting.

7.2   FAR 42.1501 - Past performance information is relevant information for future source selection purposes, regarding a contractor's actions
      under previously awarded contracts. It includes, for example, the contractor's record of conforming to contract requirements and to
      standards of good workmanship; the contractor's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the contractor's adherence to contract
      schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and
      commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the customers.

7.3   The general procedures to be used are addressed in the following FAR section.

      42.1503 Procedures:
            (a) Agency procedures for the past performance evaluation system shall generally provide for input to the evaluations from the
      technical office, contracting office and, where appropriate, end users of the product or service.  (b) Agency evaluations of contractor
      performance prepared under this subpart shall be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluation.
      Contractors shall be given a minimum of 30 days to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information. Agencies shall provide
      for review at a level above the CO to consider disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation. The ultimate conclusion on the
      performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. Copies of the evaluation, contractor response, and review comments, if any,
      shall be retained as part of the evaluation. These evaluations may be used to support future award decisions, and should therefore be
      marked “Source Selection Information”.

4. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) form at Tab 2 will be completed at least annually and more frequently if necessary to motivate or
   reward the contractor.

Rating Guidelines



Quality of Product or Service



0 = Unsatisfactory    1 = Poor   2 = Fair   3 = Good   4 = Excellent   5 = Outstanding

|Unsatisfactory       |Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not    |
|                     |likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future   |

Section L - Instructions, Conditions, And Notices To Offerors
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with
additional information included in this notice as follows:

L.1  FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition (Jan 2004)

(a) Definitions. As used in this provision—
“Discussions” are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer’s discretion, result
in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal.

“In writing,” “writing,” or “written” means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes
electronically transmitted and stored information.

“Proposal modification” is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation’s closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or
made to correct a mistake at any time before award.

“Proposal revision” is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer
as the result of negotiations.

“Time,” if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and
legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day.

(b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall
acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s).

(c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.

(1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals
shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing
the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers
should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c) (1) (i) and (c) (1) (ii) of this
provision.

(2) The first page of the proposal must show—

(i) The solicitation number;

(ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available);

(iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to
furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item;

(iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the
offeror’s behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and

(v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal. Proposals signed by an agent shall be accompanied by evidence of that
agent’s authority, unless that evidence has been previously furnished to the issuing office.

(3) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.

(i) Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modifications or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in
the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m.,
local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due.

(ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified
for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that
accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—

(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to
the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or

(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under
the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

(3) It is the only proposal received.

(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at
any time it is received and may be accepted.

(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on
the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.

(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated
for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on
the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be
withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before
award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror
or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the
proposal before award.

(4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items.

(5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S.
dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

(6) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications
in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.

(7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer.

(8) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer.

(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover
sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror).

(e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for
any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall—

(1) Mark the title page with the following legend:

This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed—in whole or in
part—for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of—or in connection
with—the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the
resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from
another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of
sheets]; and

(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:

Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.

(f) Contract award.

(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s)
represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.

(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.

(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in
FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.
The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting
Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient
competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that
will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices
offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.

(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the
Government’s best interest to do so.

(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline
items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is
significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the
Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.

(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or
schedule risk.

(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal
shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:

(i) The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer.

(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on
the debriefed offeror.

(iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.

(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.

(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.

(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the
solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

(End of provision)


L.3   Length of Technical Proposal

The technical proposal should succinctly address the requirements alone and shall not exceed 15 pages in length (single spaced in a standard 12-

Section M - Evaluation Factors For Award

M.1   EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS

This section is intended to explain the rationale and precise criteria by which Proposals resulting from this solicitation will be evaluated.
Offerors are advised that they are not restricted as to what is presented in their Proposals, as long as sufficient material is provided to
allow evaluation of specific Proposal elements defined below, and page limitation restrictions are not violated.

indicate that the offeror understands the nature and extent of the work to be performed.  Offerors are hereby informed that both cost and the
result of the contractor’s technical Proposal shall be considered when selecting the successful offeror. Technical content and capability will
be weighted more heavily than cost or price. The Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to
achieve only slightly superior performance.  Award shall be made to that responsible offeror submitting the Proposal (Technical and Business)
determined to be the most advantageous and the best value to the Government as evaluated under the criteria described in this Section.
