(a) Base support includes Government-controlled working space, material, equipment, services (including automatic data processing), or other support (excluding use of the Defense Switched Network (DSN)) which the Government determines can be made available at, or through, any Air Force installation where this contract shall be performed. All Government property in the possession of the Contractor, provided through this base support SCR, shall be used and managed in accordance with the Government Property clauses.

(2) Section 2 Offerors are reminded that exceptions to terms and conditions will be considered as part of an integrated assessment of all offers received (as indicated in Section M of this solicitation). Thus, the most effective time to request clarification of, or express an exception to, the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation is during the proposal preparation stage, i.e. prior to the proposal due date, NOT in your proposal. If your offer includes exceptions to terms and conditions, they must be explained and justified in this Section in sufficient detail to allow the Government to determine the acceptability of your offer without necessitating discussions with your firm. Failure to provide detailed support for your position may, in conjunction with the other evaluation elements identified in Section M, lead to the determination that your proposal does not offer the best overall value to the Government. In the event that award is not made based on initial proposals and discussions are held, any revisions to the model contract (Sections A through J and Attachments) are to be agreed upon to the maximum extent possible during discussions by the Offeror and the Government before the Government requests a proposal revision. (3) Section 3 (i) If required by this solicitation in the Section L provision at AFFARS 5352.215-9000, FACILITY CLEARANCE, names and Social Security Numbers of personnel cleared or clearable that will be

assigned to the program upon award. This information will be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act, and will be used to verify security clearances. (ii) Information required in the Request for Proposal for which there is insufficient space in the requiring clauses or certifications. (iii) A statement indicating whether or not the Offeror is able to submit electronic invoices as set forth in the Section I clause DFARS 252.232-7003, ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUESTS AND RECEIVING REPORTS. (iv) Include the information required by the Section L provision DFARS 252.215-7003, EXCESSIVE PASS-THROUGH CHARGES - IDENTIFICATION OF SUBCONTRACT EFFORT, if required.

(4) Section 4 (i) Small Business Subcontracting Plan. Pursuant to paragraph (c) of FAR 52.219-9 -- Alternate II, and DFARS 252.219-7003 the Offeror shall submit as part of its initial proposal a subcontracting plan that complies with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 252.219-7003, except if (1) Offeror is a small business concern, (2) the proposal does not exceed $650,000, or (3) there are no subcontracting opportunities. In the event that the basis for not submitting a plan is there are no subcontracting opportunities, the Offeror shall provide a brief narrative addressing their technical approach as it relates to the absence of subcontracting opportunities. If the Offeror is a participant in the Department of Defense (DoD) Comprehensive Subcontracting Test program specified in DFARS 219.7, the Offeror shall provide a copy of the approved comprehensive plan. Failure to submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract. Offerors are reminded that the Small Business Subcontracting Plan (required from large businesses only) shall correlate with the proposal information on small business participation as well as all other sections of the proposal. (A) Offeror must provide sufficient information to support the Contracting Officer's review of the plan to determine if it is acceptable (otherwise Offeror will be ineligible to receive the contract award). The following are the Department of Defense (DoD) Subcontracting Goals for Fiscal Year 2012, which are provided to Offerors for informational purposes in order to highlight the importance of small business participation. The Offerors' proposed goals will be compared to these DoD-wide goals as one gauge of the extent to which Offerors have identified and committed to small business participation (see Section M); however, these DoD goals are not mandated since proposed goals may be higher or lower depending on the Offeror's technical approach to meeting Government requirements. Small Business: 36.7% of total subcontracting dollars (It is the Government's position that a 40% Small Business goal is attainable based on historical data for this program) HUBZone Small Business: 3.0% of total subcontracting dollars Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business: 3.0% of total subcontracting dollars Small Disadvantaged Business: 5.0% of total subcontracting dollars Women-Owned Small Business: 5.0% of total subcontracting dollars (B) The offeror should insure the plan reflects the entire acquisition value. Per AFFARS 5319.704(a)(1), goals must be expressed in terms of percent of contract value in addition to percent of subcontracted amount. (ii) Small Business Participation Plan. All offerors are required to submit a Small Business Participation Plan which will be used for the purposes of evaluating the extent to which offerors identify and commit to small business in contract performance on the effort. The Participation Plan is required from all offerors, including small businesses and companies with commercial subcontracting plans and comprehensive subcontracting plans. The Plan shall:
SECTION L FA8750-12-R-0120 PAGE L - 5 of 20

PART IV - REPRESENTATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS SECTION L - INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS

(A) Identify the extent to which Small Businesses (SBs),Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs), HUBZone Small Businesses, Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs), Historically Black Colleges/Universities or Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) would be utilized in the performance of this proposed contract. For small businesses, as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this solicitation, the Offeror's own participation as a SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZONE SB, WOSB, or HBCU/MI is to be identified, and will be considered in evaluating the Small Business Participation evaluation factor. (B) Provide the names of SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZONE SB, WOSB, or HBCU/MIs who would participate in the proposed contract, identifying specific components to be produced or services to be performed by them, and the estimated total dollars of such work. This amount is an estimated total amount for the entire contract. Include also the total contract amount to be performed by all businesses (large and small). These two figures will be used to arrive at the "total contract percentage" that will be performed by the various SB categories; SB total contract dollars, divided by total contract dollars, equals the percentage of contract to be performed by SBs. The Government will evaluate the extent of participation of all SBs in terms of the value of the total contract amount. Although participation may be higher or lower depending on the Offeror's technical approach to meeting Government requirements, for the purpose of this evaluation, the Government considers 8.5% small business participation to be a reasonable goal. The Offerors' proposed SB participation will be compared to this goal as one gauge of the extent to which Offerors have identified and committed to small business participation. Offerors submitting the best value in terms of small business participation will be rated higher. The participation goal will be assessed to determine whether the offeror provides the maximum practicable opportunity for SB concerns. (iii) Past promotion and monitoring of SBs. Include a description of the offeror's performance, over the past three calendar years (2011, 2010, 2009), in complying with the requirements of FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, including description and available documentation of the methods employed to promote small business utilization and the internal methods used to monitor such utilization. Large business offerors, as defined by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this solicitation, are to also address "available documentation" in complying with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, over the past three calendar years, including documentation of their accomplishment of the goals established under Subcontracting Plans of prior contracts. Large businesses that have never held a contract incorporating 52.219-9 shall so state. (A) Offerors will be assessed as to the "extent of substantive evidence" that the Offeror has maintained to comply with the FAR clause(s) for the past three calendar years. Such documentation may include commitments/agreements with SBs, reports, files, database, records, etc. tracking the usage of SBs as subcontractors. Provide a narrative informing how your company has historically promoted the usage of SBs as subcontractors (how your firm has made SB subcontracting opportunities available for SBs). Inform how your company has historically monitored SB usage (how your firm has reviewed SB subcontracting practices/opportunities). (Monitoring refers to keeping track of the amount of SB subcontracting; it does not refer to monitoring the performance of SB subcontracts.) Past SB efforts are an indicator whether your firm will utilize the SBs proposed to be involved in the instant procurement. (5) Section 5 (i) Per FAR 45.103(a)(2) and (4), the Government must eliminate to the maximum extent practical any competitive advantage a prospective contractor may have by using Government property. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation or attachments, the Government does not plan to furnish any Government property for use in the performance of the contract resulting from this solicitation. (ii) The Government may, however, authorize such use in accordance with FAR 45.3, Authorizing the Use and Rental of Government Property. To use existing Government property in the

Your proposal must include a listing of Government property you desire to use in the performance of the proposed contract, including the following information for each item: nomenclature, date of purchase, acquisition value, number of months of contemplated use (identify first, last, and all intervening months), rental fee, if applicable, and the copy of the Contracting Officer's written concurrence for such use. (iii) In the event that permission for such use of Government property is not authorized and the Contractor must furnish the property to perform the contract, identify the total cost impact, if any, to the proposed price. (iv) An evaluation factor as set forth in FAR 45.202, Evaluation Procedures, will be used to eliminate any competitive advantage from the use of such property unless the Contracting Officer determines that the use of an evaluation factor would not affect the choice of Contractor. RIK-L003 PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS - COST (VOLUME II) (APR 2012) (a) For proposal pricing purposes, Offeror should assume a contract start date of 1 NOV 2012. (b) The Government anticipates that the conditions for adequate price competition at FAR 15.4031(c)(1) will exist. However, submission of cost or pricing information in accordance with FAR 15.408, Table 15-2, is still required as part of the proposal in order for the Government to adequately evaluate the proposed costs. Offerors will not be required to submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data unless after receipt of proposals it is determined that adequate price competition does not exist. (c) Submit a cover sheet of the Offeror's choice containing the following information: (1) Solicitation, contract, and/or modification number; (2) Name and address of offeror; (3) Name and telephone number of point of contact; (4) Name of contract administration office (if available); (5) Type of contract action (that is, new contract, change order, price revision/redetermination, letter contract, unpriced order, or other); (6) Proposed cost, profit or fee, and total; (7) Whether you will require the use of Government property in the performance of the contract, and if so, what property; (8) Whether your organization is subject to cost accounting standards; whether your organization has submitted a CASB Disclosure Statement, and if it has been determined adequate; whether you have been notified that you are or may be in noncompliance with your Disclosure Statement or CAS (other than a noncompliance that the cognizant Federal agency official has determined to have an immaterial cost impact), and, if yes, an explanation; whether any aspect of this proposal is inconsistent with your disclosed practices or applicable CAS, and, if so, an explanation; and whether the proposal is consistent with your established estimating and accounting principles and procedures and FAR Part 31, Cost Principles, and, if not, and explanation; (9) The following statement: "This proposal reflects our estimates and/or actual costs as of this date and conforms with the instructions in FAR 15.403-5 (b)(1) and Table 15-2. By submitting this proposal, we grant the Contracting

Officer and authorized representative(s) the right to examine, at any time before award, those records, which include books, documents, accounting procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of type and form or whether such supporting information is specifically referenced or included in the proposal as the basis for pricing, that will permit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price." (10) Date of submission; and (11) Name, title, and signature of authorized representative. (d) For purposes of determining cost reasonableness and realism, the Contracting Officer requires that the information shown on the Table of Contents at the end of this provision be included in the cost proposal. The Offeror's format for submitting such information may be used. Do not omit any topics or elements. Additional topics may be added by the Offeror as necessary. All pages should be numbered. Fill in all blanks either with the applicable page numbers, or "N/A." (e) Subcontractors' proposals must be similarly structured. All subcontracted work must be properly identified as such. If a subcontractor elects to submit an abbreviated proposal to Offeror, it is Offeror's responsibility to see that the subcontractor simultaneously submits a complete detailed proposal per Table 15-2 directly to the Contracting Officer. Offeror must ensure that subcontractor adheres to the guidance set forth herein. FAR 15.404-3 requires that an Offeror provide an analysis of subcontractors' cost proposals. To that end, the Offeror's proposal must: (1) Identify principal items/services to be subcontracted. (2) Identify prospective subcontractors and the basis on which they were selected. If noncompetitive, provide selected source justification. (3) Identify the type of contractual arrangement contemplated for the subcontract and provide a rationale for same. (4) Identify the basis for the subcontract costs as included in Offeror's proposal (e.g., firm quote or engineering estimate, etc.). (5) Identify the cost documentation submitted by the subcontractor. (6) Provide a price analysis of the proposed subcontract in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b) and a cost realism analysis in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). Provide an analysis concerning the reasonableness, realism and adequacy of each subcontractor's proposal. If the analysis is based on a comparison with prior prices, identify the basis on which the prior prices were determined to be reasonable. (f) The cost proposal should be limited to the minimum number of pages necessary to satisfy the specific requirements set forth herein. Submission of volumes of computer-generated data to support the cost proposal is not necessary or desired. If computer-generated data is essential to support the cost proposal, it may be submitted as an addendum and must be clearly cross-referenced to the material it supports in the cost proposal. (g) Cost proposals should represent the Offeror's best response to the solicitation. Along with the information required in the Table of Contents, provide a brief narrative explaining the necessity and purpose of each proposed resource. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance and cost or price information must be fully explained in the proposal. Failure to explain any significant inconsistencies may demonstrate Offeror's lack of understanding of the nature and scope of the work required. Accordingly, cost proposals must be sufficient to establish the reasonableness, realism and adequacy of the proposed cost/price. Further, any modifications made to the initial proposal must likewise be thoroughly supported in writing regardless of whether such changes are made during negotiations or at the time of a proposal revision.

I. NOTICE: The following solicitation provisions pertinent to this section are hereby incorporated by reference:

FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SOLICITATION PROVISIONS 52.217-04 52.217-05 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS EXERCISED AT TIME OF CONTRACT AWARD (JUN 1988) EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JUL 1990)

II. NOTICE: The following solicitation provisions pertinent to this section are hereby incorporated in full text:
OTHER SOLICITATION PROVISIONS IN FULL TEXT

RIK-M001 EVALUATION CRITERIA (APR 2012) EVALUATION CRITERIA (a) Introduction. This Section outlines those factors which comprise the criteria the Government will consider in evaluating Offerors' capabilities and proposals. The criteria listed are intended to show the scope of the evaluation to be performed on proposals submitted in response to the Request for Proposal. Evaluation will be accomplished by comparing Offerors' capabilities and proposal elements against Government requirements. (b) Basis For Contract Award. This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with tradeoff source selection processes pursuant to FAR Part 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS). These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FARSite, http://farsite.hill.af.mil. The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of Technical/Technical Risk, performance confidence and Cost or Price. Contract may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conform to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government. The Government will compare differences in the value of technical features/capabilities and performance confidence with differences in cost or price to the Government. In making this comparison the Government values superior technical features/capabilities and performance confidence greater than lowest cost or price to the Government (see FAR 15.101-1). This may result in an award to a higher rated, higher priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors, and the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines that the technical, performance confidence and/or overall business approach of the higher price offeror(s) outweighs the price difference. The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation (described below). While the Government source selection evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost or price will still contribute substantially to the best value award decision. The Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost or price to the Government to achieve only slightly superior technical features and performance confidence.

(c) Procedures. All information furnished by Offerors will be evaluated, including (if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions) offeror's responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) and Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs). (1) Under the Technical factor, subfactors 1 - 4 will receive a color and an adjectival rating (subfactor assessment) in accordance with DoD Source Selection Procedures paragraph 3.1.2.2, Table 2. A separate technical risk rating will be assigned in accordance with DoD Source Selection Procedures paragraph 3.1.2.2.2 Table 3. Subfactor ratings shall not be rolled up into an overall color/adjectival rating for the Technical factor. The subfactor assessment depicts how well the Offeror's proposal meets the evaluation criteria and the solicitation requirements. Proposal risk represents the risks that are identified with an Offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the requirements of the solicitation. (2) Under the Past Performance factor, the Performance Confidence Assessment represents the evaluation of an offeror's present and past work record to assess the Government's confidence in the offeror's probability of successfully performing as proposed. The Government will evaluate the offeror's demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet user's needs, including cost and schedule. Each relevant contract shall have been performed during the past five years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. The Past Performance Evaluation will be accomplished by reviewing aspects of an offeror's recent and relevant present and past performance, focusing on and targeting performance which is relevant to Mission Capability subfactors and the Cost factor. A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners, will be made. In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Higher relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply: Degree of Relevancy Very Relevant Definition Past/Present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Past/Present performance effort invovled much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Past/Present performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Past/Present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

Relevant

Somewhat Relevant

Not Relevant

More recent and more relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment, than less recent, less relevant effort. The SSET, will conduct an in-depth review and evaluation of all performance data obtained to determine how closely the work performed under those efforts relates to the proposed effort. The SSET will, as deemed necessary, confirm past and present performance data identified by offerors in their proposals and obtain additional past and present performance data, if available from other sources. When relevant performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.

SECTION M FA8750-12-R-0120 PAGE M - 2 of 4

PART IV - REPRESENTATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

The SSET may consider the offeror's (including subcontractors, teaming arrangement and joint ventures), past performance in aggregate, in addition to an effort (contract) by effort basis. As a result of an analysis of those positive and negative aspects indicators identified, each offeror will receive an integrated Performance Confidence Assessment, which is the rating for the Past Performance factor. These ratings are defined in AFFARS MP5315.305, paragraph 5.5.3.2, Table 3. Although the past performance evaluation focuses on performance that is relevant to the Mission Capability subfactors and the Cost factor, the resulting Performance Confidence Assessment is made at the Past Performance factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a "Unknown Confidence" rating for the Past Performance factor. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. (3) After evaluation of all technical subfactors and the performance confidence assessment have been completed, cost or price to the Government will be compared against the evaluation results to determine the combination that provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. (d) Specific Criteria for Award. The factors identified below, listed in descending order of importance, will be considered during proposal evaluation. (1) Factor 1: TECHNICAL The Technical factor will be evaluated on the basis of the following Subfactors, with Subfactors 1-3 all being of equal importance and Subfactor 4 being of lesser value. (i) Subfactor 1: Subfactor 1: Stand-up Plan. Soundness of the proposed approach to contract startup to be fully operational within a maximum sixty (60) day period with minimal disruption to the program and customers, to include schedule and availability of qualified cleared personnel at the time of award; staffing/recruiting/hiring of personnel; dates and procedures for transferring functional responsibilities. (ii) Subfactor 2: Subfactor 2: Life Cycle Support. Soundness of the proposed management and life cycle maintenance approach to support NASIC architectures, systems, databases and applications identified in the PWS. (iii) Subfactor 3: Technology Application. Demonstrate an understanding of, and soundness of approach towards, the application of Oracle object-relational technology, information modeling technology, software as a service, web services, cloud technology, COTS integration (e.g. Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft System Center, Microsoft InfoPath) and multi-media processing (e.g. text, audio, video, imagery). (iv) Subfactor 4: Small Business (SB) and Historically Black College or University (HBCU) and Minority Institution (MI) Participation. The extent, in terms of the value of the total acquisition, to which the offeror identifies and commits to SBs, and HBCUs and MIs in performance of the contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. (2) Factor 2: PAST PERFORMANCE. The extent to which the Offeror's past performance met customer requirements, including the Offeror's history of forecasting and controlling costs, adhering to schedules (including the administrative aspects of performance), reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally the Offeror's business-like concern for the interests of the customer. In addition, past performance of the Offeror in complying with requirements of
SECTION M FA8750-12-R-0120 PAGE M - 3 of 4

PART IV - REPRESENTATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

the Section I clauses at FAR 52.219-8, 52.219-9, and DFARS 252.219-7003(g) including compliance with subcontracting plan goals will be considered. (3) Factor 3 - Cost OR PRICE. The Cost or Price factor will be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria: (i) Reasonableness - the degree to which proposed cost or price compares to the cost or price a reasonable and prudent person would expect to incur for the same or similar goods or services. (ii) Realism - the degree to which proposed cost or price demonstrates that the Offeror understands the objectives and requirements of the contemplated contract. Evaluation will consider evidence that the Offeror can successfully complete the requirements for the proposed cost or price. The evaluation will consider as well the degree to which the proposed cost elements conform to established forward pricing standards and procedures. (e) Rejection of Unrealistic Offers. The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated ot be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program. (f) Correction Potential of Proposals. The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency. The judgment os such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal does not meet the Government's requirements and is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range. (g) Pre-Award Survey. The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offeror's capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.
