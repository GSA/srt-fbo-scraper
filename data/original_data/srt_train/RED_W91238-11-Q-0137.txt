Background: The Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) in Davis, California is an office within the US Army Corps of Engineers. One of HEC's main missions is to develop engineering software. HEC has developed multiple software packages, which have all been designed and updated starting in the early 1990's. This specific contract relates to the River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software package. The creation of this software began in the early 1990's. The interface of HEC-RAS is written in Visual Basic, starting back with version 1.0, and is now using Visual Basic 6.0. However, it has become obvious that with changing technology and the fact that Microsoft no longer supports Visual Basic, it is time to change the interface. We have decided to move to VB.NET using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

The purpose of this contract is to provide HEC with onsite software architecture design services that will assist in laying out the new User Interface using Microsoft .NET and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The main products of this contract will be a design document and detailed design diagrams. Task 1: Provide On-site Design Services: Provide 5 days of design guidance to the HEC-RAS team which will result in a .NET based client application architecture that addresses the application requirements as well as the aspects of maintainability, extensibility, security and deployment. Ensure the architecture is compatible with modern technologies, especially .NET 4.0 and WPF. Work closely throughout the onsite meeting with the lead developer and the HEC-RAS team in order to make sure the engagement is as productive and efficient as possible. This meeting will be held at the Corps of

US Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center

Engineers office in Davis, CA. at a date to be determined that is mutually acceptable to both the contractor and government, but within 30 days from award of contract. Contractor is expected to attend this meeting in person. During this meeting, HEC will explain the current configuration of HEC-RAS; explain the inner working of the HEC-RAS model; provide details of the user base; and how HEC-RAS is used while explaining the desired outcome. Deliverables: After reviewing the HEC-RAS requirements with the HEC-RAS team, design a bestpractices model that can be used as a template which provides the migration path to .NET 4.0 and WPF. Produce and deliver a vertical slice implementation that demonstrates the use of the appropriate technologies, design patterns, and frameworks to satisfy the requirements. Provide 40-60 design diagrams in UML or equivalent format depicting the various design aspects of HEC-RAS. HEC should be able to simply implement these diagrams as the HEC-RAS blueprint. In addition, contractor will provide a summary report and documentation of the meeting. All deliverables shall be submitted to HEC within 15 days of conclusion of the meetings. HEC will evaluate the submittals within 15 days of receipt to determine acceptability. The contractor shall address any comments within 10 days of receipt. Items Provided By HEC: HEC will meet with the contractor, at the HEC offices, and explain the current configuration of HEC-RAS, explain the inner working of HEC-RAS, provide details of the user base and how HEC-RAS is used and explain the desired outcome of the consultation. Duration: Work to be accomplished within 70 days from date of award.

Payment and Invoices a. Invoices for payment shall be submitted upon completion of tasks as outlines in the pricing/payment schedule. Invoices shall include all necessary information, including any necessary supporting documentation and shall be submitted to: Original invoice WITHOUT additional information or supporting documentation: (Must be mailed:) USAED, Finance Center Attn: CEFC-FP 5722 Integrity Dr. Millington, TN 38054-5005 One copy each of Invoice WITH all required information including any necessary supporting documentation: (May be mailed or emailed to the following individuals): COR: Ms. Diane Cuming US Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center 609 Second Street Davis CA 95616 Ph: (530) 756-1104 Diane.A.Cuming@usace.army.mil

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency, (2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

Background: The Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) in Davis, California is an office within the US Army Corps of Engineers. One of HEC's main missions is to develop engineering software. HEC has developed multiple software packages, which have all been designed and updated starting in the early 1990's. This specific contract relates to the River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software package. The creation of this software began in the early 1990's. The interface of HEC-RAS is written in Visual Basic, starting back with version 1.0, and is now using Visual Basic 6.0. However, it has become obvious that with changing technology and the fact that Microsoft no longer supports Visual Basic, it is time to change the interface. We have decided to move to VB.NET using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The purpose of this contract is to provide HEC with onsite software architecture design services that will assist in laying out the new User Interface using Microsoft .NET and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The main products of this contract will be a design document and detailed design diagrams. Task 1: Provide On-site Design Services: Provide 5 days of design guidance to the HEC-RAS team which will result in a .NET based client application architecture that addresses the application requirements as well as the aspects of maintainability, extensibility, security and deployment. Ensure the architecture is compatible with modern technologies, especially .NET 4.0 and WPF. Work closely throughout the onsite meeting with the lead developer and the HEC-RAS team in order to make sure the engagement is as productive and efficient as possible. This meeting will be held at the Corps of Engineers office in Davis, CA. at a date to be determined that is mutually acceptable to both the contractor and government, but within 30 days from award of contract. Contractor is expected to attend

US Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center

this meeting in person. During this meeting, HEC will explain the current configuration of HEC-RAS; explain the inner working of the HEC-RAS model; provide details of the user base; and how HEC-RAS is used while explaining the desired outcome. Deliverables: After reviewing the HEC-RAS requirements with the HEC-RAS team, design a bestpractices model that can be used as a template which provides the migration path to .NET 4.0 and WPF. Produce and deliver a vertical slice implementation that demonstrates the use of the appropriate technologies, design patterns, and frameworks to satisfy the requirements. Provide 40-60 design diagrams in UML or equivalent format depicting the various design aspects of HEC-RAS. HEC should be able to simply implement these diagrams as the HEC-RAS blueprint. In addition, contractor will provide a summary report and documentation of the meeting. All deliverables shall be submitted to HEC within 15 days of conclusion of the meetings. HEC will evaluate the submittals within 15 days of receipt to determine acceptability. The contractor shall address any comments within 10 days of receipt. Items Provided By HEC: HEC will meet with the contractor, at the HEC offices, and explain the current configuration of HEC-RAS, explain the inner working of HEC-RAS, provide details of the user base and how HEC-RAS is used and explain the desired outcome of the consultation. Duration: Work to be accomplished within 70 days from date of award.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency, (2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
