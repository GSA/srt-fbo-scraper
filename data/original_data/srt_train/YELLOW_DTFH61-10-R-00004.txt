BACKGROUND


Technical Assistance for Office of Pavement Technology

The Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) Office of Pavement  Technology  (HIPT)  administers  an  extensive  pavement  technology  program  in
Washington, DC that provides leadership for the delivery of long-life pavements that meet our customer’s needs and are safe,  cost-effective  and
can be effectively maintained. A strategic outcome of this pavement technology program is improved condition and ride quality  of  pavements  for
user satisfaction.


FHWA Pavement Surface Characteristics Program


The FHWA Pavement Surface Characteristics Program has the vision to provide: Safe, Smooth and Quiet Pavements.  The  Program  has  the  following
objectives:

    • Pavements are designed, constructed and maintained to meet users’ expectations relative to ride quality.
    • Pavements are designed, constructed and maintained to reduce friction-related crashes.
    • Highway agencies use quiet pavement systems in noise-sensitive areas.
    • Pavements are designed, constructed and maintained to reduce the potential for splash and spray.

The FHWA has identified five priority gaps and related strategies associated  with  pavement  surface  characteristics  to  achieve  the  program
objectives:

      Priority Gap 1- Continued need for comprehensive surface characteristics specifications, quality standards and support implementation.
         • Develop and deploy accepted and validated test standards for tire-pavement noise measurement.
         • Develop and deploy accepted and validated test standards for smoothness measurements.
         • Develop and deploy accepted and validated test standards for texture and friction measurement.
         • Develop and deploy operations certification process for measuring surface characteristics.
         • Develop and deploy profile analysis tools.


      Priority Gap 2 - Lack of validated tools for assessing the surface characteristics of pavements.
         • Develop model to predict splash/spray performance as it relates to other surface characteristics.
         • Develop model to correlate surface characteristics with crash rates.
         • Develop integrated model to predict pavement responses with spatial surface characteristics.


      Priority Gap 3 - Lack of surface characteristics benefits documentation relative to pavement performance, user  satisfaction,  safety,  and
      environmental impacts in context of current practices.
         • Deployment of a report documenting pavement surface characteristics relationship to crashes.


      Priority Gap 4 - Lack of policy provisions to implement best practices related to surface characteristics.
         • Continue developing Technical Advisory on Friction Management.


      Priority Gap 5 - Lack of guidance to enable optimal design, construction and maintenance practices of pavement surfaces as  it  relates  to
      surface characteristics.
         • Development of threshold criteria for pavement friction and texture.

Examples of current activities supporting these strategies include:
    • development, refinement, and deployment support for pavement smoothness specifications development, refinement  and  deployment  of  ProVAL
      software;
    • development of pavement smoothness criteria for Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) and Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) Pavements;
    • development of functional performance indicators for pavements;
    • demonstration of  high-friction surfaces;
    • friction and texture measurement equipment loan program;
    • development and refinement of tire-pavement noise measurement specifications;
    • delivery of workshops on quieter pavement technology;
    • investigation of pavement effects in the Traffic Noise Model (TNM);
    • investigation of the texture-noise relationship;
    • development of quieter pavement technology for HMA and PCC pavements; and
    • development of a splash-spray prediction model for highway pavements.

REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTING SECTION 508 STANDARDS

In addition to the work requirements specified in this statement of work, vendors must ensure that all electronic  documents  that  they  prepare
will meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  The act requires that all electronic  products  prepared  for  the  Federal
Government be accessible to persons with disabilities, including those with vision, hearing, cognitive, and mobility  impairments.   Vendors  can
view Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act  (http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm)  and  the  Federal  IT  Accessibility  Initiative  (Home  Page)
(http://section508.gov/) for detailed information.

The FHWA has determined that the accessibility requirements contained in the  Electronic  and  Information  Technology  Accessibility  Standards,
Section 1194.22, “Web-based intranet and internet information and applications,” apply to this work.  The standards are available at  www.access-
board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm.  The following paragraphs summarize the requirements for preparing FHWA reports in  conformance  with  Section
508 for eventual posting by FHWA to an FHWA-sponsored website.  If you have further questions, please  contact  the  FHWA  contracting  officer’s
technical representative listed in this statement of work.

Electronic documents with images:
Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element in all publications prepared in electronic format.  Use descriptions  (such  as,  "alt"  and
"longdesc") for all non-text images or place them in element content.  For all documents prepared, vendors must prepare one standard HTML  format
(as described in this statement of work) AND one text format that includes descriptions for all non-text images.  “Text  equivalent”  means  text
sufficient to reasonably describe the image.  For example, an image that is merely decorative  requires  only  a  very  brief  “text  equivalent”
description.  However, if the image conveys information that is important to the content of  the  report,  then  text  sufficient  to  reasonably
describe that image and its purpose within the context of the report must be provided.



Electronic documents with complex charts or data tables:

When preparing tables that are heavily designed, provide adequate alternate information  so  that  assistive  technologies  can  read  them  out.
 Identify row and column headers for data tables. Provide the information in a non-linear form.  Markup shall be used  to  associate  data  cells
and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers.



Electronic documents with forms:

When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology  to  access  the  information,
field elements, and functionality required for completion and Submission of the form, including all directions and cues.

SYSTEM OF MEASUREMENTS

All technical reports shall provide units of measurement in the (SI) Metric System.  In tables and illustrations (such as graphs) that  may  need
to be expressed in English units, the conversion to SI required for each English unit used  must  appear  consistently  as  either  a  legend  or
footnote, or as part of the caption.  The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) publication “Standard Practice  for  Use  of  the  SI
International System of Units: The Modernized Metric System,” ASTM E380-89a or later, is the FHWA standard and shall be used  as  the  basis  for
conversion.

        under Section H as requirements are identified.  Each TOPR will indicate the objective  or  results  desired  by  the  Government.   This
        objective shall be within the scope, period, and maximum value of the contract.  The TOPR may be  issued  by  written  communications  or

     g) All task order proposals, both written and oral, shall be evaluated in accordance with

        required to notify the Contracting Officer by each individual task order in accordance with clauses 52.232-22, Limitation of Funds,  and
        52.232-21, Limitation of Costs, as applicable.  Any questions please contact the Contracting Officer.

NOTE: Task Orders issued under this contract may be either CPFF or FFP depending on the nature of the work requested and the CO’s determination.


TASK ORDER SELECTION CRITERIA



The FHWA anticipates that the following elements will be the standard criteria for awarding individual task orders: technical merit, adequacy  of
proposed staffing, past performance and cost/price in relation to task  order  requirements.  Each  task  order  will  indicate  any  changes  or
additions to standard criteria.  The order of importance for the factors will be identified in  each  individual  task  order  proposal  request.
Evaluation of past performance will be based on each awardee’s proposal’s past performance data as supplemented by the Government and  Contractor
during the life of the contract.  As work proceeds under this contract, it is  probable  that  the  past  performance  data  submitted  with  the
original contract proposal will be given less weight as current performance reports received on task orders performed under this contract.




FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE


It is the Government’s intent to give each awardee a “fair opportunity” to compete for each order in excess of $2,500.   However,  awardees  need
not be given the opportunity to be considered for a particular TO if the CO determines that:

(a)   The agency need for such supplies or services is of such urgency that providing such opportunity would result in unacceptable delays;

(b)   Only one such contractor is capable of providing such supplies or services required at the level of quality required because  the  supplies
      or services ordered are unique or highly specialized;


(c)   The order should be issued on a sole source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to a TO  already  issued
      under the contract or through exercise of option periods specified in  the  original  TO,  provided  that  all  awardees  were  given  fair
      opportunity to be considered for the original TO; or

(d)   It is necessary to place a TO to satisfy a minimum guarantee.


OMBUDSMAN


The Contracting Officer’s selection decision on each TO request shall be final and shall not be subject to protest, except  for  a  protest  that
the TO increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract.  Accordingly, in accordance with FAR 16.505 (b) (5), an ombudsman has  been
appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of contractor’s concerns resulting from task order award.  The existence of the ombudsman is  not
to diminish the authority of the contracting officer.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation  of  the  proposals  or  the
adjudication of formal contract disputes.  Therefore, before  consulting  with  the  ombudsman,  interested  parties  must  first  address  their
concerns, issues, disagreements and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, interested parties may contact the FHWA ombudsman, OMBUSDMAN POC TO  BE  INSERTED  AFTER
AWARD.


FUNDS AVAILABLE


   a) Currently, funds in the amount of $__________ are obligated to this contract.

   b) The balance of funding under this contract ($__________) will be obligated subject to availability of funds and  as  required  through  the
      issuance of task orders under the contract.

   c) The clause entitled "LIMITATION OF FUNDS" applies to this contract.  Any notification required on the part of the Contractor shall be  made
      in writing to the Contracting Officer.  In the event that the contract is not funded beyond the estimated cost set forth in  the  schedule,
      the Contractor shall deliver to the Contracting Officer the data collected  and  the  material  produced  or  in  process  or  acquired  in
      connection with the performance of the project provided herein together  with  a  summary  report  in  five  copies  on  its  progress  and
      accomplishments to date.


PAYMENT – COST REIMBURSEMENT


(a)   The Contractor may be reimbursed for direct and indirect costs incurred in the performance hereof as are allowable under the provisions  of
      Part 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in the not-to-exceed amount of $____________ (to be negotiated) subject to  the  Limitation
      of Funds Clause.

(b)   For cost-plus-fixed-fee task orders, the Contractor may request monthly interim payments for costs incurred during the performance of  each
      specific task order.  A statement of costs incurred by the Contractor in the performance of cost-plus-fixed-fee task  orders  issued  under
      this contract and claimed to constitute allowable costs shall support each monthly interim payment request. Each  monthly  interim  payment
      request shall be submitted in accordance with "The FHWA Billing Instructions for Cost Reimbursement Contracts" to be considered proper  for
      payment. Prior approval of the Contracting Officer is required if the Contractor wishes to use a different payment request format.

(c)   In accordance with clause 52.232-25, "Prompt Payment", monthly interim payments will be made by the 30th day following  receipt  of  proper
      request for payment by the designated billing office, unless audit or other review is considered necessary to ensure  compliance  with  the
      terms and conditions of the contract.  All interim payments hereunder will be made upon further determination by  the  Contracting  Officer
      that the Contractor is making adequate progress toward successful contract completion.

(d)   Final invoice payment shall be made upon the Contracting Officer's determination that all contract requirements have been  completed.   The
      payment due date for final invoice shall be established in accordance with the clause 52.232-25.


PAYMENT OF COST PLUS FIXED FEE TASK ORDERS


The actual amount of fixed fee payable under this IDIQ contract will be established through  the  issuance  of  cost-plus-fixed-fee  task  orders
under the contract.  The Contractor may request payment of fixed fee, by submission of a separate invoice,  upon  the  successful  completion  of
each cost-plus-fixed-fee task order unless otherwise specified in the task order.  The Government will pay the fixed fee  amount  for  each  Task
Order based on the Contracting Officer’s determination that all work under the Task Order has been satisfactorily completed.




PAYMENT OF FIRM FIXED PRICE TASK ORDERS


For firm-fixed-price task orders, unless otherwise specified in the individual task order, the Contractor may request payment for the firm-fixed-
price specified in the task order upon the Government’s acceptance of all work under that task order.  Satisfactory completion and acceptance of
the task order will be made by the Contracting Officer.


INDIRECT COSTS


Pending the establishment of final indirect cost rates which shall be negotiated based on audit of actual costs as provided in  Subpart  42.7  of
the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Contractor shall be reimbursed for allowable indirect costs hereunder at the billing rate  of   [__TO  BE
NEGOTIATED__].  This INDIRECT COST provision does not operate to waive the LIMITATION OF FUNDS Clause.  The Contractor's audited  final  indirect
costs are allowable only insofar as they do not cause the Contractor to exceed the total estimated costs for performance of the  contract  listed
on page 2 (SECTION B) and under the PAYMENT provision above.




LABOR ESCALATION


Labor rates for all personnel billed under this contract shall incorporate an aggregate salary escalation not to exceed [to  be  negotiated]  per
year, during the period of performance, including option periods.




INVOICING REQUIREMENTS

It is recommended that the Contractor utilize the GSA per diem web page (link provided below) to ascertain the  correct  hotel  and  M&I  expense
rates.  It is recommended that the Contractor include a printout of the web page, with the applicable per diem  line  highlighted  with  invoices
that include travel costs. Payments may be delayed when the Contracting Officer cannot determine from the invoice which rate  applies,  and  thus
cannot approve the invoice without going back to the contractor for more information.

NOTE: Each task order shall be invoiced as a separate contract with its own individual numbering and tracking of costs.

TRAVEL AND PER DIEM

Travel will be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and the current Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) which
are promulgated at 41 CFR, Chapters 300 to 304 and viewable at www.gsa.gov/federaltravelregulation.  The FTR implements statutory requirements
and Executive branch policies for travel by federal civilian employees and others authorized to travel at government expense.  The total travel
costs shall not exceed the amounts negotiated at the contract or task order level without express written approval of the Contracting Officer.
The following issues are summarized below to ensure a thorough and consistent understanding:

Travel requirements under this contract shall be met using the most economical form of transportation available.  If economy class
transportation is not available, the request for payment voucher must be submitted with justification for use of higher class travel indicating
dates, times, and flight numbers.  All travel shall be scheduled sufficiently in advance to take advantage of offered discount rates, unless
authorized by the Contracting Officer.  Fee is not authorized for travel and per diem expenses.

Approved per diem rates and POV mileage reimbursement rates are located at http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/home.do?tabId=0.

NOTE:  Most “economical form of transportation available” includes nonrefundable tickets for travel unless the task order specifically states
that the travel date(s) is tentative only.

NOTE:  [For proposal preparation purposes only: See Section L for guidance on preparing a cost estimate for travel.]

the Contracting Officer.  To protect sensitive information, the Contractor shall provide training to any Contractor employee authorized to
access sensitive information and, upon request of the Government, provide information as to an individual's suitability to have such

PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AND LIMITATION ON FUTURE CONTRACTING

(1)   It is anticipated that in performance of this contract, the Contractor may require access to, or receipt of, information and data relating
to FHWA’s plans, programs, technical requirements, and budgetary matters, and such other information, the disclosure of which may give
competitive advantage to recipients or would be adverse to the interests of the Government.

(2)   The Contractor shall not disclose such information acquired to anyone, other than those Contractor, subcontractor, or consultant personnel
performing work under this contract, without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer, until such time as the Government may have
authorized the release of such information and data to the public.

(3)   To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary, business confidential, or financial data of other

disclosure and agrees not to use it to compete against such companies.

(4)   It is anticipated that during performance of this contract, the Contractor may be issued task orders involving technical evaluations of

to perform as a prime Contractor, subcontractor or consultant, or in any capacity to any supplier under an ensuring Government contract.  Any
questions on this matter shall be immediately addressed to the Contracting Officer.

(7)   These restrictions do not limit the Contractor’s right to use and disclose any information and data obtained from another source without
restriction.

(8)   The Contractor agrees to train its employees who will have access to such sensitive information in all necessary security procedures and
require them to sign non-disclosure statements and certificates attesting to their understanding of the requirements for safeguarding such
information.

(9)   In the event that the Contractor fails to comply with this provision of the contract, the Government may terminate the contract for
default.

(10)         The Contractor shall include this provision, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts and consultant agreements for
performance of work under this contract unless excused in writing by the Contracting Officer.

supports the mission of DOT (e.g., hosting DOT e-Government sites or other IT operations).  If necessary, the Government shall have access to
contractor and any subcontractor facilities, systems/networks operated on behalf of DOT, documentation, databases and personnel to carry out a
program of IT inspection (to include vulnerability scanning), investigation and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to DOT data or IT
systems.

Within 30 days of contract award, the contractor shall develop and provide to the Government for approval, an IT Security Plan which describes
the processes and procedures the contractor will follow in performance of this contract to ensure the appropriate security of IT resources

The contractor shall screen their personnel requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to systems operated by the contractor for
DOT or interconnected to a DOT network in accordance with DOT Order 1630.2B, Personnel Security Management and ensure contractor employees are
trained annually in accordance with OMB Circular A-130, GISRA, and NIST requirements with a specific emphasis on rules of behavior.

The contractor shall include the above requirements in any subcontract awarded for IT services.

*IT means any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management,

(End of clause)
POST AWARD EVALUATION OF CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE

(a)   Contractor Performance Evaluations Interim and final evaluations of contractor performance will be prepared on this contract in accordance
with FAR 42.15 (or FAR 36.201 for construction, or FAR 36.604 for Architect-Engineering). The final performance evaluations will be prepared at
the time of completion of work.

Interim and final evaluations will be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluation. The Contractor can
elect to review the evaluation and submit additional information or a rebuttal statement. The contractor will be permitted thirty days to
respond. Contractor response is voluntary and is not mandatory. Any disagreement between the parties regarding an evaluation will be referred to
an individual at a level above the Contracting Officer, whose decision is final.  Copies of the evaluations, contractor responses, and review
comments, if any, will be retained as part of the contract file, and may be used to support future award decisions.

(b)   Electronic Access to Contractor Performance Evaluations
FAR 42.15 (or FAR 36.201 for construction, or FAR 36.604 for architect-engineering) require agencies to prepare interim and final evaluations of
contractor performance. The U.S. Department of Transportation utilizes the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Contractor Performance System
(CPS) to record and maintain past performance information. The CPS module for architect-engineer contracts is not yet available therefore the
following information regarding electronic access does not apply to architect-engineer contracts.

Contractors that have Internet capability may access evaluations through a secure Web site for review and comment by completing the registration
form that can be obtained at the following URL: https://cpscontractor.nih.gov /.   The registration process requires the contractor to identify
an individual that will serve as a primary contact and who will be authorized access to the evaluation for review and comment. In addition, the
contractor will be required to identify a secondary contact who will be responsible for notifying the cognizant contracting official in the
event the primary contact is unavailable to process the evaluation within the required 30-day time period. Once the contractor is registered and
a performance evaluation has been prepared and is ready for comment, the CPS will send an email to the contractor representative notifying that
individual that a performance evaluation is electronically available for review and comment.

procedures in order to assure that offers arrive on time. 

Bids/offers must be received in the Office of Acquisition Management by the time and due date specified herein to be considered timely and

NOTE:  Offeror’s DUNS number shall be included on page 1 of the RFP.

NOTE:  For pricing purposes, Offerors shall assume that all task orders under the contract will be issued on a cost-plus-fixed-fee basis.

A.    General.

Adequate competition is expected to exist; therefore, this action is exempt from the requirement for submission of cost or pricing data.
However, Offerors shall submit a budget summary for the entire 60 months contract period of performance and a separate summary for each year of
the project.  Budget summaries shall clearly identify the following information as applicable:

a.    Labor Rates - Direct labor-by-labor categories to include hour, rates and escalation. Anticipated promotions for any personnel shall be
included with the escalation calculation. The annual direct labor escalation rate and its basis shall be clearly stated with the proposal.
Discuss your proposed rate as compared to historical experience and include when and how escalation will be calculated/implemented.  State the
number of any additional direct labor (new hires) that will be required during the performance period of this acquisition.

NOTE:  Offerors must relate labor categories to the Government labor categories described above.

    b.      Productive Hours – Detail how you define “direct productive hours” and how vacation, sick and other types of leave are accrued,
accounted for, and charged.

    c.      Indirect Rates – Discuss your proposed rates for all years.  Identify all the various specific indirect rates including what they
are (pool and base), and what they are based on (e.g., labor overhead based on direct labor dollars) and how they are applied/calculated.

      Offerors must provide dollar values as well as percentages.  What will the impact be to your indirect rates if awarded this contract?

   d.       Subcontracting/Consultants:  If SubContractors and/or individual consultants will be used in carrying out the requirements of this
project, the following information concerning the SubContractor shall be furnished:

      (1)   Name and address of the SubContractor or consultant.

      (2)   Identify the individual’s name, positions and the portion of work to be conducted by the SubContractor or consultant.

      (3)   Cost/price proposal (with supporting information as necessary).

NOTE:  Prime Contractors/Offerors are responsible for performing a cost/price analysis on all their proposed SubContractors/consultants in
accordance with FAR 15.404-3.  A cost/price analysis report must accompany each named SubContractor/consultant as defined at FAR 15.404-3.

      (4)   A letter or other statement from each proposed consultant and/or Subcontractor indicating that they have been approached on the
matter of participation in this project and are willing and able to do so in the terms indicated.

e.    Other Direct Costs:  Offerors must provide a breakout of Other Direct Costs by category.

            NOTE:  For proposal preparation purposes, all Offerors shall propose a total ODC’s cost of $800,000 ($300,000 for the base period
and $200,000 for option year 1 and 2 and $100,000 for option year 3).

            NOTE:  For proposal preparation purposes, all Offerors shall propose a total Travel cost of $500,000 ($200,000 for the base period
and $100,000 for each option year).

Other Division:  If other divisions, subsidiaries, a parent or affiliated companies, will perform work or furnish materials under this proposed
contract, please provide the name and location of such affiliate and your inter company pricing policy.

Right of Examination:  By submitting your proposal, you, if selected for negotiation, grant the Contracting Officer or an authorized
representative the right to examine those books, records, documents, and other supporting data that will permit adequate evaluation of the
proposed price.  This right may be exercised at any time before award.  The Federal Highway Administration may use an independent Contractor for
cost and price analyses.

NOTE:  A budget summary shall be submitted for each year of the contract period and for the entire 60 months period in its entirety (see
Attachment 6).

f.    Profit/Fee:  Offerors shall include a proposed fee and its base.  For pricing purposes, Offerors shall propose fee based upon the
assumption of all cost-plus-fixed-fee task orders.  The proposed fee will be utilized for pricing purposes only.  While it should represent the
Offerors average anticipated fee, the actual profit/fee will be negotiated at the task order level, and may vary due to the complexity and risk
associated with each task order.

PART III – DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Offerors shall provide a brief statement in Volume II of the proposal that describes in a concise manner all past, present or planned
organizational, contractual or other interest(s), which may affect the Offerors' ability to perform the proposed contract in an impartial and
objective manner. The Contracting Officer will review the statement submitted and may require additional relevant information from the Offerors.
 In accordance with FAR Subpart 9.5, all such information, and any other relevant information known to DOT, will be used to determine whether an
award to the Offerors may create an actual or potential conflict of interest. If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the
Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the Offerors, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract
with the Offerors and include appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded.

reimbursement for work performed under the contract.  The submission of vouchers as suggested herein  will  keep  the  correspondence  and  other
causes for delay to a minimum and will thus assure prompt payment to the Contractor.

  2. Forms to be Used

In requesting reimbursement, Contractors are urged to use the regular Government voucher forms, Public Voucher for Purchases and  Services  Other
than Personal, SF-1034 and Continuation Sheet, SF-1035. Or the Contractor may use its own forms,  provided  the  Contractor’s  forms  follow  the
format of the SF-1034 and SF-1035.

3.    Preparation

Each billing shall be prepared in an original and two copies, arranged in two parts as follows and submitted at intervals  as  specified  by  the
terms of the contract.  Each billing must be sequentially numbered, beginning with 1 for each contract.  Billings  for  different  contracts  may
not be co-mingled on a single billing.

Part I - Summary of All Costs

This portion consists of a listing of cost elements, by general categories, i.e., direct labor, overhead,  etc.,  showing  the  amounts  incurred
during the period covered by the billing.  The reimbursement costs incurred, and the dates for the period for which billing is  made,  must  fall
within the period as set forth in the contract.

The Contractor shall include the following signed certification for support service contracts:









                                                                                                                                DTFH61-10-R-00004
                                                                                                                                 Attachment No. 1
                                                                                                                                      Page 2 of 5

      “I certify that the hours and/or materials identified are allocable  to  the  job  being  billed  and  that  the  costs  are  justified  as
      attributable solely to the performance of this Government contract.”


The Contractor shall include the following signed certification for all other cost reimbursement contracts other than support services:

      “I certify that all payments requested have been incurred, are allocable to this contract and have not been billed previously.”




The Contractor shall include the following signed certification for all other cost reimbursement contracts other than support services:

      “I certify that all payments requested have been incurred, are allocable to this contract and have not been billed previously.”

Part II - Details of Direct and Indirect Costs:

This part consists of a detailed statement of direct and indirect costs and supports each category of costs shown  in  Part  I.   The  Contractor
shall include a breakdown for the current billing period and cumulative  totals  since  contract  execution.   The  detailed  information  to  be
continued in Part II is to assist the Contracting Officer and program office personnel in verifying voucher vis-a-vis contract performance.   The
categories of costs should be itemized and described as follows:

        a. Direct Labor

      Direct labor costs consist of salaries and wages paid for scientific, technical and other work performed  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the
      contract and shall be billed as follows:

      List employees whose salaries or wages, or portions thereof, were charged to the contract; show the name,  title,  rate,  days  (or  hours)
      worked and amount for each individual.  Indicate if the labor rates include fringe benefits. If it is the Contractor’s established practice
      to treat fringe benefits as a direct cost at a percentage of total labor costs, show the rate and amount as a separate item.  If it is  the
      Contractor’s established practice to treat fringe benefits as an indirect cost, such costs shall be billed separately as an  indirect  cost
      item.

      The cost of direct labor charged directly to the contract shall be supported by time records maintained in the Contractor’s office.


                                                                                                                                DTFH61-10-R-00004
                                                                                                                                 Attachment No. 1
                                                                                                                                      Page 3 of 5

      (NOTE: Fringe benefits, bonuses, etc., are usually treated as indirect costs for inclusion in the  overhead  pool;  however,  they  may  be
      treated as direct labor costs or as “Other Direct Costs” if this treatment is in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards).

      Premium pay is the difference between the rates normally paid on a straight time basis, and amounts paid for overtime or shift work.   Such
      pay is not included in the direct labor and shall not be included in the billing for “direct labor” unless the Contractor has permission to
      utilize premium rates.

      Unless provided for in the contract, premium pay must be authorized by the Contracting  Officer  in  advance.   Billings  for  unauthorized
      premium pay cause delays in payment due to suspensions and exchange of correspondence.  Citations to authorizations for  premium  pay  will
      avoid delays in payment.

      Authorized premium pay may be shown in Part I as a single item; in Part II it must be separately itemized for each position or job category
      showing the amount and a citation of the Contracting Officer’s letter of authorization.

      If there is an annual escalation clause for direct labor in the contract, these rates shall not be exceeded in the billings.

      b.    Materials and Supplies

      Only those items which the Contractor normally treats as “direct costs” shall be claimed under this heading.  Items costing less  than  $25
      should be listed by category of materials or supplies (e.g., film, rentals, office supplies).  Materials and supplies which exceed  a  unit
      price of $25 should be billed separately.  Show the description and dollar amount of individual items.  All materials and supplies  charges
      must be supported by the Contractor’s records.


      c.    Other Direct Costs

      NOTE: Other direct costs represent expenses related directly to the contract, provided such expenses are  consistently  treated  as  direct
      costs rather than indirect costs.


      d.    Travel

      When authorized in the contract as a direct cost, travel costs directly related to specific contract performance may be billed as a  direct
      cost.  Travel costs detail in Part II shall include:


                                                                                                                                DTFH61-10-R-00004
                                                                                                                                 Attachment No. 1
                                                                                                                                      Page 4 of 5


           1.    Name of traveler and official title.

           2.    Purpose of trip.

        4. Transportation costs, identified as to rail, air, private automobile (including mileage and rate) and taxi.


        5. Unless otherwise authorized, travel costs will be reimbursed based on DOT Travel Regulations.  This regulation provides for CONUS Per
           Diem reimbursement prescribed by GSA.  Current regulation limits first and last days of travel to 3/4 Per Diem for each day.


      If travel is made at other than economy fares, a statement shall be included indicating the reason for the deviation.  Also, a copy of  the
      air or rail ticket shall be included.

      e.    Consultant Fees


      Part II of the voucher shall include the consultant’s name, rate, number of days or parts of days and the total amount of charges.

   f. Subcontract Payments

      The voucher shall include the name of the subcontractor and the total amount of charges, supported by a break-down by elements of cost.


   g. Equipment

      Nonexpendable equipment must be identified, showing name of article, make, model, number of units, unit cost, and total cost.

   h. Indirect Costs

      Pending the establishment of final negotiated indirect rates for  the  Contractor’s  fiscal  year  or  period  of  contract,  whichever  is
      applicable, indirect costs, i.e., overhead, fringe benefits and general and administrative expense must be billed at rates set forth in the
      contract.  Rates can be changed during performance of the contract only by  contract  modification.    When  the  rates  are  changed,  the
      Contractor shall show revised rates on succeeding vouchers.


                                                                                                                                DTFH61-10-R-00004
