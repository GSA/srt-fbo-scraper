The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance.  The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price.  If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services.  The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights (1) within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

(b)	Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727).  However, when a third party makes payment (e.g. use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.

The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.

(e)	Definitions.  The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

(f)	Excusable delays.  The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

(A)	The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.

(B) 	If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Other Than Central Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.

(C) 	EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.

(2) 	Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. 

(h)	Patent indemnity.  The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings.

For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.

Overpayments.  If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall—

Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the—

Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);

Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;

Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and

Contractor point of contact.

Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.

 (6)	Interest. 



All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in Section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, as provided in (i)(6)(v) of this clause, and then at the rate applicable for each six-month period as fixed by the Secretary until the amount is paid.

The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. 

Final decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if—

The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt within 30 days;

The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or

The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see 32.607-2).

 If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.

 Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:

The date fixed under this contract.

The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.

 The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on—

 The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;

 The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or

The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.

The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.  If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and request instructions for disposition of the overpayment.

(j)	Risk of loss.  Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss or damage to the supplies provided under this contract shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon:

	(1)	Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or

	(2)	Delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.

(k)	Taxes.  The contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and local taxes and duties.

(l)	Termination for the Government's convenience.  The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience.  In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work.  Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination.  The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.  This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.  The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.

(m)	Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance.  In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.  If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.

(n)	Title.  Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.

(o)	Warranty.  The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.

(p)	Limitation of liability.  Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items.

(q)	Other compliances.  The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this contract.

(r)	Compliance with laws unique to Government contracts.  The Contractor agrees to comply with 31 U.S.C. 1352 relating to limitations on the use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracts; 18 U.S.C. 431 relating to officials not to benefit; 40 U.S.C. 3701, et seq., Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act; 41 U.S.C. 51-58, Anti-Kickback Act of 1986; 41 U.S.C. 265 and 10 U.S.C. 2409 relating to whistleblower protections; and 49 U.S.C 40118, Fly American; 41 U.S.C. 423 relating to procurement integrity.

(s)	Order of precedence.  Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) the schedule of supplies/services; (2) the Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, and Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts paragraphs of this clause; (3) the clause at 52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5)  solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) other paragraphs of this clause; (7) the Standard Form 1449; (8) other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) the specification.

(t) 	Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

	(1) 	Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(2) 	(i) 	If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.  The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

 (ii) 	If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

	(3) 	The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

	(4) 	Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at   or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

C.22	 FSA 25-1 PROHIBITIONS ON CONTRACT PERFORMANCE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES (JUL 2012)



The Contractor has represented to the Department that it will perform all work required under this Contract within the United States.  If, at any time, the Contractor wishes to perform any Contract work outside the United States, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in advance and in writing, of its intention and request the Department’s approval.  The Contractor shall not perform any Contract work outside the United States unless and until it has received the Contracting Officer’s explicit, written approval to perform such work. In order to give proper consideration to the Contractor’s request, the Department may ask for, and the Contractor shall provide, information relevant to the proposed performance outside the United States, including but not limited to a detailed description of the physical, personnel and management resources to be used and any potential difficulties or constraints in performing in the foreign jurisdiction.  The Department may refuse to approve Contract performance outside the United States to the extent that, solely in the Department’s judgment, the Contractor has not shown that performance outside the United States would satisfy the Contract requirements and would not impair or degrade performance.  Further, the Department may refuse to approve any performance outside the United States for any other reason, or for no reason, except as otherwise required by the laws and treaties of the United States.  The Department may approve performance outside the United States subject to certain conditions, to which conditions the Contractor shall strictly adhere.  Neither performance within the United States, nor the Department’s refusal to allow performance outside the United States shall ever constitute a change to this Contract or give rise to any entitlement to additional compensation or excuse any failure of performance by the Contractor.  Nothing in this clause shall be interpreted to impose any obligation on the Department to allow or to refuse a request for performance of this Contract outside the United States.





C.23	FSA 27-1 LABELING OF DOCUMENTS (JUN 2007)



The Contractor shall not label any data produced in performance of this contract in a way that would restrict the Government's right to use or release the information.  If applicable, the Contractor shall include a legend that identifies sensitive data that should not be released for security reasons.  Under FAR clause 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General  (or 52.227-15, -16, -17) clause, this data may be used for any purpose the Government deems appropriate. Deliverables shall not contain vendor-specific logos, mottos, watermarks, or holograms. The Contractor shall not use, particularly for proposals, U.S. Government logos, such as the U.S. Department of Education or Federal Student Aid.  

C.24    FSA 31-1 CONTRACTOR TRAVEL EXPENSES (APRIL 2013)

Local travel is not an authorized direct expense under this contract.  Local travel is defined as travel within a 50-mile radius of the official duty station; and includes such things as regular commuting to and from the place of employment; parking, mileage, and fuel expenses; and any other items that are incidental to local travel. Other-than-local Contractor travel may be required in performance of this contract.  The Contractor shall secure authorization to travel in writing from the Contracting Officer prior to incurrence of any costs associated with other-than-local travel.  Costs incurred by contractor personnel on authorized travel will be considered allowable for payment as long as the costs are reasonable and consistent with FAR Subpart 31.205-46, as follows:

Costs for per diem, lodging, and incidental expenses are allowable up to the extent such costs are actual costs and do not exceed the maximum daily travel limitations effective for the city and fiscal year, as identified in the Federal Travel Regulations at .  The costs shall be downward adjusted when travel does not take an entire day.  

Costs for airfare are limited to the lowest price available to the Contractor during normal business hours unless such airfare would require travel during unreasonable hours, via circuitous routing, that is not reasonably adequate to meet the traveler’s medical or physical needs or that would result in unreasonable costs that would not be offset by travel savings.  In order for travel costs to be allowable in the above circumstances, the basis of the exception must be documented and justified.

All receipts for any travel cost incurrence, above $75, are submitted as supporting documentation, and travel expenses include the following:

Date and place of the travel (city, town, or other similar destination);

Purpose of the trip; and,

Name of the person who incurred the expenses, and the relationship of that person to the Contractor.

   A. INTRODUCTION:

   Federal Student Aid (FSA) requires a NEW capability that meets or exceeds the objectives and adheres to the constraints listed below sections
   B and C of this SOO.  This capability is envisioned to replace the existing Personal Identification Number (PIN) system capability currently
   made available to non-privileged FSA external users (aid applicants, students, parents and others) to enable these users to access FSA systems
   and data.  Also, to facilitate the  FSA Enterprise Identity Management System (EIMS) initiative focused on obtaining a comprehensive
   enterprise-wide access and identity management capability, the new capability MUST either be integrated into the FSA Access Identity
   Management System (AIMS) or be able to interoperate with AIMS.  Attachment D-2 provides added background information about FSA, AIMS and the
   PIN system.

   B. OBJECTIVES:


   1. Using an operationally and cost effective approach, provide authorized FSA non-privileged external users a better and more secure
      capability for accessing the FSA systems and data that:

     a. does NOT require use of personal identification information (PII) during the login process and also provides these users the full range
        of identity and access management services, e.g., account creation; user provisioning and access; user self-care and other common
        capabilities;


     b. is able to effectively (i.e., operational and cost impacts are minimal) exchange data with other external and internal FSA  systems for
        authentication and other purposes;


     c. is able to readily support future functionality enhancements such as eSignature appliances; use of soft tokens, biometrics and other
        factors;  related services; and


     d. is able to efficiently integrate into or efficiently interoperate with the existing FSA AIMS.

   2. The technical architecture of this new capability is relatively easy to setup and deploy; is able to responsively support a large number of
      users (i.e., is highly scalable); is reliable and both simple and cost effective to operate and maintain; and supports Federated Identity
      Management.


   3. Will be fully supported in terms of routine operations and maintenance (O&M), technical help desk activities and making enhancements, for
      up to 18 months following initial project completion and deployment.


   C. CONSTRAINTS:

   1. Be CONTINUOUSLY available and responsive, including during periods of sustained peak usage; include a disaster backup and recovery
      capability; be able to be optimized to run virtualized servers and be effectively hosted in various environments including the cloud.

   2. At a minimum, be able to responsively support existing and future usage capacities including approximately 78 million current user accounts
      growing upwards of 10% per year; 220 million user authentication requests per year; web concurrency of 100,000 sessions; and 30
      authentications per second.

   3. Include user website interface(s) that will operate with all commonly used browsers, have an engaging look and feel, and is easy to
      navigate; provide appropriate security warnings and privacy policy information; during login, use a virtual keyboard or other equivalent
      capability to guard against user keystroke capture; denies a user access after a set number of access attempts; and does NOT permit use of
      permanent cookies.  Also, provides users a self-service functionality for registration; creating and updating credentials; customizing user
      preferences; accessing user information inclusive of retrieving historical use data; obtaining help guidance; and resolving access or other
      usage problems.  Additionally, will time out after first providing the user an advance warning, in 20 minute intervals or another duration
      that can be set by designated FSA system administrator(s).

   4. Includes a data repository designed for efficient storage and lookup of user data captured during registration that can subsequently be
      used to responsively authenticate users; facilitate user information exchanges with other external and FSA internal applications; and for
      other purposes; using web service calls or other equally or more effective methods. Also, that can be efficiently queried to obtain various
      reports and that includes a systematic and efficient process to capture legacy in support of data migration activities.

   5. Captures sufficiently detailed audit history about all user and administrator activities, e.g., user registrations and account changes,
      unauthorized access attempts, resource usage, source IPs, session logs, use of eSignatures, and other activities users or designated
      administrator(s) may engage in, and also includes data quality management toolsets.

   6. Provides authorized FSA administrators comprehensive administrative, management and reporting capabilities that can be accessed, via an
      intranet or the internet, and used to manage user accounts; obtain audit and tracking information; perform searches using various data
      parameters; edit, merge, split, add and delete accounts; and engage in other types of routine system administration tasks.

   7. Incorporates the use of strong and proven access controls, encryption, secure transmissions,  and other technology advances, so ALL users
      are provided end-to-end protection of data, from entry source; while traversing the internet or intranets; and within data storage
      repositories.

   8. Incorporates and aligns with industry best practices; displays a mindset of continuous improvement wherein involved resources think and act
      innovatively; and is delivered and supported using a managerial approach consistent with what Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 1
      advocates, that all involved acquisition team members, which include involved contractors, work collaboratively and cooperative and with
      trust, to do what makes sense and wisely use available resources.

   9. Complies with technology requirements contained in Section C clauses. Of note, in some cases, use of existing standard commercial
      procedures and practices to satisfy these government requirements,  at the discretion of the government, may be deemed acceptable.

  10. Includes sufficiently complete and detailed technical documentation to enable future FSA procurements for follow-on operations and
      maintenance (O&M) support, other types of enhancements and other possible expansion of capabilities.
Federal Student Aid (FSA) is a 1,250+ person performance based organization (PBO), within the Department of Education (DoED).  The mission of FSA is to facilitate the availability of financial assistance to millions of eligible applicants pursing education beyond high school.  Annually, this involves disbursing over $150 billion of loans, grants and other forms of assistance, while also managing a loan portfolio valued at almost $1 trillion.  FSA operates on core values of integrity, customer service, excellence, respect, stewardship and teamwork and seeks to be the most trusted and reliable source of student financial aid, information and services in the nation.  Key FSA strategic objectives include providing borrowers’ superior services and information; using leading and proven industry practices that are efficient, effective and innovative when serving student and other stakeholder interests; maintaining public trust; and doing what makes sense in a way that wisely uses public resources.   



The technology infrastructure used by FSA to deliver its mission consists of several systems and associated capabilities.  FSA external users fall into two categories - privileged and non-privileged. The former currently includes about 40,000 individuals who act as agents of certain entities, such as schools, and are authorized to access more than just single user information, e.g., information contained in various FSA systems related to all students attending the school which they are an agent for. Non-privileged users, such as new aid applicants, students, parents and others, number approximately 70 million individuals and these individuals can only access their own information. 



The FSA middleware environment provides a suite of common integration, communication and data management capabilities shared by FSA applications to exchange information and operate with data center hosting platforms.  This environment also includes the AIMS, which was developed using customized IBM TIM/TAM software.  For added information about the FSA middleware and AIMS environment, refer to  .   As shown, currently the FSA Participant Management (PM) and other applications are integrated into AIMS which enables  PRIVILEGED users to use AIMS for establishing login credentials; being authenticated when accessing other FSA systems; being provided or services such as Two Factor Authentication (TFA); and being able to easily be provided other security services that may be activated under AIMS.  Comparatively, instead of using AIMS, NON-PRIVILEGED users currently obtain access to FSA systems and data, by use of the FSA Personal Identification Number (PIN) system, see enclosure (1) to this Attachment D-2 for added PIN details. 



As FSA progressively moves to execute its Enterprise Identity Management System (EIMS) initiative, to ensure all of its security capabilities eventually interoperate and function as a unified enterprise asset, it intends to continue systematically integrating its legacy applications into the evolving enterprise security framework. Collectively, these actions should progressively provide all external users, along with FSA systems and data, better protection against compromise.Section 1 PIN Overview

The FSA  PIN web site is a source for NON-PRIVILEGED users to annually electronically apply for federal student aid and online  access to their personal data in FSA  records and as the electronic signature. On the PIN web site, in additiona to other functionality, users have the ability to select their own PINs or have the system generate PINs for them.  

PIN Usage

Within FSA the PIN is used to provide two main functions:

Authenticate user access to FSA customer-facing systems: PIN Clients leverage the PIN services to create and authenticate users. The authentication calls are used to grant access to PII data within the client systems. 

eSignature for FSA systems that have a requirement to sign documents: PIN Clients also leverage the PIN services to sign documents. The same authentication services are used by the system to implement eSignature rules. FAFSA simply authenticates the PIN at the end of the application. If authentication is successful the signed flag on CPS is set to “Yes”. SLMPN compares the document signer’s name with the name returned from the PIN authentication call. 

PIN Identifier Data

The PIN Identifier is stable data. PIN stable data is defined as:

Social Security Number 

First two characters of last name (padded with blanks if last name is less than two characters)

Date of Birth (CCYYMMDD)

PIN identifiers are used by client systems to look up the user data that access will be granted to. As an example, in FAFSA once successful authentication has been completed the user is then allowed to view data only for that SSN, Last Name and DOB combination. 

PIN Web Architecture

The PIN system leverages the following architecture components:

CPS – Sends request for SSA match through CPS. No direct relationship with SSA is in place for PIN. No address or zip code verification is performed.

ITA J2EE Application Stack – PIN is a web application that is runs under IHS/WAS.

ITA RCS – PIN leverages ITA’s common logger framework.

ESB – PIN leverages the ESB for messaging with CPS.

PIN Limitations

The analysis of the current PIN system has identified the following limitations:

Use of Personally Identifiable Information

The current PIN system uses several pieces of PII to authenticate users. 

Commingling of Credentials

The same PIN credentials are used for login and e-signature processes. 

Distributed Policy Enforcement

The current PIN authentication implementation requires each integrated system to take responsibility for access enforcement. 

Non-COTS-Based Solution

The current PIN system is completely custom built, and requires increasing maintenance effort due to the lack of off-the-shelf reusable components.    

PIN Requirements

PIN User Groups (Actors)

Two groups use the PIN system:

General Public – They use the PIN system to review general information on FSA processes and the PIN system specifically.

Authenticated Pin Website Users – They use the PIN system for authentication and to gain access to other federal student aid systems. 

Use Cases



Figure 21 – Use Cases

The current PIN web system implements the following 10 use cases:

Navigate PIN Web site - User navigates the PIN Web site.

Apply For A PIN - User establishes or updates a PIN application within the Federal Student Aid system.

Check PIN Status - Authenticated user checks the status of their PIN application.

Request A Duplicate PIN - Authenticated user requests a duplicate copy of their PIN.

Access My PIN E-mail - Authenticated user retrieves PINs via E-mail.

Change My PIN - User changes their PIN after logging into the PIN Web site.

Update My Personal Information - Authenticated user updates his or her personal information.

Disable My PIN - User logs into the PIN Web site and disable their PIN, to restrict all online access (including their own) to their Federal Student Aid information.

Reestablish My PIN - User who has disabled their PIN reestablishes their PIN after logging into the PIN Web site.

Activate My PIN - User activates their PIN, required before they are able to use their PIN.



PIN Interfaces

The PIN system has a series of interfaces that allow trading partner systems to authenticate users. There is also an interface which allows trading partner systems to apply for a PIN on behalf of a user. The PIN Authentication process flow is described in the following diagram.  

An inactive PIN is one for which the user hasn’t yet completed the process by coming back to the site and activating it after SSA match.  A deactivated PIN is a record that was formerly active which the user comes back and deactivates.

The current PIN system supports three flavors of interfaces. Each of these interface styles are described in the subsequent subsections.  Please refer to Table 31: FSA System Interface Mapping on page 9 for a matrix of systems using these interfaces.

Direct Database Access

Web Service

HTTP Redirect API

Direct Database Access

The Student Authentication Network (STAN) allows student loan borrowers to electronically sign their promissory notes using personal identification numbers (PINs). STAN enables private lenders who issue Title IV loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program to take advantage of PIN-based e-signatures. FAFSA and STAN have direct connections to the PIN database. They leverage the PIN Oracle Stored Procedures directly for authentication and user creation. This was done to mitigate performance concerns with the initial implementation of the web services and has not yet been migrated to the web service interfaces. 

Web Service

The web service interface supports three different web service operations:

PIN Authenticate

PIN Authenticate with Name

PIN Application

PIN Authenticate

PIN clients use the PIN Authenticate web service to authenticate users. The web service accepts stable data and PIN as input in a single field. 

PIN Authenticate with Name

The PIN Authenticate with Name web service is the same as PIN Authentication with the addition of returning last name, first name and middle initial. 

PIN Application

The PIN Application web service is leveraged by PIN client systems to create new PIN records to be sent to SSA for match. 

HTTP Redirect API

The HTTP Redirect method is used when PIN clients do not want to build their own user interface and instead use the PIN look and feel. The only service available using this method is authentication. The client uses a HTTP redirect to the PIN site. The PIN site authenticates the user and redirects the user back to the client with authentication results. 

This is a legacy API and has been deprecated.  All new clients are using the web services implementations. 

FSA Systems Using PIN

Table 31 shows which FSA Systems are currently using each of the different interface styles.   Blank cells show the system does not use the corresponding interface.

Table 31: FSA System Interface Mapping

Notes:

PIN leverages its own internal services to allow users to maintain their PIN information.

   E.4  EVALUATION OF PHASE 1 PROPOSAL INPUTS:


   1. The government will evaluate Phase 1 proposal inputs by considering four (4) factors , 1 -  whether or not the competitor is verified as
      being a small business (SB) under NAICS 541519;
      2 – whether or not the recent (within past 3 years) experience information  provided about work performed for other clients clearly
      demonstrates this work was relevant, i.e., it was similar to or more extensive than what the Attachment D-1 SOO requires and it was
      performed successfully; 3 – the overall rating of the technical approach and (4) the reasonableness of the estimated total costs.
      Specifically:

   a. Factors 1 and 2 will be rated as either ‘go’ or ‘no go’.  Specifically, to receive a ‘go’ rating, the competitor must be verified as being
      a SB under NAICS 541519 and the competitor must clearly demonstrate it or its proposed subcontractors or both, have recently successfully
      performed relevant work for other clients.  If either of these factors is rated as a ‘no go’ the competitor Phase 1 proposal will be
      discontinued from any further consideration and the competitor will not be eligible to be continued into Phase 2.

   b. Factor 3, proposed technical approach, will be rated as less than satisfactory, satisfactory or better than satisfactory, based on an
      overall assessment of its strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies and risks.  A strength represents a proposal attribute that exceeds what is
      required; a weakness represents a proposal attribute that only marginally meets what is required; a deficiency represents a proposal
      attribute that does not meet what is required; and a risk represents a proposal attribute that increases the probability that performance,
      in terms of quality, schedule, cost or a combination of these attributes, will not meet government expectations,.

   c. Factor 4, proposed estimated total cost, will be evaluated for reasonableness (not too excessive).

   2. During Phase 1, the government seeks to identify and qualify for continuation into Phase 2, the competitors whose Phase 1 proposals and
      related information provide the government a high degree of confidence that the competitor will be able to effectively satisfy the
      requirements stated in the SOO contained in Attachment D-1.  Further, EDAR 3415.302–70, see above section E.1, requires the contracting
      officer (CO) to limit the number of the selected competitors continued into Phase 2 to the number of sources the CO determines are
      appropriate and in the best interests of the Federal government. Accordingly, it is possible that competitors receiving a ‘go’ rating on
      factors 1 and 2, due to its technical approach rating; the government assessment of proposed estimated total cost reasonableness; or
      responsibility, conflict of interest (COI) and other considerations, e.g., RFP exceptions, may not be continued into Phase 2.

 E.5  OTHER INFORMATION:

   A. The successful offeror will be required to perform some of the work activities onsite, at the FSA Washington DC headquarters location.  For
      example, detailed requirements gathering for final design, unit acceptance testing, training, implementation and other key customer facing
      activities.  Other activities involved with executing the technical approach and creation of the related technical documentation represent
      work that can be performed offsite at successful offeror locations. Accordingly, competitors should considered any travel costs that may be
      involved with performing the onsite work and, as appropriate, reflect this in the completed Attachment D-4 spreadsheet, providing
      sufficiently detailed explanations about an travel cost entry, e.g., how the amount was derived.


   B. The Government reserves the right to conduct further exchanges with individual competitors solely to obtain clarifications related to
      proposal inputs. Also, if at any time if in its interest to do so, the Government may cancel or amend this RFP or entirely discontinue this
      procurement action, even after receipt of Phase 1 proposal inputs.

   C. Consistent with FAR Part 12, this RFP is divided into Parts A through E.  Part C provides the contract clauses FSA currently intends to
      include in the resulting contract awarded.  As appropriate, for various reasons, these clauses may be subsequently updated prior to actual
      contract award. RFP Parts A through D, which as appropriate may also be subsequently updated,  will continue to be included in the Phase 2
      RFP, along with a new Part E, however, the Phase 2  Part E will not be included in the contract the government intends to award as a result
      of this competition.

   D. In the Phase 2 RFP, FSA currently intends to require more detailed information about the technical approach, as may be subsequently refined
      or revised; require a fully resourced project schedule, to work breakdown structure (WBS) level 5 or 6 and showing activity relationships,
      be submitted for the technical approach articulated in Phase 2; require detailed pricing information, including operations and maintenance
      related costs be provided for this technical approach; require the submission of certain information about staff, especially the key
      personnel who will primarily work the project if the competitor is selected; and this and other information be discussed during an
      interactive oral presentation delivered by competitor executive leaders and key personnel.

   E. All  questions and clarifications related to this Phase 1 RFP, shall be sent to  to Tracy Pope, via email, at Tracy.Pope@ed.gov with
      Richard.Segich@ed.gov and Carolyn.Dickens@ed.gov included as a ‘cc’ on the these emails.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
principals—
    (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;
    (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property;
    (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,
this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]
    (1) Listed end products.

in the corresponding country as listed for that product.
      [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in
the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or
indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those
efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
  (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to
this solicitation is predominantly—
    (1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds
the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
    (2) o Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with

      (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or
subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly
average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract
period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used
for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

  7.  52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. (Apr 2010)


  (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that—
      (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals—
        (A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;
        (B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);
        (C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any
of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
        (D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
         (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
           (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
           (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when
full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
         (2) Examples.
           (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court
review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court
review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
           (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a
notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further
appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.
           (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is
in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
           (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed
under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
      (ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.
    (2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

  This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or
  Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.

  (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
  (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award
under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility.
Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the
Offeror nonresponsible.
  (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith,
the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which
is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
  (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

  10. Conflict of Interest Certification (Representations and Certifications)


(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, by signing the form in Attachment A, certifies that, to the best of their knowledge
and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR
Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the
contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to
a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor,
employee or consultant).  Conflicts may arise in situations such as the following:
1. Unequal access to information – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through
its performance on a government contract.

2. Biased ground rules – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on
the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract,

3. Impaired objectivity – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or
child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of
government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to
recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility.
"Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the
relevant facts to question a person's objectivity:
•     financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be
purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the
Department;
•     significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or
services; or
•     significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum,
specific products, property or services,
Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest)
regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity.
In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions
to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when
appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the
work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict.  In this clause, the term “potential conflict” means reasonably foreseeable conflict of
interest.
(B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if “impaired objectivity, or an actual or potential conflict of interest
(or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.
This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the
Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest).
 (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid
the appearance of a conflict of interest.  If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an
actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government
may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.  These remedies include
imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, § 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, §
3802.  Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.  The Contractor may also be required to
reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest.  An example of such costs
would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest.
(D) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate
the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.
(E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially
to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E).

                                                 Attachment – Conflict of Interest Certification

The Offeror, _______________________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no present or
currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or
task order resulting from Request for Proposal Number ED-FSA-13-R-0015 that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or
apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on
its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive
advantage.  In this clause, the term “potential conflict” means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest.  The Offeror further certifies that
it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government’s satisfaction, such Conflicts
of Interest (or apparent conflicts of interest).
