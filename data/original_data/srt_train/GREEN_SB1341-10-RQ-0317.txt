of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
  (c) "Period for acceptance of offers." The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified
for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.

designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is
4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
    (2)
      (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after
the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting
Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of
entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
        (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and
was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be
considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
    (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on
the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.
    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office
designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the
same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
    (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response
to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received
at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile
offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers,
the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
  (g) "Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids)." The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without
discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.
However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government
may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.
  (h)" Multiple awards." The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government
reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror
specifies otherwise in the offer.

          (End of Provision)

17.  52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

  The Government intends to make a single award but reserves the right to make no award as a result of this request for quotations.

The Government reserves the right to award this contract based on initial quotations without holding discussions.  Therefore, the initial
quotation shall contain the offeror's best terms and conditions.

Award will be made, if at all, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the requirements of the solicitation is deemed the most
highly rated and represents the best value to the Government considering the Government's evaluation of the following factors:  (1) technical
approach and capability, (2) qualifications/experience, (3) past performance, and (4) evaluated price.

Relative weight of the evaluation factors – Non-price factors 1, 2 and 3 are listed in descending order of importance.  Non-price factors, when
combined together, are significantly more important than price.  The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of
equality among quotations of the non-price factors.  In addressing the evaluation factors below, the offeror shall demonstrate:

Factor 1 Technical Approach and Capability

The Government will evaluate the offeror's technical approach and capability based on the information contained in the technical quotation to
determine the extent of its understanding of the requirements, including the soundness of the offeror's proposed methodology to effectively meet
and comply with the tasks outlined in the Performance Work Statement, to ensure successful performance of this procurement and any risks
associated with the offeror's technical approach and capability.

Factor 2 Qualifications / Experience

The Government will evaluate the offeror's experience and the resume(s) of its proposed key personnel to determine the nature and extent of the
offeror's successful completion of similar services related to manufacturing modeling and simulation.

Factor 3 Past Performance

The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirements and the extent to
which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years.  In assessing the offeror's past
performance, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work.  The Government will assign
a neutral rating to offerors with no relevant past performance.

(4) Price

The proposed price will be evaluated but not scored.  The price evaluation will  determine whether the proposed price is fair and reasonable in
relation to the solicitation requirements.  The proposed price shall be entirely compatible with the technical quotation.

Although price is the least important evaluation factor, it will not be ignored.  The degree of importance of the proposed price will increase
with the degree of equality of the quotations in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be based.

Federal agency;
    (2) /_/ Have, /_/ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of

exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judi cial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,
this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
    (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for "Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126)." __________
    (1) "Listed end products."
