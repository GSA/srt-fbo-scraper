The purpose of the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, or VPAT™, is to assist Federal contracting officials and other buyers in making
preliminary assessments regarding the availability of commercial “Electronic and Information Technology” products and services with features
that support accessibility.  It is assumed and recommended that offerers will provide additional contact information to facilitate more detailed
inquiries.
The first table of the Template provides a summary view of the Section 508 Standards.  The subsequent tables provide more detailed views of each
subsection.  There are three columns in each table.  Column one of the Summary Table describes the subsections of subparts B and C of the
Standards.  The second column describes the supporting features of the product or refers you to the corresponding detailed table, e.g.,
“equivalent facilitation."  The third column contains any additional remarks and explanations regarding the product.  In the subsequent tables,
the first column contains the lettered paragraphs of the subsections.  The second column describes the supporting features of the product with
regard to that paragraph.  The third column contains any additional remarks and explanations regarding the product.
