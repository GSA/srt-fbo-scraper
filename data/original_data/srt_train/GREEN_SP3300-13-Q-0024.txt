The total number of provisions within each Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses. ˇ Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type. Some of these may not be features of the vendor's deliverable. Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor's deliverable. If the deliverable includes additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered. ˇ Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard. Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the deliverable. ˇ Column four is a summary of the vendor's response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the Standard. ˇ Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected applicable provisions and actual product features.

(b) Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order Number 12979." (c) Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order Number 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this process is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer.

(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the Contractor (see Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.233-1), or, for the Agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal.
