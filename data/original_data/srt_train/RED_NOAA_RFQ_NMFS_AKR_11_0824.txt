GROSS DIAGNOSIS: 1.) Aspiration of sand (stranding related death); 2.) Early pregnancy 3.) Peritoneal effusion, marked, serosanguinous 4.) Possible trauma, axillary region. HISTOPATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSES: 1.) Aspiration pneumonia, subacute, severe with hemorrhage and some neutrophilic reaction. 2.) Pulmonary nematodiasis with associated bronchopneumonia, eosinophilic and intralesional parasite sections. 3.) Polioencephalomalacia, through cortex and cerebral Purkinje cells, marked. 4.) Cerebral edema, deep white matter, brainstem. 5.) Subdural hemorrhages and ring hemorrhages, most severe cerebral cortex. 6.) Organ congestion, marked 7.) Reactive tonsils with lymphoblasts 8.) Hepatitis, multifocal random, mixed; 9.) Focal hyperplastic dermatitis, lymphocytic, superficial (Probable old puncture-type wound). 10.) Possible degenerative myopathy 11.) Heavy PM overgrowth, generalized CASE SUMMARY: Cause of death in this case was most likely related to the effects of a live stranding on a pregnant animal (cardiovascular compromise, pulmonary edema, aspiration of substrate materials) probably complicated

by the moderate to severe parasitic and possibly bacterial pneumonia. The initial cause of the stranding could not be determined.
BRIEF HISTORY:

This was an old (?) adult, Female Beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas), which was stranded at Knik Arm, just outside Elderberry Park (61°13'4.69"N; 149°54'32.85"W) on Oct 09, 2009. It was reported by: someone at LGL on October 8, 2009 and I was contacted by Barbara Mahoney around 11:00am on the 9th. It was necropsied on 10/9/2009 starting around 2:00pm and had not been previously frozen. The carcass was fresh. The necropsy was performed on site for the adult and at AVPS for the fetus and the head by Kathy BUREK as main prosector, Ian Dickson as recorder and several of the marine observers and Amy from NOAA. The weather was slight drizzle and had been in the 40-50s.

Physical Exam (general condition, lesions, deformities, appearance, and color): This animal was positioned on her right side, with the tail extending down partially into a slough. She was on soft mud and had been tied in two places to sticks in the mud. There was no scavenging and no draining from the mouth.

The genital area and nipples were protruding and prominent. There were a few old rake marks. These were flat and white (old and healed). There was a single, approximately 2 cm diameter white lesion just caudal to the left eye, with a central, black pinpoint area. On cut section, the white epidermis extended down into the underlying dermis at this black spot (tattoo lesion?). Samples were taken for virology (viral media, RNAlater) as well as frozen and in formalin.

3

Her teeth were dark and were very worn, almost to the gum line, with some broken teeth. SQ: (fat stores, carcass condition, etc): The blubber layers were very white, firm and thick (fresh and good body condition).

4

There were occasional areas of gelatinous material in the muscle and blubber around the axilla). Body cavities (fluid?): On opening the abdomen, a moderate amount of SEROSANGUINOUS fluid was released (approx 3 gallons). Musculoskeletal (color of muscle, appearance of joint fluid: The muscles were WNL, dark red to black. There were some small gelatinous areas around the pectoral girdle on the left (hemorrhages or hypostatic settling).

5

Respiratory (foam, fluid, texture and color of lungs, parasites? ­ don't forget the sinuses and blowhole). The lungs were mottled dark pink to red. The bronchi were packed with sand and mud all the way out to the pleura. There were several 1 mm to 1cm hard, yellowish nodules in or subjacent to the pleura (old lung worm granulomas).

The trachea contained a small amount of sand and the mucosa was reddened. Sand extended deep into the lungs. The epiglottis was in place and was clear. No parasites were found in the sinuses. Cardiovascular: The heart was WNL. The blood was liquid, not clotted. Some was collected from the 6

heart and archived. Lymphoid: The spleen was oval with one division and was about 8 x 6 x 3 cm. It was dark red, firm and consistently dark red-brown. The TBLNs were firm, mottled grey, tan and yellowish and did not have a distinct CM organization, but was more of a lobular pattern. The caudal mediastinal LN had a very similar appearance. The tonsils are tubular, approximately 3 x 2 x 1 cm and extend on a stalk into the lumen of the pharynx. I could not find other lymph nodes. Endocrine: The adrenal gland was flat, multilobulated. I only found the left adrenal gland. I did not note the thyroid gland. The pituitary was well embedded into a sella turcica and surrounded by extensive retes. Urinary: The kidneys were firm and covered in extensive fat. There were approximately 20-25 soft to firm nodules varying from 1 cm to 3 cm diameter in the cortex. These contained part of a nematode and had thick fibrous or partially mineralized walls. The nematodes extended from then into the calyxes and had very coiled bodies. Several were collected in formalin and some in Ethanol. The urinary bladder was empty. Liver: (bile, parasites, color, And texture) : The liver was somewhat soft, very congested and gassy. I could not find bile ducts large enough to collected bile. Digestive: (serosal surface, content, mucosal surface, parasites) . The stomach was collected intact except for one hole that occurred during dissection into the squamous part. The stomach appeared to be mostly empty and I did not see parasites in the sections I looked into. There were a few sturdy nematodes in the esophagus. The intestines and colon were mostly empty, except for a very small amount of pasty tan material. Reproductive: The uterus was very enlarged and filled with fluid. The fluid was clear and had some small flecks of tan material. The right horn was much more distended with fluid and contained a small fetus. Membranes surrounded the fetus and also extended into the left uterine horn.

The fetal and maternal parts of the placenta had dissociated. The contents were odiferous and the fetus soft, with sloughing of the skin. The fetal membranes were consistent in color and consistency. The chorion was thin with a smooth side and then a "fuzzy" or roughened surface. The uterine mucosal surface was rugous, soft and folded. The umbilical cord had many epithelial plaques. The left ovary was smooth, consistent and oval. The right ovary was much large due to the presence of a large, firm 7

approximately 6 cm diameter CL. There was also a periphery, 1 cm diameter, firm, white nodule on this ovary (granuloma? CA?) The entire ovaries as well as representative sections of uterus and cervix were saved. The fetus was taken whole for later necropsy and that is CIB-100909F-AVPS. Red serosanguinous fluid could be expressed from the mammary glands (early mammary secretions). Nervous system: The brain was very congested, more so on the right vs. the left side (hypostatic congestion). The rete around the pituitary was quite congested. Special senses: The eyes were intact and were collected one frozen and one for histopathology. No parasites were found in any of the sinuses. The tympanic bullae were both fractured, with no evidence of hemorrhage ( most likely prosector artifact).

HISTOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS: The following tissues were examined: 1 LV ­ large amounts of sand and PM bacteria in the tissues. Poor PM condition for histo. 2 IVS ­ Aortic root and pulmonary artery ­ WNL 3 IVS ­ Many eosinophils and eosinophils precursors in blood vessels. Petechial hemorrhages in myocardium, perhaps some edema (heavy PM overgrowth and histologic changes). 4 RV ­ autolyzed 5 Diaphragm- There are scattered swollen muscle fibers. Otherwise, moderate autolysis. Tonsil ­ The tonsil is reactive and very congested. There are large lymphoblast type cells within the germinal centers. Large numbers of large rod shaped bacteria in the tissue and blood vessels. 6 LV ­ blood vessels are packed with Clostridia type organisms. Tissues are congested. This is primarily LAV valve. 7 Central R lung ­ large amounts of sand in section as well as colonies of Clostridial organisms. Some cross sections of nematode parasites close to the bronchus. This parasite has a narrow diameter, has coelomyarian polymyarian musculature and is surrounded by inflammatory cells. Some bronchi are surrounded by small numbers of eosinophils. The lung appears to be very wet and heavy. 8 Middle peripheral lung ­ this lung is similar to above but no parasite is Identified. 9 Spleen ­autolyzed Lung ­ Alveoli are full of fluid and debris, sloughed cells, red blood cells, inflammatory cells. There are some areas of interstitial inflammation. 10 Bronchus, middle lung ­ patches of inflammation, mostly eosinophils, macrophages, perhaps lymphocytes around bronchioli and in the interstitium. There is one bronchus in which the epithelium is markedly thickened by inflammatory cells. Liver ­ Patches of inflammation. Autolyzed with loss of most detail. 11 Lung ­ Patches of lung with alveoli and bronchi packed with inflammatory cells (eosinophils, foamy macrophages?), fluid, debris, occasional bright yellow material. (Hematoidin? Meconium? (Could this actually be from the fetus?). There are also some colonies of very fine bacteria (vs. the very common large rods) REQUEST GRAM STAIN. 12 Cr R lung peripheral ­ This section is very congested with pulmonary edema. There is a focus of inflammation subjacent to the pleura. Skin lesion ­There is an in-growth of epithelium into the dermis. This has relatively normal progression of the layers, with a compacted keratin layer and thinner than normal stratum spinosum. IN the skin in general, the stratum germinativum is piled up with frequent mitotic figure and there is a layer of compact parakeratotic cells on the very surface. IN the area of the lesion, there is intense lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. There is a surprising amount of melanin in this piece of skin for a white animal. Superficial dermal blood vessels are very congested. 13 Cd bronchus/lung ­ similar to others except there is a mineralized structure surrounded by inflammatory cells. 14 Cr R lung, middle section ­ inflamed and edematous, congested with some hemorrhage. Skeletal muscle ­ heavy PM overgrowth.

Cd lung, middle section ­ see above. Sh Muscle ­ WNL Lung ­ patch of intense inflammation. 17 Duodenum - autolyzed. There is parasitic granuloma within the lamina propria. 18 Uterus - autolyzed. Liver - is in advanced autolysis and is markedly congested. There is very heavy postmortem overgrowth. There is a focus of inflammation. Probable neutrophils and macrophages containing foreign material. 19 Uterus - autolyzed. There was no evidence of inflammation. Very congested. Skeletal muscle - within normal limits. 20 Jejunum - autolyzed. Left ovary ­ There are primary follicles, and atretic follicles. There is no inflammation. 21 Urinary bladder - the epithelium is completely sloughed. Tongue - The tissues are very congested. There are multifocal areas of mixed inflammation in the superficial dermis subjacent to the epithelium. In these areas, there are often apoptotic cells. There are also scattered acanthotic cells in the overlying epithelium. These tissues are relatively good condition. 22 Right ovary - large CL Kidney - autolyzed. 23 Eye ­ WNL 24 Vaginal plug ­ Papillary fronds of a mucus epithelium and large amounts of mucus. NO inflammation (WNL) 25 Brain - . There the brain is in good postmortem condition. 26 Forebrain ­ There are Many ring hemorrhages in the section. The tissue itself looks highly cellular with the perhaps increase lymphocytes. There are a possible necrotic neurons in a somewhat laminar pattern. 27 Frontal lobe - there are subdural hemorrhages. The blood vessels are packed with large Rod shaped bacteria (postmortem overgrowth). Around some of the blood vessels, there are inflammatory type cells and occasional brightly eosinophilic flat round globules, some of which contain nuclear debris. There are linear arrays of necrotic neurons within the deep layers of the gray matter. These neurons are brightly eosinophilic and have thin dense dark nuclei. There also fragments of eosinophilic material in these areas (spheroids). There are few areas where there appears be some satellitosis. 28 Anterior hippocampus - there is subdural hemorrhage. As well as ring hemorrhages. 29 Posterior hippocampus - again there is marked subdural and ring hemorrhages. This was labeled as posterior hippocampus, however there is no dentate gyrus. Many of the neurons look like dead Reds (could be artifact). Many the blood vessels contain fibrin thrombi with large versus postmortem bacteria. One blood vessel is packed full of inflammatory cells, fibrin and postmortem bacteria. From the blood vessels are surrounded by edema fluid macrophages and possibly inflammatory cells. There is a definite inflammatory reaction on some of the hemorrhage. This composed of appear to be activated glial cells, foamy macrophages, possibly other inflammatory cells. 30 Cerebellum - there are scattered dead red neurons in the Purkinje cell layer. The deep white matter is markedly vacuolated; changes leave is real due to the presence of swollen. Large neurons within this area. 31 Missing 32 DECAL ­ this decaled specimen is a section of very dense woven bone.

ANCILLARY DIAGNOSTICS: Photos YES Radiographs/X-ray Other Imaging ___________________ Where taken / stored? AVPS computer and NMFS. COMMENTS (CAUSE OF DEATH, INTERPRETATIONS): Because of the sand and mud deep in the lungs and a histologic reaction to this material, this animal aspirated while stranded, most likely aspirated mud. She also had an ongoing pneumonia due to parasites, but this was most likely a condition she was living with successfully. Lungs will be sent to Lena Measures and student to evaluate lung worm load. She was pregnant and though she was relatively fresh, the fetus was quite rotten. That could have happened by the fetus dying first and contributing to the death of the mother, or could have been due to the fetus dying first during the course of the stranding, or perhaps the fetus "cooked" in the well insulated mother's tissues. A work up on the fetus for typical infectious causes of abortion did not find any significant pathogens and I suspect the fetus died as a result of the death of the mother. Microbiology was performed and no significant pathogens were found to explain the death or stranding. Antibiotic sensitivities were run on the Fecal E. coli to look for evidence of contact with human origin bacteria altered by exposures to antibiotics. The E coli from the beluga were uniformly sensitive to all tested antibiotics. Histopathology also demonstrated neuronal necrosis consistent with hypoxemia and also showed marked congestion and subdural hemorrhages, most likely due to the cardiovascular stresses occurring in a stranded cetacean. Just for thoroughness-sake, a second opinion was be obtained from another marine mammal pathologist, Dr. D. Rottstein. He did not have any further comments to add to my analysis. Samples have been submitted for heavy metal and nutritional analysis (kidney and liver) , POPs, fatty acids and stable isotopes (Blubber and skin), genetics (skin in DMSO), prey analysis (stomach contents). Amniotic fluid was negative for Saxitoxin and Domoic acid. Archives have been submitted to the Museum of the North. See tissue disposition and types in the table below.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. (End of clause) 5. 1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause) 6. 1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. (End of clause)

(i) The offeror certifies that each end product, except those listed in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this provision, is a U.S.-made or designated country end product, as defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Trade Agreements." (ii) The offeror shall list as other end products those end products that are not U.S.-made or designated country end products.

The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) |_| Are, |_| are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) |_| Have, |_| have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) |_| Are, |_| are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in pa ragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) |_| Have, |_| have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (1) Listed end products. Listed End Product Country of Origin __________ __________ __________ __________ (2) Certification. |_| (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. |_| (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-(1) |_| In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or (2) |_| Outside the United States.

The offeror |_| does |_| does not certify that--

The offeror |_| does |_| does not certify that-(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause appliesż (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 8. 52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAY 2011) (a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause, which is incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). __________ Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C.7104(g)).

Statement of Work
TITLE: Cook Inlet Beluga Whale Stranding Data Management and Reporting System BACKGROUND: In 2008, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Alaska Region (AKR) listed the Cook Inlet (CI) beluga whale as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA). Much information (biological, geographical, etc.) has been collected during the last 30 years from stranded and hunter harvested beluga whales. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this contract is to create a CI beluga data management and reporting system for National Marine Fisheries Service Alaska Region's, Division of Protected Resources (PRD). TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: The NMFS Alaska web server is a Windows 2008 server running IIS 7. Access to the NMFS AKR Oracle database will be granted to the contractor and the Cook Inlet Beluga Whale Stranding Data Management and Reporting System will be run on the NMFS approved application server. SCOPE OF WORK: The contractor shall: 1. Collaborate with NMFS AKR CI beluga whale managers, the CI beluga data manager, and AKR database programmers to design and implement a data management and reporting system that conforms to AKR technical specifications requirement (as stated above) 2. Create a secure database, with restricted web-based queries, reports and interfaces, as specified 3. Create user accounts for AKR staff to use the website and data entry forms, and guest accounts that researchers can use to query data via the website, but not input data. 4. Support the CI beluga data manager with data entry, troubleshooting and fixing errors in the data. Contractor will not be responsible for actual data entry. 5. Provide training and technical documentation to the NMFS AKR staff and the CI beluga data manager on the use of the database and web interface. 6. Fix errors and non-working components of the database, as needed, for a period of three months after the completion of the database. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES/TASKS: The contractor shall create a data management and reporting system that will house all records pertaining to stranded and hunter-harvested CI beluga whales. The system shall, at a minimum: 1. Be built in Oracle, NMFS' AKR relational database standard, and host beluga stranding and harvest data - which is currently on paper (not electronic) and in jpg files. 2. Be extensible, giving system developers the ability to enhance the data storage, querying, and reporting capabilities to accommodate future requirements. 3. Include web input forms for data entry (Attachments A and B). Web input forms need to include all fields in the Level A standard form, as well as the ability to upload photos (up to 20 for each animal). 4. Restrict access via user accounts for AKR staff and AKR approved researchers (guest accounts) that can be reset and created by staff database programmers once the site is active. AKR staff shall be the only users entering data. Researchers would only be using the web-based query tools. 5. Allow NMFS AKR staff with user-accounts to make web-based, sort-able queries of Level A data and yes/no queries of Level B data.

6. Generate .jpg maps displaying the lat/long locations of specific beluga whale strandings that NMFS staff can save and use in their work (not store in the database). 7. Include reports for NMFS staff use and additional simplified reports for the public on a public web site. a. A large amount of the CI beluga data, especially harvest data, is not public. The public web report shall only include the following stranding data: beluga gender, location, date, number of animals and age class. Excel and/or HTML reports for the public are needed and can be linked to or displayed on a simple, public strandings website. The AKR NMFS webmaster will provide a template for the page design. b. AKR staff needs the contractor to generate Excel reports of Level A and B stranding and harvest data (per #5 above) and .jpg maps of stranding location lat/longs (per #6 above).

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.59 per hour or $143.60 per week or $622.27 per month VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees

Page 8 of 10

who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work). HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **
If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"

Page 9 of 10
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD horne page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WOOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
