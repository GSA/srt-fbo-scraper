C.1. BACKGROUND

The Department of Defense (DoD) established the Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP) in 1990 to improve accessibility for people
with disabilities throughout the DoD and remove the cost of accommodations. The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), a field activity in the
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), serves as the executive agent for CAP. CAP is housed at TMA's Office of the Chief
Information Officer (OCIO). CAP's mission is to provide assistive technology and accommodations to ensure people with disabilities and wounded
service members have equal access to the information technology environment and opportunities throughout the Federal Government. In October
2000, the National Defense Authorization Act granted CAP the authority to provide assistive technology, devices, and services to any department
or agency in the Federal Government upon the request of the head of the agency. Via this authority, CAP is the Federal Government's centrally
funded accommodations program, providing assistive technology solutions at no cost to the requesting agency. Much of CAP's success lies in the
ability to provide assistive technology and reasonable accommodations to employees quickly and easily, which can increase employment and
retention of employees with disabilities.

On October 17, 2006, the National Defense Authorization Act granted CAP the authority to provide assistive technology to wounded/injured service
members allowing them to retain the equipment upon separation. CAP provides the assistive technology to the service members and coordinates the
service as outlined in the Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6025.22.  Since the inception of CAP, procurement of information technology
management support services provided best administrative value to CAP as it expanded and provided over 12,000 service requests for assistive
technology and accommodation to 68 Federal agency partners and wounded Service members in Fiscal Year 2010.

F.7    52.247-34  F.O.B. DESTINATION  (NOV 1991)
47.303-6

(a)   The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this clause, means—

      (1)   Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier's conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee's facility
       (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and

      (2)   Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee's wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export),
       warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery,
       storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier
       tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual
       capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier
       (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the
       supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight."  When
       supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be
       performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested.  If the Contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarder
       for less than carload shipments, the Contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer
       to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.

(b)   The Contractor shall—

      (1)   (i)  Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or

            (ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;

      (2)   Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;

      (3)   Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;

      (4)   Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery
       point specified in the contract;

      (5)   Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and

      (6)   Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.

   * Individual orders may specify different times for the delivery of these items.













F.9. NOTICE REGARDING LATE DELIVERY

The Contractor shall notify the COR(s) as soon as it becomes apparent to the Contractor that a scheduled delivery will be late. The contractor
shall include in the notification the rationale for late delivery and the expected date for the delivery. The COR(s) will review the new
schedule and provide guidance to the contractor via a modification to the order. Such notification in no way limits the Government's right to
any and all rights and remedies up to and including termination of the order.


G.1  Proof of Delivery:

To secure payment, the vendor shall provide proof of delivery and signed acceptance receipt of package along with the invoice. Vendor should
EITHER provide a spreadsheet to include, at a minimum; recipient name, item(s) sent, mailing tracking number, and mailing carrier OR individual
invoice that includes the mailing tracking number and carrier via attachment to the WAWF system, email, or fax.

G.2  Payment

The Contractor shall submit invoice information into WAWF no later than the 20th of each month for all orders processed within the month.
Contractors shall NOT submit separate charges per individual shipment.  The invoice submitted shall total the cost stipulated in each individual
order.

G.3.      252.232-7003    ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUESTS AND RECEIVING REPORTS (MAR 2008)

      (a)  Definitions.  As used in this clause—

            (1)  “Contract financing payment” and “invoice payment” have the meanings given in section 32.001 of the Federal Acquisition
Regulation.

            (2)  “Electronic form” means any automated system that transmits information electronically from the initiating system to all
affected systems.  Facsimile, e-mail, and scanned documents are not acceptable electronic forms for submission of payment requests.  However,
scanned documents are acceptable when they are part of a submission of a payment request made using Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) or another
electronic form authorized by the Contracting Officer.

            (3)  “Payment request” means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this
contract.

      (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit payment requests and receiving reports using WAWF, in
one of the following electronic formats that WAWF accepts:  Electronic Data Interchange, Secure File Transfer Protocol, or World Wide Web input.
 Information regarding WAWF is available on the Internet at https://wawf.eb.mil/.

      (c)  The Contractor may submit a payment request and receiving report using other than WAWF only when—

      (1)  The Contracting Officer authorizes use of another electronic form.  With such an authorization, the Contractor and the Contracting
Officer shall agree to a plan, which shall include a timeline, specifying when the Contractor will transfer to WAWF;

      (2)  DoD is unable to receive a payment request or provide acceptance in electronic form;

      (3)  The Contracting Officer administering the contract for payment has determined, in writing, that electronic submission would be unduly
burdensome to the Contractor.  In such cases, the Contractor shall include a copy of the Contracting Officer’s determination with each request
for payment; or

      (4)  DoD makes payment for commercial transportation services provided under a Government rate tender or a contract for transportation
services using a DoD-approved electronic third party payment system or other exempted contractor payment/invoicing system (e.g., PowerTrack,
Transportation Financial Management System, and Cargo and Billing System).

      (d)  The Contractor shall submit any non-electronic payment requests using the method or methods specified in Section G of the contract.

      (e)  In addition to the requirements of this clause, the Contractor shall meet the requirements of the appropriate payment clauses in this
contract when submitting payment requests.
                                                    (End of Clause)

G.4  IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUEST

To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, "ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUEST (MAR 2008)", TRICARE Management Services utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow-
Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) to electronically process contractor requests for payment. This application allows DoD contractors to submit
and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically.

The contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports under this contract/order, unless the provision
at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The contractor shall (i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor
Registration at http://www.ccr.gov and (ii) register to use WAWF-RA at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award
of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.

The contractor is directed to use the “2-in-1” format when processing invoices and receiving reports (Choose the appropriate format based on the
following:
|When entering the invoice into WAWF-RA, the contractor shall fill in the following  |See Page One (1),                                              |

The TMA contemplates award of  Blanket Purchase Agreement(s), (multiple BPAs maybe award) with Firm Fixed Price CLINs.
I.5  Option To Extend The Term Of The Contract (April 1996)

(a) The Government may extend the term of this BPA by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government shall give
the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does
not commit the Government to an extension.
(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended BPA shall be considered to include this option provision.
(c) The total duration of this BPA, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 years and 6 months.

I.6     Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer- Central Contractor Registration (February 2009)
(a) Method of payment.
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)
of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either"
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of
this clause).

(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central
Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the
updated information to the CCR database.

(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the
rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH
are contained in 31 CFR Part 210.

(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to
the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request
shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract
regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.

(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government
remains responsible for"
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of
Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and"
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is
responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of
this clause shall apply.

(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this
contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment
is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.

(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of
this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR
database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment
to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims, is not
permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows
the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the
Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.

(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT
information made by the Contractor's financial agent.

(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for
transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to
designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of
executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment
office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by
check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in
the CCR database.

This Urgent and Compelling and Brand Name Justification is issued pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5 – “Test Program for Certain
Commercial Items’   FY2011 – Purchase of supplies and services to provide assistive technology and accommodations to ensure people with
disabilities and wounded Service members have equal access to the information technology environment and opportunities in Department of Defense
(DoD) and throughout the Federal Government.

1.  Contracting Activity:  This Urgent and Compelling and Brand Name Justification is prepared under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5 – “Test
Program for Certain Commercial Items on behalf of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), a field activity in the Office of the Assistant
Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), serves as the agent for Computer/Electronic Accommodations Program (CAP).  This justification will permit
the acquisition of Urgent and Compelling FAR 6.302-2 and Brand-Name 6.302-1(c),  supplies/products and services for specific information
technology products and services from numerous companies without advertising each requirement issued against one or more Blanket Purchase
Agreements (BPA).

2.  Description of Action:  This justification documents CAP’s need to acquire Urgent and Compelling, and commercial brand-name specific
information technology products and services from numerous companies required in support of wounded Service members and Federal Government
employees (DoD and 68 Partners) with disabilities including  cognitive, dexterity, vision, hearing and/or communication impairments.  This
requirement for specific name brand products is predominantly the result ofspecific needs assessments made by medical professionals.

3.  Anticipated Value:  The BPA will be issued with $0.  The IGCE based on historical data is valued at a minimum of approximately $473,901.71
Base Year; $477,382.66 Option Year 1; $483,916.82 Option Year 2; $486,184.18 Option Year 3; and, $488,937.65OptionYear 4.

4.  Authority:  This justification is authorized by FAR Subpart 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, FAR 6.302-2 Urgent and
Compelling and FAR 6.302-1(c), Brand-Name.

5.  Reason(s) to Support Authority Cited:

A.  In October 2000, the National Defense Authorization Act granted CAP the authority to provide assistive technology, products, supplies and
services to any department or agency in the Federal Government upon the request of the head of the agency.  Based upon this authority, CAP is
the Federal Government’s centrally funded accommodations program, providing assistive technology solution at no cost to the requesting agency.

B.  On October 17, 2006, the National Defense Authorization Act granted CAP the authority to provide assistive technology to wounded Service
members allowing them to retain the equipment upon separation.  CAP provides the assistive technology to the Service members and coordinates the
service outlined in the Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 6025.22.  Since the inception of CAP, procurement of assistive technology
andsupport services expanded and filled over 12,000 request for assistive technology and accommodation services for employees with disabilities,
and to 68 Federal agency partners and wounded Service members in Fiscal Year 2010.

C.  As many of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines return from deployment in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) formerly referred to as
Global War on Terror, with injuries, service providers at Military Treatment Facilities continue to ensure the highest quality of care and
transition support services.  As they are recovering from injuries sustained, these Service members also plan for their next assignments or
jobs.  Therapists conduct examinations of their functional limitations and frequently recommend brand name assistive technology and/or services
based on the particular injury or disability in the areas of dexterity, vision, hearing, and cognitive or communication.   The brand name
assistive technology and/or services recommended are based on the therapist’s examinations and their advice as to the product that is uniquely
capable of meeting and supporting the needs of the injured Service member.

D.  It is necessary to continue to purchase assistive technology and services, as they evolve, to eliminate workplace barriers and provide these
individuals with the proper tools they need allowing them to be productive and perform the essential functions/task of the job.  These barriers
may be physical obstacles (such as inaccessible facilities or equipment), or they may be procedures or rules such as concerning about
performance schedules, timing of breaks or how essential or marginal functions are performed.  The assistive technology and services purchased
removes workplace barrier for individuals with disabilities.

E.  The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) time frame for processing requests (including providing accommodation, if approved)
is as soon as possible but no later than 30 business days from the date the request is made.  This 30-day period includes the 10-day time frame
in which the Disability Program Manager (DPM) must contact the requestor after a request for reasonable accommodation is made.  The 30-day time
frame indicates the maximum amount of time it should generally take to process a request and provide a reasonable accommodation.  The time frame
begins when an oral or written request for reasonable accommodations is made, and not necessarily when it is received by the DPM.  Therefore,
every one involved in processing a request shall respond as quickly as possible.  The CAP processing time is 10-15 working days.  The EEOC’s
Policy Guidance on Executive Order 13164 Establishing Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation states “Agency
procedures must permit flexibility in the processing of request and assure that agency officials act expeditiously in providing reasonable
accommodations.  An agency may permit different components of the agency to adopt their own procedures as necessary to expedite the processing
of reasonable accommodation request)” These assistive technology solutions and/or services are provided for reasonable accommodations to
employees quickly and easily, which increases employment and retention of employees with disabilities.

F.  This justification will permit the acquisition of brand-name assistive technology products and services for specific accommodations and
services from numerous companies without advertising each requirement issued against multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.

G.  Delay in award of a contract would result in serious conflict of regulations and policy in the Government.  The National Defense
Authorization Act; The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1973, as amended; Assistive Technology Act
of 1998; or Enforcement Guidance - Reasonable Accommodation and undue hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Acts policies and guides
can not be expedited within the time frame stipulated in these and other Government’s guidelines and regulations.  Also Federal agencies will
not be fully compliant with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Individuals with disabilities will not have equal access to all
employment opportunities; and individuals with disabilities requiring assistive technology and/or services may not be able to maintain their
employment and career advancement for which the individuals have received training and/or employment.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:

TMA COD anticipates it will continue researching brand name assistive technology and service recommended by CAP customers and medical
professionals for new technology, unless other viable alternative solutions are identified.  To date, many of the assistive technology and/or
services were previously purchased by the CAP Office through Government Credit Card transactions.  However, this authority has been suspended
and the responsibility has been shifted to COD acquisition office.

7.  Price reasonableness:  Prices were compared to the Independent Government Cost Estimate.  The Contracting Office will ensure through cost
and price analysis and contract negotiations that all costs are fair and reasonable.

8.  Certification:  I certify that this requirement meets the government’s minimum needs and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for
this justification is complete and accurate.

TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL’S CERTIFICATION
