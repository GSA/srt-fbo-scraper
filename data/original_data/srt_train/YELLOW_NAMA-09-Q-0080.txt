This is a combined synopsis/solicitation issued for brand name commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined
Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Methods, as supplemented with additional
information included in this notice and justified in accordance with the procedures required by FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for brand name
descriptions.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a firm fixed price quotation is requested and a written solicitation will
not be issued.  The solicitation number is NAMA-09-Q-0080 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The RFQ and incorporated provisions
and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33, effective Jun 15, 2009.  This is a Full and Open, Brand Name Only
solicitation under NAICS 561621 with a size standard of $12.5 million. The Government intends to issue an order based on initial quotations
without discussions. Evaluation and order issuance will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition,
Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation.  Best value for this order will be evaluated based on a lowest price technically
acceptable evaluation.  In order to be determined technically acceptable, all quotation submission requirements must be met including the
required documentation outlined below.  BACKGROUND:  The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has the requirement to maintain and
update the existing Enhanced Software Support for the Honeywell Prowatch Security System.  The Honeywell Prowatch Security System is a computer
based system used to identify Government Employees and Government Contractors, to monitor access to NARA’s Archives II location, and to maintain
a history file of all security activities.  This software is for operating Security Control System, Card Access Control and for monitoring high
security areas at the National Archives II only.  This requirement is for proprietary software updates, product support and technical training
that can only be obtained from the manufacturer or the manufacturer’s re-sellers.  REQUIREMENTS:  This is a Brand Name, firm-fixed price RFQ
with a base period of performance of 12 months, beginning with the end date of the warranty period, with four 12 month option periods.  All
delivery costs must be included in the total firm-fixed price quote.  NARA requires brand certified service because of the proprietary nature of
specialized systems and the lack of compatibility among competing products.  Also, NARA requires that any and all vendors submitting quotes
shall provide proof of authorization from Honeywell.  This is a request for quote and quotations furnished are not offers.  This request does
not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in the preparations of the submission of this quotation or to contract for supplies or
services.  Any representations and/or certifications attached to this request for quotation must be completed by the Vendor.  FOB destination
pricing is requested.  Vendors must ensure that the products meet the requirements of Section 508, as applicable.
