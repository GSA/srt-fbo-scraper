      6.10.7 Subtask 7 - Program Protection Working Group (PPWG): The Contractor shall host a PPWG within three months after contract award and
      on an annual basis throughout period of performance of the contract. Each PPWG will be chaired by the Government security manager and co-
      chaired by the Contractor security manager. The co-chair shall develop the agenda. The agenda shall include critical functional analysis
      (CFA), and Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM). It is expected that each of the PPWGs will be a one day event.


      6.10.8 Subtask 8 - Anti-Tamper (AT) Plan: If Anti-Tamper is identified as a solution for hardware and software containing CT, the
      Contractor shall design, develop and integrate an AT solution to deter/prevent/detect the reverse engineering of those systems using the
      probability of an unplanned loss or for international sales across the program's life cycle. The Contractor shall take the AT solutions
      through verification and testing to include any prototypes. The Contractor shall utilize reverse engineering countermeasures that are
      commensurate with the exposure levels and consequence of critical program information loss using the analysis process identified within the
      DoD AT Guidelines.


      6.10.9 Subtask 9 - AT Program: The Contractor shall develop and implement an AT Program to protect CT. The Contractor shall develop,
      utilize, and maintain an AT Plan Annex to address protection of CT from reverse engineering in the case of unplanned loss or international
      sale. The Contractor shall develop an AT Plan Annex to the PPIP for documenting countermeasure designs. The Contractor shall consider AT in
      system engineering activities across the program’s life cycle to include science and technology efforts, research, design, development,
      implementation, testing, maintenance, upgrade and disposal of the system.


      6.10.10 Subtask 10 - Security Plan (Supply Chain Risk Management Security Controls): The contractor shall submit for Government approval as
      part of their overarching security plan, describe their strategy for implementation of Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Security
      requirements throughout the life of the contract. The security plan shall address the security controls (at a minimum SA-12) described in
      National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4 (current version), Recommended Security Controls
      for Federal Information Systems and Organizations (http://csrc.mist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html), and should be tailored in scope and
      depth appropriate to the effort and the specific unclassified DOD information.


      6.10.11 Subtask 11 - Law Enforcement/Counterintelligence: In the event of a known or potential intrusion, the contractor shall consent to
      responding counterintelligence or law enforcement investigative agency requests to apply forensic analysis tools to contractor information
      systems affected by the intrusion, including monitoring tools, imaging tools, and any other techniques that the agency seeks to apply to
      effectively analyze the intrusion. The contractor shall allow the responding counterintelligence and/or law enforcement investigative
      agency to image affected systems, including systems containing proprietary information. Nothing in this contract shall limit the ability to
      conduct law enforcement or counterintelligence activities, or other activities in the interest of the Government.


      6.10.12 Subtask 12 - Information Sharing: The Government may use and disclose reported information (e.g., information regarding threats,
      vulnerabilities, incidents, or best practices) that does not include attribution information at its discretion to assist entities in
      protecting information or information systems (e.g. threat information products, threat assessment reports); provided that such use or
      disclosure is otherwise authorized in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, and policies.


      6.10.13 Subtask 13 – Malicious Code Warranty: The contractor represents and warrants that the software shall be free from all computer
      viruses, worms, time-outs, time bombs, back doors, disabling devices and other harmful or malicious code intended to or which may damage,
      disrupt, inconvenience or permit access to the software user's or another's software, hardware, networks, data or information.


      6.10.14 Subtask 14 – Source Code Configuration Control (Versioning): The contractor shall utilize a strict version control process for
      software development and provide two copies of source code for all software versions developed under this contract. The source code will be
      provided on optical removable media (burned for read only) or another mutually agreed type of media.


      6.10.15 Subtask 15 – Source Code Analysis: To minimize both SCRM and IA related threats, the contractor shall use appropriate automated
      vulnerability analysis tools capable of analyzing the computer software code during the entire lifecycle of a covered system; including
      during development (source code analysis), operational testing (run-time analysis/vulnerability testing), and ongoing operations and
      sustainment phase (vulnerability testing).  The actions will be used to identify and prioritize security vulnerabilities and, based on
      risk, determine appropriate remediation strategies for identified vulnerabilities.


      6.10.16 Subtask 16 – Non-Secure Software: If the Government determines, after a security audit (e.g. ST&E), that software delivered under
      this task order is non-secure, the Government will provide written notice to the contractor of each non-conformity. Software shall be "non-
      secure" under this task order if it contains a programming error listed on the current approved version of the CWE/SANS TOP 25 (which can
      be located at http://www.sans.org/top25-programming-errors) or a web application security flaw listed on the current approved version of
      the OWASP Top Ten (which can be located at http: //www.owasp.org/index.php/Category: OWASP Top_Ten_Project). The contractor shall have
      thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice (Remedy Period) to remedy each non-conformity by modifying/replacing and redelivering the
      software to the Government; or shall notify the Government within 15 days as to why the remedy cannot be implemented in 30 days, and
      propose a timeline for correction. If the Government determines, after a security audit following a Remedy Period, that the redelivered
      software is non-secure, and thus non-conforming, the Government may reject the delivery, provide notice of the non-conformance, and
      document the contractor's performance record. Alternatively, the Government may accept non-conforming software, receive appropriate
      consideration (equitable price reduction on a fixed price contract, reimbursement for costs of security audit,
      reimbursement for costs to correct the non-compliances, etc.), and document the contractor's performance record


      6.10.17 Subtask 17 – Periodic Government Inspections: The contractor shall authorize Government inspections and reviews to assure
      compliance with both DISA and DoD Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) requirements throughout the contract performance period. The
      contractor shall be responsible for taking corrective action based upon the impact and severity of identified weaknesses.
      Supply Chain Risk and Basic Protections Development: The contractor shall establish basic protection requirements unless not establishing
      such requirements is justified by a cost-benefit analysis approved by the Government. Supply Chain and Development basic protections shall
      include:
        •  An Anonymity Plan that:
               ✓ Limits the disclosure of the baseline design, test and supply chain data
               ✓ Use blinds buys for component procurement
        •  Additional access controls that:
               ✓ Further limit access to critical components and information about critical components beyond normal program control
               ✓ Log access
               ✓ Establish data collection for post attack forensic analysis
               ✓ Require inspection and approval of changes
        •  Third party software assurance and supply chain attack testing of system, development environment, and the critical function supply
        chain.


      Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI): FOCI is the U.S. government’s program that ensures companies with foreign ownership,
      working in the United States, will not compromise the security or integrity of sensitive government agencies and materials. The contractor
      must demonstrate that neither they nor their subcontractors/suppliers have any Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) issues (A SF
      328 “Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests” is used to determine whether or not a company is under FOCI).

8.  Incentives.  The Delivery Incentives/Disincentives associated with work performed under this PWS are detailed below:

8.1 Delivery Incentives.

8.1.1 After the initial delivery of contract equipment and for new equipment that may be added after the original PWS and QASP through normal
contract modification,  the Contractor will receive an incentive of 1% of the first, full 30-day cost of an individual expedited call order when
Unisys OS 2200 capacity is delivered prior to the performance standards defined in Attachment J-4 QASP.  This incentive will only apply to
orders that require expedited delivery as designated by the Government. The 1% incentive will be calculated on the first, full 30-day billing of
the expedited call order and will be paid only on the first month of billing for the expedited call order.   The designation that the call order
is eligible for the incentive will be made in the call order.  The measurement to determine if the incentive was achieved will be the date of
delivery on the receipt of the “Ready-for-Use” email.  Both the date of delivery and the email will need to be submitted prior to the next
monthly billing cycle for the incentive to be achieved.

8.1.1.1 An expedited delivery call order will be identified by the Government to meet specific Unisys OS 2200 capacity orders. Expedited
delivery is defined as new hardware delivered to satisfy a government-requested expedited call order within 15 business days from call order
date to ready-for-use.

|Expedited Delivery Date                     |Incentive                                      |Disincentive                                   |
|Ready-for-Use Date (day 1-15)               |Yes                                            |No                                             |
|Ready-for-Use Date (day 16-30)              |No                                             |No                                             |
|Ready-for-Use Date (after day 30)           |No                                             |Yes                                            |


Table 8.1 - Expedited Delivery Table

8.1.1.2 In cases where the Government has requested expedited delivery of a call order and then modifies the call order while the Contractor is
working to meet the expedited delivery request, the Government will reset the expedited delivery timeline.  The effective order date will be
updated to the date the call order modification is issued.

8.2 Delivery Disincentives:

8.2.1 The Contractor will be charged a disincentive fee of -1% of the first, full 30-day cost of an individual call order when storage capacity
is delivered after the performance standards defined in Attachment J-4 QASP.  This fee will only apply to orders that require expedited delivery
as designated by the Government.  The -1% fee will be calculated on the first, full 30-day billing of the expedited call order and will be
charged only on the first month of billing for the expedited order.

8.3 The PWS and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) may be modified to identify performance objectives and standards for new equipment
and services that may be added to the original PWS and QASP through normal contract modification as required

9.  Place of Performance.  The solutions shall be designed, delivered, installed, and supported in concert with the Government at any of the
current seventeen (17) DISA ESD data centers or future DISA ESD in the continental United States (CONUS) and DISA ESD outside CONUS (OCONUS)
data center in Germany, and other DISA or DISA approved locations worldwide in which DISA ESD may acquire an operational responsibility.

10.  Period of Performance.  The period of performance for this contract will be a one (1) year base period with four (4), one (1) year renewal
options for a total lifecycle of five (5) years. The one (1) year base period will begin 01 December 2014 and end 30 September 2015.  The
renewal options, years two (2) through  five (5) of the contract,  will each begin 01 October and end the following 30 September.  As directed
by the COR, the contractor shall continue performance in emergency or mission essential conditions.  Additionally, the contractor may be
required to account for the whereabouts of their personnel should this information be requested by the COR.

IMPORTANT NOTE: For internal DISA contract users, you are highly discouraged from specifying that work must be performed within Government
facilities, unless absolutely necessary. If work must be performed in Government spaces, a written waiver request must be submitted and approved
by MPS7. Contact Ms. Jeanette Boyd for further information regarding waiver format and procedures at (301) 225-1323.

The following paragraph is required when the contractor performs work on-site at a government facility.

Alternate Place of Performance - Contingency Only.  As determined by the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR), contractor employees may be
required to work at an alternate place of performance (e.g., home, the contractor's facility, or another approved activity within the local
travel area)  in cases of unforeseen conditions or contingencies (e.g., pandemic conditions, exercises, government closure due to inclement
weather, etc.).  Non-emergency/non-essential contractors should not report to a closed government facility.   Contractor shall prepare all
deliverables and other contract documentation utilizing contractor resources.  To the extent possible, the contractor shall use best efforts to
provide the same level of support as stated in the PWS.  In the event the services are impacted, reduced, compromised, etc., the Contracting
Officer or the contractor may request an equitable adjustment pursuant to the Changes clause of the contract.

12.  Security.

   12.1 Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 8500.1, Information Assurance (IA), requires that “all IA and IA-enabled IT  products  incorporated
   into DoD information systems shall be configured in accordance with DOD-approved security configuration guidelines.”  DISA Instruction 630 230
   31 assigns the DISA Deputy Director for Operations with the responsibility to develop and maintain Security  Technical  Implementation  Guides
   (STIGs).  These STIGs (or Addendum, as appropriate) serve as the security configuration guidelines required by DoD  8500.1.   DoD  8500.1  has
   been supplemented with additional information concerning specific operating system environments including the Microsoft  Windows  NT,  Windows
   2000, Windows 2003 and Windows XP operating systems. The contractor will follow  all  Security  Technical  Implementation  Guide  (STIGs)  and
   Sharing Peripheral Across Network (SPAN) guidelines documented on http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/index.html.

      12.1.1 DoD 8500.2 provided details of implementing the requirements of DoD8500.1, including FIPS 140-2 certification.

      12.1.2 The MSC (Montgomery Support Center) partition supporting Quality Assurance (QA) for integration, throughput and load testing will be
      compliant with all applicable STIGs to ensure total product integration for DISA Unisys OS 2200 environments at Oklahoma City,  Ogden,  and
      St Louis.  Unisys will coordinate with DISA to ensure SRR scripts and updates to the STIG are available to the MSC system.

   12.2 DISA utilizes classified and controlled unclassified information to accomplish mission objectives.  Contractor personnel exposed to  this
   level of information must protect the data through the use of the security features inherent to software  loaded,  strong  authentication  and
   physical constraints as stated in 12.3 and 12.4.  Any deviation from  standard  practices  may  compromise  data  resulting  in  harm  to  the
   government.

   12.3 DISA’s operating facilities security is  multi-faceted  and  implemented  utilizing  the  layered  approach.   The  traditional  security
   requirements such as perimeters being patrolled, stationary guards assigned, approved access devices such  as  locks,  card  readers,  badges,
   access logs and detection devices are physical controls implemented to deter unauthorized access.  Information  controls  render  a  different
   challenge by protecting automated sensitive data and associated resources from unauthorized access.  Accounts are established after registered
   personnel meet access and/or clearance levels necessary for position.  Through awareness training,  directives  and  local  policy  contracted
   personnel are expected to comply with local security requirements up holding physical and information system security disciplines.

   12.4 When hardware is no longer required, for any reason, the government will ensure the media (hard drives, mass storage devices,  etc.)  are
   sanitized in accordance with appropriate regulations.  If the media cannot be sanitized and rendered to the unclassified level, the media  may
   be returned to the contractor in an unusable state or retained by the Government at no cost.  This process is  to  ensure  the  protection  of
   controlled unclassified and classified information.

   12.5 Hard disk drives removed from the subsystems in this agreement must be certified by the Government to be  processed  in  compliance  with
   Assistant Secretary of Defense Memorandum, Subject:  Disposition of Unclassified DoD Computer Hard Drives, dated June 4, 2001.  There are  two
   basic scenarios to consider:


      (1)  Overwrite of hard disks is not required if a removed hard drive is operable and to be relocated on site.
      (2)  Overwrite is required if a removed hard drive is:
       (a)  operable and to be redirected to another DISA site;
       (b)  operable and to be removed permanently from DISA;
       (c)  or inoperable and to be taken out of DISA.


      If scenario 2(c) occurs, then the contractor shall certify in writing that the drive has been sanitized or disposed of in  accordance  with
      the Assistant Secretary of Defense Memorandum.  (See DoD Memorandum’s Atch 1, para 3.2 for details.)

   12.6 Personnel under this contract may have maintenance responsibilities for and access to systems with a relatively high risk for causing
   damage to Government facilities, systems and/or data if compromised.  All persons rendering services under this contract must be a US Citizen,
   have and maintain a minimum SECRET clearance resulting from a favorably completed National Agency Check with Local Agency and Credit Check
   (NCLC) prior to performance of duties.  An interim SECRET clearance granted by the appropriate agency is acceptable pending completion of
   investigation and adjudication of the subject’s access request.  Given these circumstances and provided interim clearance granted meets
   required access level per contract.  A local determination to grant access to facility, systems and/or data outlined by this contract may be
   approved by DISA site commander and/or designated representative.

   12.7 The work to be performed under this contract is up to and including the Secret level and positions are IT-I for systems access.  The
   company must have a minimum final Secret Facility Clearance (FCL) from the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO).  For
   contractor employees, it requires a minimum of final Secret security clearance and interim IT-I eligibility when performance starts.  This
   section shall be considered a supplement to block 13 of the Government provided DD 254, Contract Classification Specification.

   12.8 Personnel performing duties under this contract must undergo a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) as a
   minimum investigation.  The SSBI will be maintained current within 5-years and requests for Special Background Periodic Review (SBPR) will be
   initiated 6-months prior to the 5-year anniversary date of the previous SSBI or SBPR.

   12.9 Adjudication for granting of interim and final IT-I access will be accomplished through DISA Security.  An exception to this is that
   individual contractor employees with an SSBI or SBPR (within a 5-year scope) that was favorably adjudicated for a Top Secret security
   clearance or IT-I access by any of the Department of Defense adjudication facilities (DISCO, DIA, ACCF, AFCAF, NAVCAF, WHSCAF) will be
   automatically accepted for final IT-I access.  All personnel performing on this contract will be U.S. citizens.

   12.10 Pending completion of a SSBI and final adjudication for security clearance, contractor employees may be granted interim authorization to
   perform duties designated as IT-I. The interim authority for IT sensitive positions is the DISA Personnel Security Office. Following are the
   requirements, which must be met prior to granting of interim IT-I authorization.

   12.11 The request for SSBI, thru e-QIP, must be submitted by DISA Personnel Security to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The
   contracting company WILL NOT submit contractors for Secret IT-I contracts. The e-QIP will be initiated and reviewed by DISA Personnel Security
   and approved for Interim access if the contractor has a previously favorable NAC and a favorably reviewed SSBI e-QIP. If the contractor DOES
   NOT have a previously favorable NAC the e-QIP will be reviewed, if there are issues on the case the process will stop and the contracting
   company will supply a new contractor to fill the position. If the case has no issues it will be submitted to OPM. Once the NAC portion closes
   FAVORABLY, an Interim IT-I will be granted. This process takes approximately 2-4 weeks once submitted to OPM. If at any time there are issues
   on the NAC portion of the SSBI, the investigation will be cancelled and a new contractor will be supplied by the company.



   12.12 The National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the SSBI or a previous valid NCLC/DNACI/NAC or ENTNAC must be completed and favorably
   adjudicated before interim IT-I access will be granted. Advance NAC results should be requested and the DISA Security Manager should be
   notified of this fact in writing.  An interim Secret security clearance should also be requested by the contractor FSO for those contractor
   employees without a previous investigation or security clearance.

   12.13 For contractors that are submitting SBPR’s or SSBI’s that have a previously favorable NAC and have a new issue reflected on the e-QIP
   that is submitted to DISA, each case will be reviewed and approved or found ineligible by DISA Personnel Security on a case by case basis.

   12.14 All new contractor employees are not cleared to report for work until they are cleared through DISA Security.

   12.15 The Contractor will forward a Visit Authorization Letter (VAL) to the Contracting Officer’s Representative by fax or secure email for
   all employees prior to the beginning of each contracting/task order period of performance and as new contractor employees are assigned to the
   contract.

   12.16 The Contractor will forward a Visit Authorization Letter (VAL) to the Contracting Officer’s Representative/Task Monitor at the following
   address for all employees prior to the beginning of each contracting/task order period of performance and as new contractor employees are

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours
As prescribed in 4.804 (S-90), insert the following clause:

                                           CONTRACT/ORDER CLOSEOUT—FIXED-PRICE, TIME-AND-MATERIALS, OR
                                                              LABOR-HOURS (JAN 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order. The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order. A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification. A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order. If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an

(a)  An offeror shall identify in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, any potential or actual Organizational and Consultant
Conflicts of Interest (OCCI) as described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  This includes actual or potential conflicts of interests of proposed
subcontractors.  If an offeror identifies in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, a potential or actual conflict of interests the
offeror shall submit an Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest Plan (OCCIP) to the contracting officer.  The OCCIP shall describe
how the offeror addresses potential or actual conflicts of interest and identify how they will avoid, neutralize, or mitigate present or future
conflicts of interest.

(b)  Offerors must consider whether their involvement and participation raises any OCCI issues, especially in the following areas when:

     (1)  Providing systems engineering and technical direction.

     (2)  Preparing specifications or work statements and/or objectives.

     (3)  Providing evaluation services.

     (4)  Obtaining access to proprietary information.

(c)  If a prime contractor or subcontractor breaches any of the OCCI restrictions, or does not disclose or misrepresents any relevant facts
concerning its conflict of interest, the government may take appropriate action, including terminating the contract, in additional to any
remedies that may be otherwise permitted by the contract or operation of law.

                                                                 (End of clause)

52.212-4      CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS-- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (SEP 2013)

(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The
Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require
repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If
repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or
adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights (1) within
a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) before any substantial change occurs in the condition
of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

(b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a
bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31
U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not
assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.

(c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.

(d) Disputes. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). Failure of the parties to this
contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be
a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor
shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.

adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any
amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided

52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) solicitation provisions if
this is a solicitation; (6) other paragraphs of this clause; (7) the Standard Form 1449; (8) other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9)

(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and
through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting
from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the
Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in
the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this
contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract),
or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-
name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written
notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in
writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification
sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the
Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph
of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an
assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM
database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.

(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through
https://www.acquisition.gov.

(u) Unauthorized Obligations.

(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User
License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to
indemnify the
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation
(31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.

(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in
the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I
agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or
any
Government authorized end user to such clause.

(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically
authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and
its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The
Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have
been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.

contractor, or one of his/her employees, make any inadvertent or any unauthorized disclosure(s) or willfully participate in activities that
result in detrimental harm to the protection and safeguarding of sensitive (GFI) and data, such actions may be considered to be a breach of this

requirements identified by the government until such time the government deems the information/data is no longer sensitive and provides
corresponding written notification to the contractor.

(b) All contractor and support contractor personnel with access to DISA and DOD Information Systems shall complete initial information assurance

252.204-7006   BILLING INSTRUCTIONS (OCT 2005)

When submitting a request for payment, the Contractor shall--

(a) Identify the contract line item(s) on the payment request that reasonably reflect contract work performance; and

(b) Separately identify a payment amount for each contract line item included in the payment request.

(End of clause)




252.204-7011  ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)

(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to
facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit
line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense
Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not
conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing
payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are
requested in this solicitation to
ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.

(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item
structure follow.

252.204-7012  SAFEGUARDING OF UNCLASSIFIED CONTROLLED TECHNICAL INFORMATION (NOV 2013)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Adequate security means protective measures that are commensurate with the consequences and probability of loss, misuse, or unauthorized access
to, or modification of information.

Attribution information means information that identifies the Contractor, whether directly or indirectly, by the grouping of information that
can be traced back to the Contractor (e.g., program description or facility locations).

Compromise means disclosure of information to unauthorized persons, or a violation of the security policy of a system, in which unauthorized
intentional or unintentional disclosure, modification, destruction, or loss of an object, or the copying of information to unauthorized media
may have occurred.

Contractor information system means an information system belonging to, or operated by or for, the Contractor.

Controlled technical information means technical information with military or space application that is subject to controls on the access, use,
reproduction, modification, performance, display, release, disclosure, or dissemination. Controlled technical information is to be marked with
one of the distribution statements B-through-F, in accordance with DoD Instruction 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical Documents. The
term does not include information that is lawfully publicly available without restrictions.

Cyber incident means actions taken through the use of computer networks that result in an actual or potentially adverse effect on an information
system and/or the information residing therein.

Exfiltration means any unauthorized release of data from within an information system. This includes copying the data through covert network
channels or the copying of data to unauthorized media.

Media means physical devices or writing surfaces including, but is not limited to, magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, large-scale
integration memory chips, and printouts onto which information is recorded, stored, or printed within an information system.

Technical information means technical data or computer software, as those terms are defined in the clause at DFARS 252.227-7013, Rights in
Technical Data--Non Commercial Items, regardless of whether or not the

drawings, and associated lists, specifications, standards, process sheets, manuals, technical reports, technical orders, catalog-item
identifications, data sets, studies and analyses and related
information, and computer software executable code and source code.

(b) Safeguarding requirements and procedures for unclassified controlled technical information. The Contractor shall provide adequate security
to safeguard unclassified controlled technical information from compromise. To provide adequate security, the Contractor shall—

(1) Implement information systems security in its project, enterprise, or company-wide unclassified information technology system(s) that may
have unclassified controlled technical information resident on or transiting through them. The information systems security program shall
implement, at a minimum—

(i) The specified National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 security controls identified in the
following table; or

(ii) If a NIST control is not implemented, the Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written explanation of how—

(A) The required security control identified in the following table is not applicable; or

(B) An alternative control or protective measure is used to achieve equivalent protection.

(2) Apply other information systems security requirements when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures,
in addition to those identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this
clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment based on an assessed risk or vulnerability.

Table 1--Minimum Security Controls for Safeguarding

Minimum required security controls for unclassified controlled technical information requiring safeguarding in accordance with paragraph (d) of
this clause. (A description of the security controls is in the NIST SP 800-53, ``Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations'' (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html).)

(d) Cyber incident and compromise reporting.

(1) Reporting requirement. The Contractor shall report as much of the following information as can be obtained to the Department of Defense via
(http://dibnet.dod.mil/) within 72 hours of discovery of any cyber incident, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this clause, that affects

(xiii) Any additional information relevant to the information compromise.

(2) Reportable cyber incidents. Reportable cyber incidents include the following:

(i) A cyber incident involving possible exfiltration, manipulation, or other loss or compromise of any unclassified controlled technical
information resident on or transiting through Contractor's, or its subcontractors', unclassified information systems.

(ii) Any other activities not included in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this clause that allow unauthorized access to the Contractor's unclassified
information system on which unclassified controlled technical information is resident on or transiting.

(3) Other reporting requirements. This reporting in no way abrogates the Contractor's responsibility for additional safeguarding and cyber
incident reporting requirements pertaining to its unclassified information systems under other clauses that may apply to its contract, or as a
result of other U.S. Government legislative and
regulatory requirements that may apply (e.g., as cited in paragraph (c) of this clause).

(4) Contractor actions to support DoD damage assessment. In response to the reported cyber incident, the Contractor shall—

(i) Conduct further review of its unclassified network for evidence of compromise resulting from a cyber incident to include, but is not limited
to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data and users accounts. This includes analyzing information systems that were part of
the compromise, as well as other information systems on
the network that were accessed as a result of the compromise;

(ii) Review the data accessed during the cyber incident to identify specific unclassified controlled technical information associated with DoD
programs, systems or contracts, including military programs, systems and technology; and

(iii) Preserve and protect images of known affected information systems and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days
from the cyber incident to allow DoD to request information or decline interest.

(5) DoD damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor
point of contact identified in the incident report at (d)(1) of this clause provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in
accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this clause. The Contractor shall comply with damage assessment information requests. The requirement to
share files and images exists unless there are legal restrictions that limit a company's ability to share digital media. The Contractor shall
inform the Contracting Officer of the source, nature, and prescription of such limitations and the authority responsible.

(e) Protection of reported information. Except to the extent that such information is lawfully publicly available without restrictions, the
Government will protect information reported or otherwise provided to DoD under this clause in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations,
and policies. The Contractor shall identify and mark
attribution information reported or otherwise provided to the DoD. The Government may use information, including attribution information and
disclose it only to authorized persons for purposes and activities consistent with this clause.

(f) Nothing in this clause limits the Government's ability to conduct law enforcement or counterintelligence activities, or other lawful
activities in the interest of homeland security and national security. The results of the activities described in this clause may be used to
support an investigation and prosecution of any person or
entity, including those attempting to infiltrate or compromise information on a contractor information system in violation of any statute.

(g) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (g), in all subcontracts, including
subcontracts for commercial items.

(End of clause)

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.204-5      Women-Owned Business (OTHER THAN SMALL BUSINESS)  (MAY 1999)

(a) Definition. Women-owned business concern, as used in this provision, means a concern that is at least 51 percent owned by one or more women;
or in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of its stock is owned by one or more women; and whose management and daily
business operations are controlled by one or more women.

(b) Representation. [Complete only if the offeror is a women-owned business concern and has not represented itself as a small business concern
in paragraph (b)(1) of FAR 52.219-1, Small Business Program Representations, of this solicitation.] The offeror represents that it (  ) is a
women-owned business concern.

(End of provision)



52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have      , have not      , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)

   Technical Approach Factor:  The Technical/Management Subfactors will be evaluated and rated either Acceptable or Unacceptable.  The technical
proposal will be evaluated on the offeror's  understanding of requirements and whether the proposal fully meets the requirement of each
paragraph and subparagraph of the PWS.  In order for a proposal to be rated overall Technically Acceptable, each of the following subfactors
must be rated Acceptable.  Failure to be found technically acceptable will result in the offeror being ineligible for award.

      Subfactor 1:  PWS Paragraph 6.6.2 - 3rd Partner Reseller.  In order to be deemed technically acceptable, the offeror must be an authorized
      partner (reseller or distributor) of all 3rd party software being proposed.

      evaluate the soundness of the offerors plan to ensure uninterrupted, continuous access to information technology capacity, the network,
      provide reserve capacity.

   2. Factor 2: Price

      The total proposed price will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404.  The offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated for
      completeness and reasonableness.  The total evaluated will be the sum of all CLINs for the basic and all options to include the Option to
      Extend Services under FAR 52.217-8. Option pricing for the additional 6-month period authorized IAW FAR 52.217-8 shall be identical to
      those in effect immediately prior to exercising any option period in accordance with FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. Ensure you
      include the pricing in your proposal.

      **The offeror shall complete the Pricing Template and include the complete pricing template with their proposal.**


 (B) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration
time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice
of withdrawal is received before award.

The contractor will monitor compliance as required by clause 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons, and report any issues to the
Contracting Officer.

8.  Incentives (Positive and/or Negative):
   The following remedies apply:
        Items 1, 8-9:
         • Any minimum standard not met will be officially documented as a negative record in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting
           System (CPARS).
        Item 2:
         • In the event that VENDOR ceases providing support for any computer program, then IBM shall provide at no additional charge one of two
           possible solutions
               o a replacement IBM computer program (the "Replacement Program") which is Generally Available to Symantec customers and which
                 provides similar, equal or greater substantially equivalent features, functionality and pricing as the Unsupported Computer
                 Program.
               o At DISA’s option, retain the original product, and IBM shall continue to maintain the product and provide documentation for the
                 product (provided continuing support and maintenance is provided) at no additional cost.
       Items 3-7:
         • If resolution is not completed within the performance standard, the invoice will be reduced by the percentage of downtime
           attributable to Severity-1 level error. For example, if downtime is attributable to IBM software issue and a system is down 2 hours,
           the invoice for the month of performance will be reduced by 2%.


   Delivery Incentives


   After the initial delivery of contract equipment and for new equipment that may be added after the original PWS and QASP through normal
   contract modification,  the Contractor will receive an incentive of 1% of the first, full 30-day cost of an individual expedited call order
   when Unisys OS 2200 capacity is delivered prior to the performance standards defined in Attachment J-4 QASP.  This incentive will only apply
   to orders that require expedited delivery as designated by the Government. The 1% incentive will be calculated on the first, full 30-day
   billing of the expedited call order and will be paid only on the first month of billing for the expedited call order.   The designation that
   the call order is eligible for the incentive will be made in the call order.  The measurement to determine if the incentive was achieved will
   be the date of delivery on the receipt of the “Ready-for-Use” email.  Both the date of delivery and the email will need to be submitted prior
   to the next monthly billing cycle for the incentive to be achieved.


   An expedited delivery call order will be identified by the Government to meet specific Unisys OS 2200 capacity orders. Expedited delivery is
   defined as new hardware delivered to satisfy a government-requested expedited call order within 15 business days from call order date to ready-
   for-use.

|Expedited Delivery Date                     |Incentive                                      |Disincentive                                   |
|Ready-for-Use Date (day 1-15)               |Yes                                            |No                                             |
|Ready-for-Use Date (day 16-30)              |No                                             |No                                             |
|Ready-for-Use Date (after day 30)           |No                                             |Yes                                            |


Table 8.1 - Expedited Delivery Table

   In cases where the Government has requested expedited delivery of a call order and then modifies the call order while the Contractor is
   working to meet the expedited delivery request, the Government will reset the expedited delivery timeline.  The effective order date will be
   updated to the date the call order modification is issued.


   Delivery Disincentives:


   The Contractor will be charged a disincentive fee of -1% of the first, full 30-day cost of an individual call order when storage capacity is
   delivered after the performance standards defined in Attachment J-4 QASP.  This fee will only apply to orders that require expedited delivery
   as designated by the Government.  The -1% fee will be calculated on the first, full 30-day billing of the expedited call order and will be
   charged only on the first month of billing for the expedited order.
