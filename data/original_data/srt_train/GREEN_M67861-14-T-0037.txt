         deliverable.
       • Column four is a summary of the vendor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the
         Standard.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.

    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in
      providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also
      an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.

|Section 508 (http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=policies)requires that federal agencies electronic and information technology is    |
|accessible to people with disabilities. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and |
|information technology.                                                                                                                     |

|This GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated|
|with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation |
|respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable Section 508 requirements.          |
|                                                                                                                                            |
|NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard.        |
|Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT          |
|requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for this acquisition |
|have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics          |
|corresponding to any of the listed EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement  |
|applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information.                                                                       |

|The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding |
|to the six technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as     |
|defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables correspond to accessibility information about information  |
|content deliverables and labor hours, respectively.                                                                                         |

declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) ( ___   ) Have, ( ___   ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state
or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or
commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating

amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in

unique item identifier or a DoD recognized unique identification equivalent.

Unique item identifier type means a designator to indicate which method of uniquely identifying a part has been used. The current list of
accepted unique item identifier types is maintained at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/uid/uii_types.html.
