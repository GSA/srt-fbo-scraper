Unless  otherwise  specified,  confidential  and  nonpublic  information  shall  not  be  used  for  purposes  other  than  performance  of  work  under  this  contract  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  the  Contracting  Officer.

SEC information systems designated as sensitive include any information system that  contains information that is subject to the Privacy Act or other regulations, or information  systems that if modified could adversely affect the performance of Federal programs.   The Contractor agrees to include this provision in any subcontract awarded pursuant to this  contract.  Failure to comply with these requirements will constitute cause for termination.  The Contractor shall properly protect all information used, gathered, or developed to carry  out work under the Contract.  The Contractor shall establish and implement appropriate  administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality  of sensitive Government information, data, and/or equipment.

The  documents and information that will be reviewed and produced are confidential in nature  10 SECHQ1-11-R-0014

and shall be protected from unauthorized disclosure.  Work on this project requires that  personnel may have access to Privacy Act information.  Personnel shall adhere to the  Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552a and applicable agency rules and regulations.  H.6 Section 508 Requirements (March 2011)   All electronic and information technology (EIT) procured through this award must meet the  applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194.  36 CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of  the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is viewable at http://www/access board.gov.   The Contractor shall indicate for each line item in the schedule whether each product or  service is compliant or noncompliant with the accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194.   Further, the quote must indicate where full details of compliance can be found (e.g.,  vendor's website or other exact locations).  For contracts issued on or after June 25, 2001, Subsection 508(a)(30) of the Rehabilitation  Act of 1973 requires that: When federal departments or agencies develop, procure,  maintain or use Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) they must ensure that the EIT  allows Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and that  data is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by other Federal  employees; and, that individuals with disabilities who are members of the public seeking  information or services from a Federal Department or agency, have access to and use of  information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public without disabilities.   The Contractor agrees to abide by this law and to ensure that all information created or  used under this contract conforms to the above requirements.  1194.31, Functional Performance Criteria, and 119441, Information Documentation, and  Support  in order to comply with this Section of 508, the Contractor shall submit all soft  copies in a format that will be readable by SEC's standard screen reader.

All web sites and applications have to be compliant with Section 508.    H.7 Organizational Conflicts Of Interest (OCOI)    The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are  no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCOI), as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5.  The Contractor further warrants that it has  disclosed all such relevant information to the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor agrees that if it discovers an actual, apparent, or potential OCOI after award,  the Contractor shall make a full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer.  This  disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes  to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the  actual, apparent or potential conflict.  If the SEC discovers an actual or potential conflict after award, it may terminate this  contract for convenience, in whole or in part.  If the OCOI is discovered prior to award and  the SEC concludes, in its sole discretion, that the OCOI cannot be mitigated, no award will be  made.  If the Contractor did not disclose relevant information or misrepresented relevant  11 SECHQ1-11-R-0014

information to the Contracting Officer, the SEC may terminate the contract for default, debar  the Contractor from SEC contracting, or pursue other remedies as may be permitted by law  or by this contract.   In protecting the SEC's integrity, the Contracting Officer is vested with the broadest possible  discretion as to determining whether an OCOI exists and what remedy is appropriate.  For  this contracting action, all that is required in finding such a conflict is some evidence that  facts exist which could be alleged to constitute an actual or apparent conflict of interest.   Accordingly, it is in each Contractor's best interest to fully inform the Contracting Officer as  early as possible to allow the Contracting Officer the maximum opportunity to find ways to  mitigate or resolve such potential conflicts of interest.    H.8 Contractor Personnel

H.16 Use of Contractor Data and/or Materials   The Contractor acknowledges and agrees to the following: The SEC anticipates using the  data and/or materials to conduct analyses for use in reports, studies, memoranda, and  presentations. The SEC anticipates the following types of situation where analyses based on  underlying data may be made public: by the SEC itself (E.g., SEC rulemaking and/or analysis  done as part of an inspection or enforcement action), by SEC staff where the SEC is directing  or facilitating the publication (e.g., a staff study in response to a Congressional request), by   SEC staff facilitating their own private publication where the Commission has not taken a  position regarding the publication of the analysis(e.g., a research report to be submitted by  the individual staff to an academic conference or journal), and a former employee of the SEC  who has substantially completed the analysis while on staff and is facilitating his/her own  private publication( e.g., a research report to be submitted to an academic conference or  journal). In all of these situations, only "insubstantial amounts" of the licensed data and/or  material would be made public and no raw data would be made public, the authors would  agree to abide by all contractual terms and conditions, and as the owner/licensor of the  data the Contractor would receive attribution and be cited as the data source. "Insubstantial  amounts" means an amount that has no independent commercial value and could not be  used as a substitute for the service or product or any part of it.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria  apply:    (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is  finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not  finally determined if there is a pending administrative or  judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the  liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial  appeal rights have been exhausted.    (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A  taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the  tax liability when full payment was due and required. A  taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection  action is precluded.     (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of  deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek  Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a  delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the  hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax  liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to  contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is  not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court  review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer  has exercised all judicial appeal rights.    (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement  pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely  27 SECHQ1-11-R-0014

payments and is in full compliance with the agreement  terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is  not currently required to make full payment.    (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The  taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action  is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the  offeror and/or any of its principals    (1) ___ are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for  debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal  agency;    (2) ___ have, ___ have not, within a threeyear period preceding this offer,  been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:  Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining,  attempting to obtain, or performing a  Federal, state or local government  contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes  relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft,  forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false  statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving  stolen property; and    (3) ___ are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or  civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these  offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and    (4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a threeyear period preceding this offer,  been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds  $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.    (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria  apply:    (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is  finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not  finally determined if there is a pending administrative or  judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the  liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial  appeal rights have been exhausted.  41 SECHQ1-11-R-0014

  (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A  taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the  tax liability when full payment was due and required. A  taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection  action is precluded.     (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of  deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek  Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a  delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect  to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued  a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to  request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting  the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the  IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the  hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax  liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to  contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is  not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court  review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer  has exercised all judicial appeal rights.    (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement  pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely  payments and is in full compliance with the agreement  terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is  not currently required to make full payment.    (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The  taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action  is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any  end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of  Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor,  unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

versus the requirements of the RFP.  Any such items shall contain sufficient explanation and  justification to permit evaluation.  All benefits to the SEC shall be explained for each item.   Such items may not make a proposal unacceptable unless they fail to provide sufficient  benefits to the SEC, or result in material deviations from the requirements of the contract as  stated in Section C.  The SEC maintains the right to determine if any exceptions, deviations  or conditional assumptions constitute a material deviation.  Therefore, Offerors are  cautioned that any exceptions or deviations to the RFP may render its proposal to be non compliant and ineligible for award.    L.2.4  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL  A.

SECHQ1-11-R-0014

General Experience: Five (5) years technical experience in the management, configuration,  tuning and troubleshooting of Interactive Data.    Minimum Education: Bachelors' Degree and/or equivalent work experience.  All requirements in Section C.5 are necessary but the following three are critical:  has  worked in XBRL specifically, preferably with the XBRL US GAAP Taxonomy; has working  knowledge of XML Schema and XSL 2; and is knowledgeable in C# (for the tasks in the group  "Rendering Engine").  Identify whether each proposed key employee to be assigned to the  award is a current fulltime employee, current parttime employee, contingentemployee,  consultant, or other.  Describe the availability and existing commitments of Key Personnel.   Describe job duties to be performed by proposed Key Personnel under the resulting award  if more than one person is proposed.  Note: An Offeror's overview of proposed Key Personnel  is not considered a Resume and will not satisfy this requirement.  If personnel employed by  other than the Offeror are proposed, the Government will only consider those qualifications if a  firm commitment is demonstrated with the firm by which they are employed or with the  individuals identified.  Commitment letters shall be provided with the proposal.  The Offeror shall provide Past Performance experience that is directly relevant to the  requirements of this solicitation.  The Offeror shall provide at least two (2) but not more  than three (3) Past Performance examples of projects/contracts that required at least 1,000  total personhours for successful performance and that are similar in scope and complexity  to the requirements contained in Section C.  All past performance examples must have been  performed within the past three (3) years.      Provide the following information, if applicable, for each past performance experience:  ˇ Type of client (federal or commercial);  ˇ Total contract dollar amount by year;  ˇ Type of contract (for example, cost reimbursement, fixed price);  ˇ Contract number and date of contract start and expiration;  ˇ Name of contracting organization, telephone, and fax number;  ˇ Contracting Officer and telephone number;  ˇ Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, program manager, or similar  official and telephone number;  ˇ A description of the contract work/implementation and the tasks/subtasks  involved;  ˇ A general timeline from award to full production (system implemented and fully  functioning in the production environment of the agency);  ˇ Problems encountered that slowed implementation and how they were resolved;  ˇ A list of all disputes associated with the contract;  ˇ A list of the contract options that were not exercised and the reason(s) why they  were not exercised; and  ˇ Best practices or lessons learned that will be applied to this implementation.   

FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE   

56

SECHQ1-11-R-0014

In demonstrating Past Performance, the Offeror shall describe the relevance of the work  experience listed above to the requirements contained in Section C, and should provide any  other information that would serve to establish the Offeror's proven technical experience in  fulfilling the requirements contained in the scope of the Section C.    NOTE: Offerors without a record of relevant Past Performance will not be evaluated  favorably or unfavorably on Past Performance.  While the SEC may consider data from other  sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete Past Performance information  rests with the Offeror.      L.2.5 PRICE PROPOSAL   L.2.5.1 The Price Proposal shall be submitted in a separate volume and include:  a. A copy of the company's most recent financial statement or an uptodate Dun &  Bradstreet report validating your company's ability to financially support and fulfill  the requirements.    b. A copy of the company's current CCR registration to confirm that the data is  accurate and up to date.  c. A statement that the company has a current, accurate and complete Offeror  Representations and Certifications registered in the ORCA database.  d. Conflict of Interest Certification  As part of its review, the SEC will consider each  Offeror for actual or potential conflicts of interest between the Offeror and the SEC's  regulatory mission. Should actual or potential conflicts impair the prospect of  successful work by the Offeror, or acceptance of its work under this contract, the  Offeror may not be eligible for award. Certain entities are ineligible for award,  including: (a) any participant in the litigation against the SEC brought by the  Financial Planning Association (FPA v. SEC, Nos. 041242, 051145 (D.C. Cir.)), (b)  PCAOBregistered firms, (c) any investment adviser, brokerdealer or self regulatory organization, and (d) any person employed by the SEC. Employees and  associated persons of such entities also are ineligible. The Offeror shall provide a  signed selfcertification that there are no actual or potential conflicts of interest  (Offeror's format is acceptable).  See Attachment 3 titled "Conflicts of Interest."  e. A completed and signed SF Form 1449 (Page 1) with the contractor's Tax Payer  Identification Number (TIN) and DUNS number printed or typed into block 17.     L 2.5.2 The Price Proposal shall be complete and accurate in all respects and provide all  pricing data to demonstrate Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the work called  for by this RFP.  The Price Proposal does not have a page limit.   END OF SECTION L    SECTION M  EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD   M.1 EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS   a. The SEC reserves the right to award the contract based on initial Proposals received  without discussions or negotiations of such Proposals.  Therefore, it is critically important  that each Proposal be fully responsive to the RFP.  The SEC also reserves the right to  establish a competitive range and to conduct discussions, if later determined to be  necessary, with Offerors making the competitive range.  The SEC reserves the right to limit  57 SECHQ1-11-R-0014

the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition  among the most highly rated proposals.    b. To be accepted and eligible for evaluation, proposals must be prepared in accordance  with this solicitation and must comply with the instructions given in this solicitation  document and must meet all the solicitation requirements.    c. The SEC anticipates awarding a contract to the Offeror whose proposal is the best value to  the SEC, based upon an analysis of the factors below.  Note that proposals will be evaluated  on all factors and no one factor is determinative.  For instance, the SEC may award to an  Offeror that does not offer the lowest price or to an Offeror that is not the highest  technically rated proposal.  The SEC reserves the right to make no award pursuant to this  solicitation.  d. The Technical Approach, Key Personnel and Past Performance factors are approximately  equal in importance and when combined, are more important than Price. As evaluations on  Technical Factors become more equal, Price may become more important.    M.2 TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD    52.21631 Timeandmaterials/laborhour proposal requirements--commercial item  acquisition (FEB 2007)   (a) The Government contemplates award of a LaborHour type of contract resulting from  this solicitation.   (b) The offeror must specify fixed hourly rates in its offer that include wages, overhead,  general and administrative expenses, and profit. The offeror must specify whether the fixed  hourly rate for each labor category applies to labor performed by--   (1) The offeror;   (2) Subcontractors; and/or   (3) Divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the offeror under a common control.   (End of provision)      FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL APPROACH.    The SEC will evaluate the extent to which the proposed solution meets the applicable  functional and technical requirements and demonstrates a high likelihood of successful  implementation with low risk.      FACTOR 2: KEY PERSONNEL   The SEC will evaluate the documentation/resumes for proposed key personal to include an  Interactive Data Specialist to which the qualifications meet or exceed the functional,  educational, and experience requirements and demonstrate an ability to successfully  implement the Offeror's proposed solution.        58 SECHQ1-11-R-0014

FACTOR 3: PAST PERFORMANCE    The SEC will evaluate the Offeror's record of Past Performance on projects of similar scope  and complexity. Specific criteria for evaluating Past Performance include the Offeror's  ability to conform to contract requirements, to adhere to contract schedules, and the  Offeror's commitment to customer satisfaction.  If no record of relevant past performance is  available, this factor will receive a neutral rating.    M.4 PRICE EVALUATION    Price evaluation will be based on comparison of the proposed prices and price  reasonableness. The SEC may compare Offerors' pricing to the following:       1. Pricing from other Government contracts for work of a similar nature.      2. Government Cost Estimates.     3. Pricing from other Offerors for this competition.      4. Market prices.
