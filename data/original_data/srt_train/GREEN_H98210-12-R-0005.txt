H98210-12-R-0005 Page 11 of 42

8.1. The Government reserves the right to perform inspections and surveillance to evaluate the Contractor's compliance to the contract terms and performance of the requirements in the PWS. The Government will make every effort to ensure that the surveillance methods described below are conducted in an objective, fair, and consistent manner. 8.1.1. Periodic Surveillance. This action occurs when the COR or other Government official observes a deficiency. Examples include evidence from accidents, incidents, or delays. Regardless of where in the line-of-duty the COR observes contractual procedures not being followed, he/she has an obligation to document and report the deficiency to the Contracting Officer. 8.1.2. Customer Complaint Surveillance. This action is instituted when the COR receives a complaint from a stakeholder (stakeholder organizations include P&R IM, DPRIS User Agencies, Military Service Repository Owners, and the Defense Information Systems Agency) regarding contractor service. The COR will obtain the complaint in writing and then conduct an investigation to determine its validity. If the complaint is deemed valid, the COR will immediately notify the contracting Officer for action. The COR will notify both the Contract Manager and the complainant of the Government's response to their complaint. 8.2. Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR). In the event of unsatisfactory contractor performance, the COR or CO will issue a CDR that will explain the circumstances and findings concerning the incomplete or unsatisfactory service. The contractor shall acknowledge receipt of the CDR and respond in writing as to how he/she shall correct the unacceptable performance and avoid a recurrence. The Government will review the contractor's corrective action response to determine acceptability and will use any completed CDR as part of an overall evaluation of Contractor performance when determining present or future contractual actions. 9.0 LIST OF EXHIBITS

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency, (2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
