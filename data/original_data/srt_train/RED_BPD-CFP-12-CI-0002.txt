Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center IPP Waiver Form
The Bureau of the Public Debt's Electronic Invoicing And Payment Requirements Clause indicates a preference that all new awards have invoices submitted electronically via the Internet Payment Platform (IPP). If the Contractor does not submit its invoice through IPP, the Contractor shall submit a Waiver Form indicating the reason for the waiver via e-mail to contractadministration@bpd.treas.gov

An individual (includes employees and sole proprietors) determines that the submission of invoices through IPP would impose a hardship due to either a physical or mental disability; a geographic, language, or literacy barrier, or a financial hardship. The political, financial or communications infrastructure of a foreign country does not support access to IPP for submitting invoices electronically. The contractor is located within an area designated by the President or an authorized agency administration as a disaster area. The submission of invoices electronically may pose a threat to national security, the life or physical safety of an individual may be endangered, or a law enforcement action may be compromised. The agency does not expect to receive more than one invoice from the same contractor within a one-year period, i.e., the invoice submission is non-recurring. The contractor's current invoicing system requires submission of ____ files which is not currently supported by IPP. Other ­ Please explain

Contractor Name: Name of Person Submitting Waiver: Email: Contract/Order No.
