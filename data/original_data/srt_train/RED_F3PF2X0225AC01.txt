 Real Time Monitors Inc (RTMI) Software Upgrade at all AETC Bases

12 August 2010



1.0.   DESCRIPTION OF NEED

HQ AETC/A6 and CSS have a requirement to activate existing modules in the Real Time Monitors Inc (RTMI) Switch Expert (SE)Version 6.0.0.5 software application currently supporting the AETC Consolidated Telephone Operators (CTO) 10 locations (Columbus AFB MS, Goodfellow AFB TX, Keesler AFB MS, Lackland AFB TX, Laughlin AFB TX, Luke AFB AZ, Maxwell AFB AL, Randolph AFB TX,  Tyndall AFB FL, and Vance AFB TX).  The RTMI Switch Expert application is the core component used by the AETC CTO (located in Bldg 1623 on Port San Antonio, TX) to remotely monitor the base telephone switch alarms.  This SON is to purchase software, the peripheral hardware for install, and rights to use/license for the following RTMI Switch Expert applications: Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security.  This purchase is critical to ensure telephone operational services for AETC bases are monitored in real time to ensure voice services across the command are not degraded or lost due to host telephone switch hardware or software issues.   



2.0.   BACKGROUND



The AETC CTO utilizes the RTMI Switch Expert client to collect information from the Switch Expert server applications installed at each AETC location to monitor the status of the base telephone switch alarms.  The software will be upgraded on the requested modules in this SON to better provide command wide oversight of all base telephone switches.



3.0.   SCOPE

3.1.   Due to the current configuration Switch Expert Version installed at each AETC base, the contractor must be technically knowledgeable in working the RTMI Switch Expert software application.



3.2.   The contractor will supply all required software to provide the following Core Features:  

 

3.3.   Station Message/Call Detail Recording – Provides real-time tracing of all completed calls.  The real-time tracing is accomplished through a powerful and easy-to-use report wizard that can search for individual station usage, authorization-code usage, bomb threat and harassment calls at a rate of 1.5 million records per minute.  This automated process replaces manual, time-consuming and error prone procedures that could take days to complete. 



3.4.   Operational Measurements (Performance) ─ SE provides numerous reports to supervisors and administrators, along with long-term traffic trending statistics essential for proper provisioning of trunk groups, lines modules and remote switching sites.  



3.5.  Network Element Monitor (NEM) ─ Allows one SE Primary/Parent server to collect the Call Detail Records, Traffic Reports, and System Events from M1/CS 1000/AS 5300 systems with a maximum of 250,000 busy hour attempts per deployed system.



3.6. Command Line Polling (CMD) – Provides a method of polling the secret logs.  This process records all commands entered into the MSL-100 system by maintenance or service order personnel.  This feature is also used to detect hackers attempting to access the MSL-100 system. For CS 2100/MSL-100 systems only.



3.7. Secure Switch Access (Configuration) – Provides authorized clients with remote switch access with integrated VBScripting through the SE server. 



3.8. Report Scheduler (RPT) – Allows the customer to schedule Traffic, System Events, and SMDR/CDR reports and have the output produced in HTML, XLS, PDF and Tabbed Text.  These reports can then be automatically sent via email and/or FTP to their desired destinations.



3.9. Station Message/Call Detail Recording (SMDR/CDR) Real-Time Redirect – This feature allows the SE parent to collect SMDR/CDR records from all children and redirect them to the billing server based on customer definable dialing parameters.  This feature allows SE to record all calls, i.e., Trunk-Line, Line-Line, Trunk-Trunk and Line-Trunk, and redirects only the toll calls to the billing server via FTP, RS232 or TCP client/server network connections.  The redirected records can be the original raw ASCII data produced by the system or can be reformatted into tabbed delimited records with customer definable fields. 



3.9. 1. Enhanced Map (MAP) – The MAP allows centralized clients’ visual alarm indications and point and click access to multiple sites with seamless alarm filtering.



3.9.2. System Event Analyzer (SEA) ─ Allows point and click analysis of thousands of critical, major and minor system events.  SE accomplishes the analysis by allowing the end user to breakdown/analyze like events based on selectable text within the events. 



3.9.3. System Alarm Management (SAM) – Provides a hardware alarm-monitoring and notification process.  The hardware alarm-monitoring is accomplished via an optionally provisioned USB Alarm Interface Unit (AIU).  The AIU provides the customer with 16 incoming and 16 outgoing definable loop contact closure points.  Contact closures may be assigned Critical, Major or Minor alarm severity.
