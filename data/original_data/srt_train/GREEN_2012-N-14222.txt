B.5  HHSAR 352.232-72 Limitation of Government’s obligation (June 2010)

 (a) Contract line items * through * are incrementally funded. For these items, the sum of $ * of the total price is the amount currently obligated, available for payment, and allotted to this contract. A projected allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (i) of this clause. However, the Government may at any time allot additional funds for the performance of these contract line items.

(b) For items identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government’s convenience, approximates, but does not exceed, the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not required to continue work on those items beyond that point. The Government shall not be required in any event to pay the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those items notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the clause entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.” As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of such termination of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) above includes costs, profit, and estimated/negotiated termination settlement costs for those item(s).

(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (i) of this clause, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least 30 days prior to the date when, in the Contractor’s best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable items. The Contractor notification shall provide: (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached; and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (i) of this clause, or up to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification shall also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the items funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (i) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If, after such notification, additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor’s notification, or by a mutually agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”

(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line items identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and mutually agreed date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.

(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds by the dates indicated below in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line items identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are subsequently allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the items, or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact under the clause entitled “Disputes.”

(f) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled “Default.” This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.

(g) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for the Convenience of the Government.” Furthermore, in the event of a termination for convenience of the contract, for line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government’s liability is limited to the total amount allotted and obligated for those line item(s) as of the date of such termination.

(h) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is prohibited under .

(i) The following represents the mutually-agreed schedule* by which the Government will allot funds to this contract. [The illustrated schedule may be revised as necessary to suit the specific circumstances of the contract.]

 

* To be inserted after negotiation.

(End of clause)



Alternate I (June 2010)

If only one contract line item will be incrementally funded, substitute the following paragraph (a) for paragraph (a) of the basic clause:

(a) Contract line item ___*___ is incrementally funded. For this item, the sum of $ * of the total price is currently available for payment and allotted to this contract. A projected allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (i) of this clause. However, the Government may at any time allot additional funds for the performance of this contract line item.

* To be inserted after negotiation.

C.14 Evaluation of Contractor Performance (Service) (Jan 2000) 

(a) Purpose



In accordance with FAR 42.1502, the Contractor's performance will be periodically evaluated by the Government, in order to provide current information for source selection purposes.  These evaluations will therefore be marked “Source Selection Information.”



(b)  Performance Evaluation Period



The Contractor's performance will be evaluated at least annually. 



(c)  Evaluators



The performance evaluation will be completed jointly by the Project officer and the Contracting officer.



(d)  Performance Evaluation Factors



The contractor's performance will be evaluated in accordance with the attachment listed in Section J titled Performance Evaluation Report.



(e)  Contractor Review



A copy of the evaluation will be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluation.  The contractor shall submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information to the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days after receipt of the evaluation.



(f)  Resolving Disagreements between the Government and the Contractor



Disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation will be reviewed at a level above the Contracting Officer.  The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency.  Copies of the evaluation, contractor's response, and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the evaluation.



(g)  Release of Contractor Performance Evaluation Information



The completed evaluation will not be released to other than Government personnel and the contractor whose performance is being evaluated.  Disclosure of such information could cause harm both to the commercial interest of the Government and to the competitive position of the contractor being evaluated as well as impede the efficiency of Government operations.



(h) Source Selection Information



Departments and agencies may share past performance information with other Government departments and agencies when requested to support future award decisions.  The information may be provided through interview and/or by sending the evaluation and comment document to the requesting source selection official.



(i)  Retention Period



The agency will retain past performance information for a maximum period of three years after completion of contract performance for the purpose of providing source selection information for future contract awards.

(End of Clause)


C.16 Contracting Officer (Jul 1999) 

(a) The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds. No person other than the Contracting Officer can make any changes to the terms, conditions, general provisions, or other stipulations of this contract.



(b)  No information, other than that which may be contained in an authorized modification to this contract, duly issued by the Contracting Officer, which may be received from any person employed by the United States Government, or otherwise, shall be considered grounds for deviation from any stipulation of this contract.                              (End of Clause)


C.17   52.232-22  Limitation of Funds (Apr 1984)



 (a) The parties estimate that performance of this contract will not cost the Government more than (1) the estimated cost specified in the Schedule or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the Government’s share of the estimated cost specified in the Schedule. The Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within the estimated cost, which, if this is a cost-sharing contract, includes both the Government’s and the Contractor’s share of the cost. 

(b) The Schedule specifies the amount presently available for payment by the Government and allotted to this contract, the items covered, the Government’s share of the cost if this is a cost-sharing contract, and the period of performance it is estimated the allotted amount will cover. The parties contemplate that the Government will allot additional funds incrementally to the contract up to the full estimated cost to the Government specified in the Schedule, exclusive of any fee. The Contractor agrees to perform, or have performed, work on the contract up to the point at which the total amount paid and payable by the Government under the contract approximates but does not exceed the total amount actually allotted by the Government to the contract. 

(c) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing whenever it has reason to believe that the costs it expects to incur under this contract in the next 60 days, when added to all costs previously incurred, will exceed 75 percent of (1) the total amount so far allotted to the contract by the Government or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the amount then allotted to the contract by the Government plus the Contractor’s corresponding share. The notice shall state the estimated amount of additional funds required to continue performance for the period specified in the Schedule. 

(d) Sixty days before the end of the period specified in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing of the estimated amount of additional funds, if any, required to continue timely performance under the contract or for any further period specified in the Schedule or otherwise agreed upon, and when the funds will be required. 

(e) If, after notification, additional funds are not allotted by the end of the period specified in the Schedule or another agreed-upon date, upon the Contractor’s written request the Contracting Officer will terminate this contract on that date in accordance with the provisions of the Termination clause of this contract. If the Contractor estimates that the funds available will allow it to continue to discharge its obligations beyond that date, it may specify a later date in its request, and the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract on that later date. 

(f) Except as required by other provisions of this contract, specifically citing and stated to be an exception to this clause— 

(1) The Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred in excess of the total amount allotted by the Government to this contract; and 

(2) The Contractor is not obligated to continue performance under this contract (including actions under the Termination clause of this contract) or otherwise incur costs in excess of— 

(i) The amount then allotted to the contract by the Government or; 

(ii) If this is a cost-sharing contract, the amount then allotted by the Government to the contract plus the Contractor’s corresponding share, until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the amount allotted by the Government has been increased and specifies an increased amount, which shall then constitute the total amount allotted by the Government to this contract. 

(g) The estimated cost shall be increased to the extent that (1) the amount allotted by the Government or, (2) if this is a cost-sharing contract, the amount then allotted by the Government to the contract plus the Contractor’s corresponding share, exceeds the estimated cost specified in the Schedule. If this is a cost-sharing contract, the increase shall be allocated in accordance with the formula specified in the Schedule. 

(h) No notice, communication, or representation in any form other than that specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this clause, or from any person other than the Contracting Officer, shall affect the amount allotted by the Government to this contract. In the absence of the specified notice, the Government is not obligated to reimburse the Contractor for any costs in excess of the total amount allotted by the Government to this contract, whether incurred during the course of the contract or as a result of termination. 

(i) When and to the extent that the amount allotted by the Government to the contract is increased, any costs the Contractor incurs before the increase that are in excess of— 

(1) The amount previously allotted by the Government or; 

(2) If this is a cost-sharing contract, the amount previously allotted by the Government to the contract plus the Contractor’s corresponding share, shall be allowable to the same extent as if incurred afterward, unless the Contracting Officer issues a termination or other notice and directs that the increase is solely to cover termination or other specified expenses. 

(j) Change orders shall not be considered an authorization to exceed the amount allotted by the Government specified in the Schedule, unless they contain a statement increasing the amount allotted. 

(k) Nothing in this clause shall affect the right of the Government to terminate this contract. If this contract is terminated, the Government and the Contractor shall negotiate an equitable distribution of all property produced or purchased under the contract, based upon the share of costs incurred by each. 

(l) If the Government does not allot sufficient funds to allow completion of the work, the Contractor is entitled to a percentage of the fee specified in the Schedule equalling the percentage of completion of the work contemplated by this contract.

SECTION D    CONTRACT DOCUMENS, EXHIBITS OR ATTACHMENTS





D.1  Performance Work Statement (PWS)





Background

  

Public Health Library and Information Center (PHLIC) purchases and subscribes to print and electronic resources such as journals in print and electronic formats, access to various databases, and print and electronic books.  We have traditionally procured our resources through several methods, including contracts, purchase orders, and credit card purchases.  Historically, print content has been acquired through a multi-year print journal contract.  However, electronic content has been paid separately either through a purchase order, multi-year contract or through the government credit card.  This has created more work for all involved, including PHLIC staff, PHLIC’s administrative officer, and PGO staff.





Scope and Requirements



The contractor will process new and renewal orders on CDC’s behalf for selected library resources in any of these formats: print, print plus online, or online only formats.  Print formats will be ordered when that is the only format available, or when the publisher requires subscriptions be bundled – print and online.  In addition, contractor must be able to handle delivery of print journals to multiple ship-to addresses (See Attachment 1 in Section D).  



CDC has long-standing relationships with major publishers in the medical sciences and will sometimes request a quote for materials directly from a publisher.  In turn the publisher will provide a proforma invoice (quote).  If CDC accepts the proforma invoice, the contractor will be required to place order and pay the invoices at any time during the year within 2 weeks of receipt, and invoice CDC within one week of payment to publisher. 



Whenever possible, the contractor will assure continued access to previously subscribed content from publishers.  While most large publishers do offer this to their customers, every effort must be made to ensure that access to content from subscriptions placed in previous years is honored.  Resources must be accessible through a web-based interface and integrate with current CDC systems and comply with security regulations.  Accessibility should not require any client-installed software. Public Health Library and Information Center (PHLIC) will provide a list of resources which will include print and electronic journal titles, electronic books, and databases.  For estimating purposes see proposed list (Part VII-Attachments);  materials are not limited to this list.  The contractor must provide access to a web-based serials management system with accurate, up to date, and complete information accessible to its customers 24/7.  It should contain complete bibliographic data.  If a title is not in their database, it should be added within 48 hours.  It must contain the capability to run sortable reports (Excel spreadsheets).  Most subscriptions to journals regardless of format run on the calendar year, from January to December.  The majority of purchases (85%) occur in the first quarter of the fiscal year.  In addition, total purchases can vary from year to year by 12-15%.


The objective is to place all orders and renewals for journals, databases and electronic books in a variety of formats through one contractor, streamlining the procurement process.

 	 	 	 	 	 

Deliverables

  

Most subscriptions to journals regardless of format run on the calendar year, from January to December. Journal orders must be placed with publishers within 30 days after award of contract.  Deliverables include print issues which will be supplied depending on the frequency of each journal title, and provide electronic access to all titles and databases as specified.  The majority of purchases (85%) occur in the first quarter of the fiscal year. For estimating purposes see proposed list of Journals, Databases and E-Books listed in Attachment 2 in Section D; materials are not limited to this list.



The contractor must be able to handle separate ship-to-addresses (See Attachment 1), sending print issues to the respective library location.  Electronic access to journals and books should be activated upon the placing of orders.



The contractor must provide access to a web-based serials management system with accurate, up-to-date, and complete information available 24/7.  This system must be capable of providing sortable reports (as an Excel spreadsheet) to several access points such as: title, publisher, ISSN, country of publication, publication frequency, subscription period, available formats, price, bill-to address, ship-to address for print, account number charged, customer subscriber number (assigned by publisher), subscription status (irregular, discontinued, slow), and restrictions for institutional subscribers clearly stated.



CDC must have the ability to generate claims for missing print issues online through electronic data interchange (EDI). Contractor will manage the claim process.  This includes receiving files for the claims and disbursing to publishers.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to ensure replacement issues are received or a credit is issued to CDC.  



CDC will sometimes request a quote for materials directly from a publisher.  In turn the publisher will provide a proforma invoice (quote).  If CDC accepts the proforma invoice, the contractor will be required to place order and pay the invoices at any time during the year within 2 weeks of receipt, and invoice CDC within one week of payment to publisher. Funds to cover such orders will be added to the contract unilaterally. 



The contractor must also provide a customer representative who has the authority to resolve problems arising in the CDC account.  The customer representative must be available Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. EST/EDT.  He/she must be available for site visits, as well as by telephone or e-mail to resolve problems and provide updates.



Other 



 Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility (Section 508)



Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Provisions (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit:



(1) Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and



(2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.



Accordingly, any contractor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility provisions. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access- board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm.



The Section 508 standards applicable to this solicitation are 



36CFR 1194.21

36 CFR 1194.22

36 CFR 1194.31

36 CFR 1194. 41



In order to facilitate the Government’s evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows contractors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://508.hhs.gov.



Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products and/or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a contractor claims its products and/or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government – i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products and/or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the contractor’s Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.





Delivery or Performance-period Requirements 



Period of performance will be 12 months with four 12 month options.  The delivery will vary depending on the type of resource being ordered.  Journals (print as well as electronic) run on the calendar year (January 1 – December 31) but databases and electronic books will run for 12 months from the date of order.  The majority of purchases (85%) occur in the first quarter of the fiscal year.  PHLIC has access to resources which run from June 1 to May 31.  Electronic books generally are available as subscriptions or a one-time purchase with an annual hosting fee.  If possible and available for purchase, this will be the preferred method of acquisition.

E.4  Proposal Instructions



Offerors are advised that in the proposal evaluation process, technical merit and other non-cost factors are of more importance than cost or price.  In evaluating proposals for award, the Government will perform a “best value” analysis, making award to the offeror whose integrated proposal represents the best overall value to the Government.

(End of Provision)



E.4.3  Incurring Costs (May 1998)

This solicitation does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with the proposed acquisition.



(End of Provision)



E.4.4 Additional Business Proposal Instructions  

The business proposal shall be comprised of the following elements:



(a)  Completed Solicitation Section B to establish total contract not to exceed value.



(b)  Subcontracting Plan (Large Businesses only). 



(c)  An Excel Spreadsheet to establish total evaluated price.



Each Large Business offeror shall provide a Small Business Subcontracting Plan that contains all the elements required by FAR 52.219-9, or demonstrate that no subcontracting opportunities exist...  The Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not a requirement for evaluation in source selection, but rather a requirement for award to a large business and will be incorporated into any resultant contract.  The percentage goals negotiated for as part of any successful offeror's subcontracting plan will apply for the life of the contract. 



(d)  Other Administrative Data



(1) The offeror must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFP.  In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 90 days from the date of receipt by the Government.

(End of Clause)





E.4.5 Past Performance Proposal Instructions

A. Offerors shall submit the following information as part of their business proposal for both the Offeror and proposed major subcontractors:



B. The Offeror shall provide a list of the last three (3) contracts completed during the past three years and the last (3) contracts awarded currently in progress that are similar in nature to the solicitation work scope. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts as required above for all key personnel:



a. Name of Contracting Organization



b. Contract Number



c. Total Contract Value



d. Description of Requirement



e. Contract Officer's name and telephone number



f. Program Manager's name and telephone number



C. Each Offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which the Offerors relative rankings will be compared to assure the best value to the Government. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the acquisition under consideration. The government is not required to contact all references provided by the Offeror, and references other than those identified by the Offeror may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will be considered in the evaluation of the Offeror’s past performance.



D. An evaluation of Offeror's past performance information will be conducted subsequent to the technical evaluation.  However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any Offeror whose proposal would not be selected for award based on the results of the evaluation of factors other than past performance.



E. The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the Offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.



The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each Offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that Offeror's record of past performance. 



The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an Offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information.  



When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the Offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the Offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the Offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the Offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.



The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the Offeror's performance.



The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the Offeror.



E.5 Proposal Evaluation 



E.5.1 Technical EvaluationCriteria



The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following shall be used to evaluate offers: 



Criteria				     			Points

Technical Approach and Understanding of the Requirement				   45

Similar Experience							   35

Corporate Capability					                    20

		  		Total Points        100



These criteria will be evaluated according to the extent that they reflect clear understanding of the requirements of this contract and on the soundness, practicality, and feasibility of the contractor’s technical approach for providing the services required.









E.5.2 Technical Strength More Important than Cost/Price (Jan 2000)

Offerors are advised that in proposal evaluation, paramount consideration shall be given to technical proposals rather than to cost or price unless, as a result of technical evaluations, proposals are judged to be essentially equal, in which case cost or price shall become the determining factor. 



Discussions, if held, will be conducted only with those offerors determined to be within the competitive range. 



Award shall be made to that responsible offeror submitting the proposal (Technical and Business) determined to be the most advantageous and the best value to the Government as evaluated under the criteria described in this Solicitation.



(End of Clause)



E.5.3 Past Performance Evaluation

Past performance information will be evaluated in the following manner:



		(a)  Each offeror shall be evaluated on its past performance under current and prior contracts.  By past performance, the Government means the offeror's record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the contractor's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules and terms, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's businesslike concern for the interest of the customer and the degree of quality of deliverables and performance. 



		(b)  Past performance will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall quality of the offeror's past performance will be highly influential in determining the relative merits of the offeror's proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered the most advantageous/best value to the Government.



		(c)  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance for similar services relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.



		(d)  The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror's past performance based on collaborated past performance evaluations included in the offerors proposal and/or other information obtained from references provided by the offeror, as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government.  The Government may or may not survey all contracts listed by the offeror, and reserves the right to perform customer surveys only for those contracts which are deemed by the Government to be most relevant to this procurement. 

   

		(e)  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance. 



	 (f)  The assessment of the offerors past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and the other competitors. Thus, an offeror with an exceptional record of relevant past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable and/or less relevant, even though both may have acceptable technical and business proposals.  



	 (g)  An offeror without a record of past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.



	 (h)  Information provided by Offerors, as requested under Section L herein, relating to problems encountered on the identified contracts and the Offeror’s corrective actions will be considered when unfavorable reports of past performance are received.  If award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity clarify certain aspects of past performance information (e.g. relevance of an offeror’s past performance information and averse past performance which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond).   Communications may be held with Offerors to obtain additional information regarding adverse past performance when required for making a competitive range determination.   If discussions are held, offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.   



	 (i)  Past performance will be evaluated for only those offerors remaining in the competitive range after the initial technical evaluation.



	 (j)  Evaluation of past performance information will be reflected in terms of the following degrees of performance assessment:



	   Excellent:  A significant majority of the sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror’s performance was superior and that they would unhesitatingly do business with the offeror again.  Complaints are negligible or unfounded.  The offeror has no record of criminal conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old and the offeror has demonstrated by more recent performance that corrective action has made the likelihood of such conduct in the future highly improbably.  No doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government’s requirements as stated in the RFP. 



	   Good:  Most sources of information state that the offeror’s performance was good, better than average, etc., and that they would willingly do business with the offeror again.  Complaints, though perhaps well-founded, are few and relatively minor.  The offeror has no record of criminal conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old and the offeror has demonstrated by more recent performance that corrective action has made the likelihood of such conduct in the future highly improbable.  Little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government’s requirements as stated in the RFP.



	   Neutral:  Either no past performance history exists for the corporation, predecessor companies, key personnel, or major/critical subcontractors, or the offeror’s record of past performance was neither predominantly favorable nor unfavorable.  In the latter case, sources of information are roughly divided over the quality of the offeror’s performance.  While some state that they would do business with the offeror again, others are doubtful or would not.  Complaints are balanced by reports of good work.  The offeror has no record of criminal conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old.



	   Marginal:  Many sources of information made unfavorable reports about the offeror’s performance and either express serious doubts about doing business with the offeror again or state that they would refuse to do so.  However, there are some favorable reports, and some sources of information indicate that they would do business with the offeror again.  There are many significant, serious, and well-founded complaints, but there are some reports of very good performance.  The offeror may have been indicted, pled guilty, or may have been found guilty in matters of criminal conduct, but the issues are either unresolved, relatively minor, or do not reflect a company-wide or managerial pattern of wrongdoing.  The offeror may have lost civil suits for fraud or negligence, but there is no company-wide or managerial pattern of fraudulent, negligent, or criminal conduct.  Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government’s requirements as stated in the RFP.



	   Poor:  A significant majority of sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror’s performance was entirely unsatisfactory and that they would not do business with the offeror again under any circumstances.  Customer complaints are substantial or numerous and are well-founded.  Or, although not debarred or suspended, the offeror is under indictment or has been convicted of criminal conduct, or has been found civilly liable for fraud or negligence.  The offeror either has presented no persuasive evidence of having taken appropriate corrective action that will guard against such conduct in the foreseeable future, or it appears unlikely that the corrective action will be effective.  Serious doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government requirements as stated in the RFP.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 

(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 

(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at (b).] 

(1) Listed end products.

(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] 

[  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. 

[  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. 

(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly— 

(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or 

(2) o Outside the United States. 

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] 

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR (c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that— 

(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; 

(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR (c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and 

(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. 

[  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR (d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that— 

(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; 

(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR (d)(2)(iii)); 

(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and 

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 

(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 

(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 

(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (, ). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) 

(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of , reporting requirements of , and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 

(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror’s relationship with the Government (). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR , the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror’s TIN.
