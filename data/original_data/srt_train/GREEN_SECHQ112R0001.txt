NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (CONTRACTOR) A. Intending to be legally bound, _________________________ (the "Contractor") hereby accepts the obligations contained in this Agreement in consideration of being granted conditional access to SEC confidential and non-public information. For purposes of this Agreement, "confidential or non-public information," is defined as information generated by or in the possession of the SEC that is commercially valuable, trade secret, market sensitive, proprietary, related to an SEC enforcement or examination matter, subject to privilege, protected by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a), or otherwise deemed confidential or non-public by an SEC division director or office head, and is not otherwise available to the public. This definition applies to confidential or non-public information in any form, including documents, electronic mail, computer files, conversations, and audio or video recordings. For purposes of this Agreement, examples of confidential or non-public information include corporate financial data provided to the SEC that has not been made public; SEC planned or contemplated courses of action regarding SEC examinations, investigations, and enforcement actions; and SEC personnel information covered by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. B. The Contractor acknowledges that any conditional access to SEC confidential and non-public information is granted to Contractor for the sole purpose of performing its obligations under SEC Contract __SECHQ1-09-C-0114_____ (the "underlying Contract"). This Agreement does not grant Contractor access to information or materials that the SEC determines in its sole discretion is inappropriate for disclosure to Contractor. C. Contractor acknowledges that the SEC Regulation Concerning Conduct of Members and Employees and Former Members and Employees of the Commission expressly prohibits the improper use and unauthorized disclosure of confidential or non-public information or documents. See 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(1) & (b)(2) available at http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/textidx?c=ecfr&rgn=div5&view=text&node=17:2.0.1.1.1&idno=17#17:2.0.1.1.1.13.3.3. Contractor, for itself and its employees, agents, and subcontractors, agrees to be bound by the prohibitions of § 200.735-3(b)(1) & (b)(2) and the terms set forth herein. Contractor, for itself and its employees, agents, and subcontractors, agrees not to disclose to any unauthorized person any confidential or non-public documents or information to which Contractor or its employees, agents, or subcontractors have access in the performance of duties under the underlying Contract. D. In accordance with the SEC Regulation at 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(1), the Contractor, for itself and its employees, agents, and subcontractors, agrees not to engage, directly or indirectly, in any personal business transaction or private arrangement for personal profit the opportunity for which arises because of performance under the Contract, or that is based upon confidential or non-public information which the Contractor and its employees, agents, and subcontractors gain in the course of performance under the Contract. E. In accordance with the SEC Regulation at 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(2)(i), the Contractor, for itself and its employees, agents, and subcontractors, agrees not to disclose to any unauthorized person or release in advance of authorization for its release, any confidential or non-public document or information: (1) protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. §§ 552, 552a, and 552b or any rules or regulations of the SEC; or (2) in circumstances where the SEC has determined to accord such information confidential treatment, unless the SEC authorizes the disclosure of such information as provided for under 17 C.F.R. § 200.7353(b)(2)(ii). Confidential and non-public information shall be shared with authorized persons only on a needto-know basis. F. For purposes of this Agreement, an "unauthorized person" is anyone other than (1) an officer or employee of the SEC, (2) an employee of the Contractor who has executed a non-disclosure agreement with the SEC under the Contract, (3) an employee of a subcontractor of the Contractor who has executed a non-

disclosure agreement with the SEC under the Contract, and whose employer advises Contractor as such, or (4) any individual that the Contracting Officer expressly designates as a person authorized to receive the confidential or non-public information at issue.

                                             Section 1194.31 Functional Performance Criteria - Detail

The performance requirements of this section are intended for overall product evaluation and for technologies or components for which there is
no specific requirement under the technical standards in Subpart B. These criteria are designed to ensure that the individual accessible
components work together to create an accessible product. They cover operation, including input and control functions, operation of mechanical
mechanisms, and access to visual and audible information. These provisions are structured to allow people with sensory or physical disabilities
to locate, identify, and operate input, control and mechanical functions and to access the information provided, including text, static or
dynamic images, icons, labels, sounds or incidental operating cues.

SECTION C ­ DESCRIPTION / SPECIFICATIONS / STATEMENT OF WORK C.1. Scope The Contractor shall provide the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation and Division of Trading and Markets (collectively "the Divisions") with an equity and equity option market data collection and analysis solution that combines access to data services, applications, and related databases and provides SEC staff with the same speed, ease, and reliability of data collection and analysis that is available to sophisticated market participants. The solution shall allow SEC staff to collect, store, aggregate, monitor, query, manipulate, and analyze equity and equity option data, including trades, quotes, and orders, as currently disseminated by the various national securities exchanges, over-the-counter markets, and alternative trading systems (collectively "the venues"). The solution shall be capable of scaling to include non-equity data and additional equity data that become available from these or similar venues. The solution's data sources shall include (a) consolidated tapes (i.e., data reported through a securities information processor (SIP)) and (b) proprietary data products sold by the exchanges. The solution shall provide for data cleansing to correct faulty observations, data gaps, and improper sequencing so that the data can be directly analyzed using standard econometric and statistical methods. The solution shall provide a means for the SEC to augment exchange-feed data in the solution's database with other market data that may only be available to the SEC such as trade data from the SECs "electronic blue sheets" system. The solution may provide a generic method for including such data or specific methods configured to specific types of data. The solution shall comprise commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or government off-the-shelf (GOTS) software. The solution may be externally hosted and maintained by the Contractor or internally hosted at the SEC. The Contractor shall provide implementation services for the solution, including business process analysis, installation and configuration, compliance documentation support, user training, testing support and remediation, and help desk support during deployment. The Contractor shall provide regular software maintenance and ongoing technical support for the solution. C.1.1 Background The SEC Division of Trading and Markets provides day-to-day oversight of the major securities market participants: the securities exchanges; securities firms; self-regulatory organizations (SROs) including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), clearing agencies that help facilitate trade settlement; transfer agents (parties that maintain records of securities owners); securities information processors (SIPs); and credit rating agencies. Inherent in its oversight responsibility is market surveillance and analysis. The SEC Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation provide interdisciplinary research and analysis to help the SEC better understand complex matters. The Division helps identify, analyze, and respond to risks and trends, including those associated with new financial products,
Page 3 of 49 SECHQ112R0001

strategies, and technologies. It also provides economic and quantitative research to support SEC rulemaking and other decision-making. Currently, the Divisions primarily use daily trade and quote data for monitoring and analyzing intraday equity transactions. This data is limited to top-of-book orders at each trading venue, and provides a view of the markets as seen from the consolidated tape. The Divisions would like to expand their capabilities by extending data collection to real-time feeds in ways that allow a fuller analysis of trading. The solution may be used by up to 100 SEC staff members who have knowledge of market data and a moderate degree of technical expertise. See the SEC Technical Reference Model (TRM, section C.2.4.33) for information about the SEC technical environment.

C.3.1.1 OIT Policies and Procedures. The Contractor shall conform to SEC administrative regulations, policies and procedures. See sections C.2.2 through C.2.4. The Contractor shall work with SEC internal organizations as needed to ensure that policies, procedures, configuration control, and product life-cycle requirements are fulfilled to the satisfaction of the SEC Office of Information Technology (OIT). C.3.1.2 Section 508 Accessibility. The Contractor's products and services shall comply with all applicable provisions of the standards issued by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) (http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/) to ensure the accessible use of Federal electronic and information technology. See also C.2.1.3 and C.2.4.1 through C.2.4.6. C.3.1.3 Information Security for Hosted Systems (if applicable) The SEC is required to provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source. Section 3544(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) describes Federal agency security responsibilities as including "information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency." This includes services that are either fully or partially provided; including other agency hosted, outsourced, and cloud computing solutions. The security requirements identified in this section are specific to contractor-owned and operated systems on behalf of SEC, or the Federal Government when SEC is the managing agency. Federal agencies are responsible for ensuring that information technology acquisitions comply with the information technology security requirements in FISMA, OMB's implementing policies including Appendix III of OMB Circular A-130, and guidance and standards from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) including NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 3, "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems," hereinafter referred to as NIST 800-53. Each of the subsections below highlights a key element of SEC's IT security objectives for contractor acquisition efforts. C.3.1.3.1 Compliance Requirements The Contractor shall conform to all SEC and Federal IT Security standards, policies, and reporting requirements.

Page 35 of 49

SECHQ112R0001

services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in FAR 39.2.The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm. All EIT products must comply with the following standards. Descriptions of the standards are viewable at the link Section 508 Standards. ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 21-Software applications and operating systems ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 22-Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 23-Telecommunication Products ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 24-Video and Multimedia Products ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 25-Self contained, closed products ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 26-Desktop and Portable Computers ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 31-Functional Performance Criteria 36 CFR 1194 Section 41-Information, documentation, and support Offerors that fail to demonstrate compliance with the above standards, or provide equivalent salient characteristics, may be eliminated from further consideration for award. The Contractor shall indicate for each line item in the schedule whether each product or service is compliant or non-compliant with the accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194 using a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT). Further, the quote must indicate where full details of compliance can be found (e.g., vendor's website or other exact location). The offeror further represents that all EIT products and services that are less than fully compliant have been reviewed and plans to correct are in place. Respondents to this solicitation must provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products and/or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products and/or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 standards, and it is later determined by the Government, i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products and/or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense. (End of Provision) H.6.2 SEC Clause 6012.04 -- Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility (Mar 2011) Each Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) product or service furnished under this contract shall comply with the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards (36 CFR 1194 ).

The Contractor shall, without charge to the Government, repair or replace the noncompliant products or services within the period of time to be specified by the Government in

Page 36 of 49

SECHQ112R0001

writing. If such repair or replacement is not completed within the time specified, the Government shall have the following recourses: The right to Termination of the contract, delivery or task order, purchase or line item without termination liabilities pursuant to the contract termination clauses; or In the case of custom Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) being developed for the Government, the Government shall have the right to have any necessary changes made or repairs performed by itself or by another firm and the contractor shall reimburse the Government for any expenses incurred thereby. For every EIT product or service accepted under this contract by the Government that does not comply with 36 CFR 1194, the contractor shall, at the discretion of the Government, make every effort to replace or upgrade it with a compliant equivalent product or service, if commercially available and cost neutral, on either the planned refresh cycle of the product or service, or on the contract renewal date, whichever shall occur first. In the event of a modification(s) to this contract/order, which adds new EIT products and services or revises the type of, or specifications for, products and services the Contractor is to provide, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor provide an update of information provided in the solicitation to identify EIT compliance. Under any maintenance agreement, Contractor agrees to maintain compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for all EIT. In order to comply with 36 CFR 1194 Section 41, the Contractor shall submit all soft copies (e.g., user manuals, product documentation, etc.) in a format that will be readable using assistive technology, (e.g., screen reader). All imbedded charts, graphs, pictures, etc., must be accessible and understandable using a screen reader. (End of Clause) H.7 Conflicts of Interest
1.

General. Subpart 9.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation 48 C.F.R. 9.5, prescribes responsibilities, general rules, and procedures for identifying, evaluating, and resolving organization conflicts of interest. Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to avoid, neutralize, or otherwise mitigate organizational conflicts of interest which might exist related to a Contractor's performance of work required by this contract.

Definition. For purposes of this clause, the term "Contractor" means: The Contractor; any of the Contractor's parents, affiliates or other entities in which the Contractor or such parents or affiliates have a financial interest; successors in interest to the Contractor or any of its parents or affiliates; proposed consultants or subcontractors at any tier; and employees thereof. Restrictions. The Contractor agrees: a. To remain ineligible to participate in any capacity (including participating as a prime contractor, subcontractor, or as the representative of another party) in contracts, subcontracts, or proposals (whether solicited or unsolicited) that directly relate to the Contractor's performance of work under this Contract. b. Prior to beginning work on a task order, to execute such Confidentiality Agreements, Statements of Non-Disclosure or other documents which the Contracting Officer may, in his/her sole discretion, require in order to protect the proprietary nature or confidentiality of information provided by the Government or otherwise received by the Contractor in connection with its work under this Contract. c. Prior to the acceptance of a task order request, to immediately notify the Contracting Officer of any potential conflict of interest which would prevent or limit the Contractor's ability too perform the work requested. d. To immediately notify the Contracting Officer of any conflict of interest discovered during Contractor's performance of work pursuant to a Government issued task order; provided that the Contracting Officer shall have the right to impose such restrictions as he/she deems appropriate on Contractor's performance based on the existence of such a conflict or, if the Contracting Officer determines that such restrictions would not adequately address the conflict of interest at issue, to terminate the Contractor's performance of work under the task order at no cost to the Government. e. As otherwise provided in this Contract, that if the Contractor declines to accept a task order request and subsequently participates (either directly or as a representative of another party) in a Government contracting action that was the subject of the task order request, then the fee which the Contractor would have been entitled to receive for such task order work or the fee actually paid by the Government for the task order's performance by another contractor, whichever is greater, shall be applied toward the Contractor's minimum ordering guarantee. f. That in the event that Contractor knowingly withholds the existence of a conflict of interest from the Government, that the Contracting Officer may terminate this Contract at no cost to the Government and any minimum guarantee(s) otherwise applicable to the Contractor will be forfeited; provided, that the foregoing shall be in addition to all other remedies and causes of action which the Government may

4.

Page 38 of 49

SECHQ112R0001

have against the Contractor, including the suspension and/or debarment of the Contractor. g. To include this Conflict of Interest clause, including this subparagraph, in all of the Contractor's subcontracts at all tiers (appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights hereunder) which involve the performance of work by subcontractors in support of this Contract. h. That, in addition to the remedies enumerated above, the Government may terminate this Contract for cause in the event of the Contractor's breach of any of the above restrictions.

H.8 Information Confidentiality (a) To the extent that the work under this contract/task order(s) requires that the contractor be given access to confidential or proprietary business, technical, financial information belonging to the government or other companies, including pre-decisional budget and acquisition sensitive information, the contractor shall, after receipt thereof, treat such information as confidential and agree not to appropriate such information to its own use or to disclose such information to third parties unless specifically authorized by the contracting officer in writing. The foregoing obligations, however, shall not apply to: 1. Information that, at the time of receipt by the contractor, is in the public domain; 2. Information, that is published after receipt thereof by the contractor or otherwise, becomes part of the public domain through no fault of the contractor; 3. Information that the contractor can demonstrate was in his possession at the time of receipt thereof and was not acquired directly or indirectly from the government or other companies; and 4. Information that the contractor can demonstrate was received by it from a third party that did not require the contractor to hold it in confidence. (b) The contractor shall obtain the written agreement, in a form satisfactory to the contracting officer, of each employee permitted access, whereby the employee agrees that he will not discuss, divulge or disclose any such information or data to any person or entity except those persons within the contractor's organization directly concerned with the performance of the contract. (c) The contractor agrees, if requested by the government, to sign an agreement identical, in all material respects, to the provisions of this clause, with each company supplying information to the contractor under this contract, and to supply a copy of such agreement to the contracting officer. From time to time upon request of the contracting officer, the contractor shall supply the government with reports itemizing information received as confidential, proprietary, predecisional budget information, or acquisition sensitive information, and setting forth the company or companies from which the contractor received such information. (d) The contractor agrees that upon request by the contracting officer it will execute a contracting officer approved agreement with any party whose facilities or proprietary data it is given access to or is furnished, restricting use and disclosure of the data or the information obtained from the

Page 39 of 49

SECHQ112R0001

facilities. Upon request by the contracting officer, contractor personnel shall also sign such an agreement. (e) This clause shall flow down to all subcontracts and teaming agreements. H.9 Background Investigations H.9.1 Pre-Employment Check. The Contractor shall be subject to a complete pre-employment check, which will be completed by the SEC.

The Contractor shall submit U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Standard Form 85P for each prospective employee. OPM Standard Form 85P is available at http://www.opm.gov/forms. The Government reserves the right of final approval for prospective employees. The pre-employment check shall include, but not be limited to the checks identified below. The Contractor shall make its best efforts to provide employees that pass the SEC's security screening. Failure of employee(s) to pass the security screening is not a justifiable cause for schedule slippages. The SEC is currently revising its security processes and there may be a change to this process by time of award. H.9.2 Criminal History Check. The SEC may contact local law enforcement authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to determine the criminal history of each prospective contract employee. H.9.3 Credit History Check. Credit history shall evidence the Contract employee to be responsible with credit obligations. A Contract employee receiving an unfavorable credit rating must be approved by the COTR prior to acceptance to this Contract. In the event of an unsatisfactory credit rating, the Contractor shall submit an explanation of the circumstances and the employee shall not be assigned to the contract prior to Contracting Officer approval. H.9.4 Background Checks. Due to the sensitive nature of the information contained in SEC filings and concerns regarding the security and integrity of this information, the SEC may conduct background checks of proposed key personnel in addition to reference checks. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor throughout the life of this contract to inform the SEC of any changes in its key personnel so that the appropriate background and reference checks may be conducted. The Contractor also agrees to include the substance of this clause in any of its subcontracts. The Contractor shall conduct a background investigation regarding the criminal record and credit history of all employees (including any subcontractor employees) who will be assigned to work on the contract. The Contractor shall not assign to work on the contract and shall immediately remove from work on the contract any employee who has been convicted within the past ten years of fraud or any other felony. The Contractor shall certify to the SEC that a background investigation has been conducted on each employee who is assigned to work on the contract. The Contractor shall conduct follow-up background investigations every twelve months on each employee assigned to the contract, unless the SEC directs otherwise.

The SEC has the right to require the removal of any Contractor personnel assigned to this contract, at any time, for any reason. H.10.1 Key Personnel. The Contractor shall designate specific senior level professional and managerial personnel as key personnel who are essential to the successful performance of work under this contract. Key personnel shall be available for full-time assignment as necessary to efficiently manage the work of the contract and shall be available on the effective date of award. Key personnel shall include the program manager, the POC (see H.10.3), a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in both the software and in contracting, and a system administrator if one is assigned to work at the SEC.
