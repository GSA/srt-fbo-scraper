                                 Bldg 1214 Command Training Room 22 Audio Visual/Video Conference System Upgrade



1. INTRODUCTION

I. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:
Building 1214 Room 22 is located in PHD NSWC’s Command Training Center. It is used as a classroom, conference room  and  VTC  center,  supporting
meetings, presentations, training sessions and video conferences. An upgraded video and audio communications system is required  to  replace  the
current outdated (and failed) system. Activities that are required to be carried out through this new system shall include: Playing audio  source
materials, projecting video source materials such as DVDs and Blu-ray discs, projecting computer displays, audience  participation  (via  ceiling
mounted microphones), videoconferencing, and recording event audio and video.  The  upgraded  system  must  display  content  as  well  as  allow
personnel to collaborate via VTC in High Definition (HD).  Output shall allow for quick and seamless integration with  high  definition  displays
and software shall allow users to easily and quickly share high quality documents, spreadsheets and multimedia content.  This  system  should  be
capable to operate as a Teleconferencing or Video Teleconferencing system.

Currently, VTC content is shown on outdated CRT displays on carts and presentations/videos are shown on a wall  mounted  screen  (low  resolution
video provided by a ceiling mounted projector). This upgrade shall provide high definition capable voice and video  and  allow  system  users  to
share multimedia content (video, presentations etc.) in high resolution. The government will provide a new  HD  ceiling  mounted  projector  (and
wall mounted screen for the projector). The vendor will provide, install and test a complete AV/VTC system, including  providing  and  installing
an LCD display in the front of the room and an LCD display on one side in the rear of the room. This Audio  Visual  system  upgrade  will  enable
users in Bldg 1214 room 22 to easily conduct real time communication and collaboration, provide sharp clear  images  and  deliver  natural  voice
clarity audio.

II. SCOPE:
The room called out in Section I above is the only room in Bldg 1214 that will require an AV/VTC system under this SOW. A job walk will  be  held

package for providing and installing the multimedia and VTC equipment in classroom 22 of Bldg 1214. The vendor will  purchase,  deliver,  install
and test the entire AV/VTC system for that room. The proposal must include a design  plan,  equipment  listing,  and  include  the  cost  of  all
equipment and installation/labor. This design shall include any changes/recommendations required to interface with existing Government  equipment
that can be utilized in the upgraded system. A site visit of the facility/room where the required equipment will be installed  is  required.  All
components installed must be fully operational prior to government testing/acceptance.  The  VTC  equipment  supplied  should  be  I/A  certified
through Joint interoperability test command.
