All Contractor employees, whose duties under this contract require their presence at any Treasury, or Treasury Bureau, facility, shall be clearly identifiable by a distinctive badge furnished by the Government. In addition, corporate identification badges shall be worn on the outer garment at all times. It is the sole responsibility of the Contractor to provide this corporate identification. Upon the termination of employment of any contractor personnel, all Government furnished identification shall be returned to the issuing office. All on-site contractor personnel shall abide by security regulations applicable to that site. The Contractor shall administer and maintain an internal accounting of its personnel relative to badges requested, lost and returned.

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

(1) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of a request for performance-based payment prior to successful accomplishment of the event or performance criterion for which payment is requested. The Contracting Officer shall determine whether the event or performance criterion for which payment is requested has been successfully accomplished in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Contracting Officer may, at any time, require the Contractor to substantiate the successful performance of any event or performance criterion which has been or is represented as being payable. (2) A payment under this performance-based payment clause is a contract financing payment under the Prompt Payment clause of this contract and not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act. The designated payment office will pay approved requests on the 30th day after receipt of the request for performance-based payment by the designated payment office. However, the designated payment office is not required to provide payment if the Contracting Officer requires substantiation as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, or inquires into the status of an event or performance criterion, or into any of the conditions listed in paragraph (e) of this clause, or into the Contractor certification. The payment period will not begin until the Contracting Officer approves the request. (3) The approval by the Contracting Officer of a request for performance-based payment does not constitute an acceptance by the Government and does not excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under this contract. (d) Liquidation of performance-based payments. (1) Performance-based finance amounts paid prior to payment for delivery of an item shall be liquidated by deducting a percentage or a designated dollar amount from the delivery payment. If the performance-based finance payments are on a delivery item basis, the liquidation amount for each such line item shall be the percent of that delivery item price that was previously paid under performance-based finance payments or the designated dollar amount. If the performance-based finance payments are on a whole contract basis, liquidation shall be by either predesignated liquidation amounts or a liquidation percentage. (2) If at any time the amount of payments under this contract exceeds any limitation in this contract, the Contractor shall repay to the Government the excess. Unless otherwise determined by the Contracting Officer, such excess shall be credited as a reduction in the unliquidated performance-based payment balance(s), after adjustment of invoice payments and balances for any retroactive price adjustments. (e) Reduction or suspension of performance-based payments. The Contracting Officer may reduce or suspend performance-based payments, liquidate performance-based payments by deduction from any payment under the contract, or take a combination of these actions after finding upon substantial evidence any of the following conditions:
28   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

(1) The Contractor failed to comply with any material requirement of this contract (which includes paragraphs (h) and (i) of this clause). (2) Performance of this contract is endangered by the Contractor's-- (i) Failure to make progress; or (ii) Unsatisfactory financial condition. (3) The Contractor is delinquent in payment of any subcontractor or supplier under this contract in the ordinary course of business. (f) Title. (1) Title to the property described in this paragraph (f) shall vest in the Government. Vestiture shall be immediately upon the date of the first performance-based payment under this contract, for property acquired or produced before that date. Otherwise, vestiture shall occur when the property is or should have been allocable or properly chargeable to this contract. (2) "Property," as used in this clause, includes all of the following described items acquired or produced by the Contractor that are or should be allocable or properly chargeable to this contract under sound and generally accepted accounting principles and practices: (i) Parts, materials, inventories, and work in process; (ii) Special tooling and special test equipment to which the Government is to acquire title under any other clause of this contract; (iii) Nondurable (i.e., noncapital) tools, jigs, dies, fixtures, molds, patterns, taps, gauges, test equipment and other similar manufacturing aids, title to which would not be obtained as special tooling under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this clause; and (iv) Drawings and technical data, to the extent the Contractor or subcontractors are required to deliver them to the Government by other clauses of this contract. (3) Although title to property is in the Government under this clause, other applicable clauses of this contract (e.g., the termination or special tooling clauses) shall determine the handling and disposition of the property. (4) The Contractor may sell any scrap resulting from production under this contract, without requesting the Contracting Officer's approval, provided that any significant reduction in the value of the property to which the Government has title under this clause is reported in writing to the Contracting Officer. (5) In order to acquire for its own use or dispose of property to which title is vested in the Government under this clause, the Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's advance approval of the action and the terms. If approved, the basis for payment (the events or performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable (if the property is part of or needed for

29   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause. (6) When the Contractor completes all of the obligations under this contract, including liquidation of all performance-based payments, title shall vest in the Contractor for all property (or the proceeds thereof) not-- (i) Delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this contract; or (ii) Incorporated in supplies delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this contract and to which title is vested in the Government under this clause. (7) The terms of this contract concerning liability for Government-furnished property shall not apply to property to which the Government acquired title solely under this clause. (g) Risk of loss. Before delivery to and acceptance by the Government, the Contractor shall bear the risk of loss for property, the title to which vests in the Government under this clause, except to the extent the Government expressly assumes the risk. If any property is damaged, lost, stolen, or destroyed, the basis of payment (the events or performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable (if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause. (h) Records and controls. The Contractor shall maintain records and controls adequate for administration of this clause. The Contractor shall have no entitlement to performance-based payments during any time the Contractor's records or controls are determined by the Contracting Officer to be inadequate for administration of this clause. (i) Reports and Government access. The Contractor shall promptly furnish reports, certificates, financial statements, and other pertinent information requested by the Contracting Officer for the administration of this clause and to determine that an event or other criterion prompting a financing payment has been successfully accomplished. The Contractor shall give the Government reasonable opportunity to examine and verify the Contractor's records and to examine and verify the Contractor's performance of this contract for administration of this clause. (j) Special terms regarding default. If this contract is terminated under the Default clause, (1) the Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the Government the amount of unliquidated performance-based payments, and (2) title shall vest in the Contractor, on full liquidation of all performance-based payments, for all property for which the Government elects not to require delivery under the Default clause of this contract. The Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the Default clause. (k) Reservation of rights. (1) No payment or vesting of title under this clause shall--
30   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

(i) Excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under this contract; or (ii) Constitute a waiver of any of the rights or remedies of the parties under the contract. (2) The Government's rights and remedies under this clause-- (i) Shall not be exclusive, but rather shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or this contract; and (ii) Shall not be affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise preclude or impair any further exercise under this clause or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the Government. (l) Content of Contractor's request for performance-based payment. The Contractor's request for performance-based payment shall contain the following: (1) The name and address of the Contractor; (2) The date of the request for performance-based payment; (3) The contract number and/or other identifier of the contract or order under which the request is made; (4) Such information and documentation as is required by the contract's description of the basis for payment; and (5) A certification by a Contractor official authorized to bind the Contractor, as specified in paragraph (m) of this clause. (m) Content of Contractor's certification. As required in paragraph (l)(5) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the following certification in each request for performance-based payment: I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that-- (1) This request for performance-based payment is true and correct; this request (and attachments) has been prepared from the books and records of the Contractor, in accordance with the contract and the instructions of the Contracting Officer; (2) (Except as reported in writing on __________), all payments to subcontractors and suppliers under this contract have been paid, or will be paid, currently, when due in the ordinary course of business; (3) There are no encumbrances (except as reported in writing on _________) against the property acquired or produced for, and allocated or properly chargeable to, the contract which would affect or impair the Government's title; (4) There has been no materially adverse change in the financial condition of the Contractor since the submission by the Contractor to the Government of the most recent written information dated _____________; and
31   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

(5) After the making of this requested performance-based payment, the amount of all payments for each deliverable item for which performance-based payments have been requested will not exceed any limitation in the contract, and the amount of all payments under the contract will not exceed any limitation in the contract.

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show-- (1) The solicitation number; (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; (4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation.

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration. (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during pre-award testing. (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately. (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-- (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

41   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

specific format requirements established above. Responses simply stating that the Offeror understands the requirement and will comply (or similar) may be considered non-responsive and unacceptable. (a) Volume I ­ Application Services Solution This volume shall contain sufficient information to enable the evaluators to make a complete analysis of the Offeror's proposed technical and management solution to deliver the required software application services described in the PWS. All available information pertaining specifically to the evaluation criteria shall be included, as well as any other information that the Offeror believes would demonstrate its ability to successfully accomplish the work. The Offeror is cautioned that any information submitted for subcontractors or team members may only be evaluated if a firm commitment with the team member or the individual is demonstrated by signed letters of intent, subcontracts, or teaming agreements (not included in page limits identified above). The Offeror shall submit the information in Volume I of the proposal in the following order: (1) An Executive Summary: The Offeror shall provide a summary to synopsize the key factors of the Offeror's Technical and Management approach. (2) Technical Approach: The Offeror shall provide a detailed response to each requirement identified in the PWS. The Offeror shall demonstrate in their response that they have a clear understanding of each specific requirement and its expected outcome. The Offeror shall ensure that each response is complete and comprehensive, and exemplifies the Offeror's ability to provide a complete and integrated solution to the full scope and depth of the ASSC requirements. The Offeror shall also address in their technical approach each deliverable requirement identified throughout the PWS. Major topics of discussion must include the Offeror's: 1. Approach to Transition including detailed schedule, organization, personnel, activities, and risk assigned to transition of operations and maintenance of the installed base of applications from the incumbent contractor to itself. This section of the proposal shall specifically address the requirements described in Task Order 0001 PWS (attachment 3), and shall be submitted as the Offeror's Draft Transition Plan. The transition approach shall also detail the Offeror's capability to perform or obtain personnel to ensure that there are no gaps in O&M activities (CLIN 002). For example, if the incumbent is unable to perform all O&M activities during the transition period, a plan shall be in place to ensure that O&M activities continue without interruption. If this scenario occurs, the Government intends to issue a separate order on a Time & Materials basis for O&M services during the transition period until the CLIN 002 FFP order is activated.

Pricing and Price Proposal Workbook ­ (CD copy shall be saved in word)

Attachment 2 includes an overall summary schedule, sample labor categories schedule and task order tables. Offerors may use the sample labor categories as guidance or for informational purposes. Attachment 2 includes the following: ˇ Overall Summary Table o Task 1 ­ Transition ­ Firm Fixed Price o Task 2 ­ O&M ­ Firm Fixed Price. Note that the offeror's proposed Firm Fixed Price for CLINs 1002, 2002, 3002 and 4002 will be adjusted for evaluation purposes in accordance with the Index Model Pricing. o Task 3 ­ Other Task Areas ­ These tasks may be issued as firm fixed price, time and materials, labor hour or a hybrid. For evaluation purposes, the price for these task areas is determined using the sample task. Instructions: Offeors shall not alter this document and shall enter their proposed Firm Fixed Price for CLINs 0001, 0002, 5002, and 6002. For CLINs 1002, 2002, 3002 and 4002, offerors should enter the evaluated price. The evaluated price is the proposed Firm Fixed Price, as adjusted by the Index Model Pricing tables described below. For CLIN X003, Offerors shall first determine a price for the sample task in accordance with Attachment 2. Based on historical data, the Treasury estimates that there will be approximately five projects of similar size and complexity to the sample task each year. Therefore, the offeror's sample task price will be multiplied by five for the base year and each full option year. ˇ ID/IQ Labor Category Schedule (Includes labor categories, rates, and material handling fee).

Instructions: Offerors shall provide labor categories and fully-burdened labor rates for all direct labor (both prime and subcontractor). Each offeror shall determine the labor categories required to support all task areas. Offerors proposals shall also state the material costs, material handling fees and any indirect cost pursuant to FAR Clause 52-212-4 and 52.212-4, ATL I for Time and Materials and Labor Hour Task Orders. The Labor Category Schedule will not be part of the offeror's total evaluated price. However, Treasury will review the proposed labor rates, and the year-to-year rates of escalation, for reasonableness.
54

ˇ

Task Order 0001 (Refer to Attachment 3 ­ Transition - FFP) Schedule

Instructions: Offerors shall not alter this document and shall enter their proposed price for CLIN 0001. Offerors shall complete all requested information about labor rates, hours, materials, etc. for this FFP task. This will allow the Government to understand how the Offeror arrived at its FFP for purposes of verifying price reasonableness. As discussed in the Addendum to FAR 52.212-1 instructions for Volume I, Treasury may issue a separate task order during the transition period for O&M services. If such an order is issued, it will be priced on a Time & Materials basis, and therefore is not included in the FFP for Task Order 001.

ˇ

Task Order 0002 (Refer to Attachment 4 ­ O&M- FFP) Schedule

Instructions: Offeors shall utilize the tables provided to enter their proposed Firm Fixed Prices for CLIN X002. Offerors shall complete all requested information about labor rates, hours, materials, etc. for this FFP task. This will allow the Government to understand how the Offeror arrived at its FFP for purposes of verifying price reasonableness. o The special instructions below will apply to additional, retiring, or consolidation of applications. Offerors shall provide their pricing in accordance with the index model. o For each year of the contract, offerors shall propose a fixed unit price for each of the five levels described in the model. Treasury will review the proposed fixed unit prices for reasonableness. o For purposes of determining the total evaluated price, Offerors shall utilize their proposed index pricing to complete the four tables at the end of Attachment 2. The tables assume the following changes: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Addition of One Level Two Retirement of One Level One Reclassification of One Level One to a Level Two Reclassification of One Level Two to a Level Three

55   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

o The Index Model Pricing tables will be used to determine the evaluated total price for CLINs 1002, 2002, 3002, and 4002. Fixed Price (Rate) - Model for O&M Pricing The Government seeks to utilize a simplified and objective model to determine the annual fixed price cost to support the operation and maintenance (O&M) of applications and/or a portfolio of applications. This model shall enable individual Treasury Program Offices to budget and fund the O&M task orders using pre-determined pricing for each contract year of the contract based upon the complexity level of the application/portfolio. Each level is clearly discernable, based upon seven (7) explicit, fundamental characteristics. O&M funding shall be on an annual basis and billed monthly under a Funding Source Annual O&M Task Orders. The following are guiding principles for the O&M pricing.

Business Criteria: The model shall: 1. Present a single annual fixed price cost for each of the five (5) category levels indicated in the table below. 2. The O&M support for each application/application portfolio shall be priced, funded, and invoiced at that fixed price for the category level in which that application/application portfolio is classified. 3. All applications classified within that category level shall incur the same fixed "unit" price for their annual O&M support. 4. O&M Task Orders will be issued on funding source basis with a task order being for either a single application or as broad as multiple portfolios, as defined by the funding source. 5. It shall be the Offeror's responsibility to establish the annual fixed price to render the annual O&M support while meeting the reliability and availability encompassing typical industry "break-fix", configuration changes, and maintenance work to sustain the application(s) within the Level. 6. Changing of a application's/portfolio's designation will only occur through: a. Completion of development task order that changes the fundamental characteristics of an application;
56   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

b. Modification of a Task Order documenting the termination of an application's O&M requirement; c. Modification of a Task Order that represents a negotiated administrative change in classification. Definitions: 1. Application: A standalone unit of executable software to perform a defined function.

2. Portfolio: An aggregate of related applications typically associated with a common business function or funding sources. A portfolio is typically established for administrative purposes; and O&M pricing shall be for the portfolio of discreet applications. 3. Operations & Maintenance (O&M): O&M support is defined as those labor, license, and other contract allowed costs enabling the on-going operation ("caring and feeding") of the application/portfolio within the contract defined SLAs. This includes labor and services which includes: (a) standard production cycle operational support; (b) "breakfix" work, (c) configuration changes to accommodate standard OS, security, or COTS patches & releases to ensure sustained operation, and (d) application change releases not to exceed five-hundred twenty-five (525) per contract year  (note for FY09, a total of 505 
changes were made to the application base.  For the changes made, 57 were major, and 448  were minor changes). Pricing shall be for the base period and each option period.

Excluded from the fixed price O&M application support activities are: technology upgrades, overall modernization, or fundamental functionality or capability changes. These shall be considered development (New Work) activities. Operational Concept: Discrete application or portfolio pricing shall be fixed priced based upon the Index model below consisting of five (5) Indexed Levels also listed below. Each Level category consists of seven (7) characteristics. 1. Establishing Category Level: Determination shall be derived and substantiated, either through the GFE baseline information or as part of the SDLC design documentation prepared by the contractor. These attributes shall determine the Level Category in which the application shall be classified; and, thereby the fixed price cost for O&M support of an application or portfolio established.
57   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

2.

Diverse Attribute Alignment: Since a given application or portfolio may have one or more attributes outside a given category level, the level determination shall be based upon which level the majority (4 of the 7) attributes apply. The Government shall make the final determination. In those cases where there are not clear majority attributes within a given level, the CO and COTR shall derive a level determination from an overall average ranking.

3. Development Conversion to O&M: Application(s) or an application portfolio(s) in development shall become part of the Fixed Price O&M after the application becomes operational. This will be based on the index model (pro-rated depending on the timing) and funding will be obligated prior to the conversion. 4. Application Termination: If an O&M application is operationally terminated/Ceases operation support, the funding task order shall be modified to terminate the application and portfolio; and, thereby cancelling further work and charges for the balance of the performance period and contract. Funding adjustments will be made at the time of cancelation. 5. Re-Classification: If an existing O&M application or portfolio has either a development task order completed that results in changing the category level determination or one or more applications in a portfolio are terminated (permanently ceased operation). Adjustment to the fixed price determination of the application or portfolio shall be implemented prior to the re-classification.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final

73   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

PART VI EVALUATION CRITERIA 10.0 - 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors, listed in the descending order of importance, shall be used to evaluate offers: a) Application Services Solution a. Technical Approach b. Management Approach
82   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

c. Key Personnel Qualifications b) Performance Risk a. Past Performance b. Corporate Experience and Capabilities c) Price The non-price factors collectively, are significantly more important than price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision) 10.1 ADDENDUM to 52.212-2 As stated in 52.212-2, entitled Evaluation ­ Commercial Item, the factors that shall be used to evaluate the offers are Application Services Solution, Performance Risk and Price with award being made to the Offeror that provides the best overall value to the Government. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions; therefore, each initial offer shall contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. If the Government decides that discussions are necessary, the CO will establish a competitive range of the most highly rated Offeror(s). If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of Offerors in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of Offerors in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated Offerors.
83   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

The Government will evaluate the following factors and sub-factors: Factor 1: Application Services Solution Treasury will evaluate the Offeror's Application Services solution using the following three subfactors listed in descending order of importance: 1. 2. 3. Technical Approach Management Approach Key Personnel Qualifications

Technical Approach: Treasury will evaluate the: 1. Offeror's Transition plan (schedule, activities, personnel, and organization) to successfully transition the operations and maintenance (O&M) contract within the 90day transition period without any disruption of service to the user community or OCIO management. 2. Offeror's proposed approach to O&M services, in order to determine the extent to which the approach: a. Provides quantifiable operational efficiencies, and b. presents the lowest performance risk to the Government. 3. Offeror's proposed approach to the sample task order (Attachment 20), in order to determine the extent to which the approach: a. Demonstrates a sound understanding of the requirement; b. demonstrates a capable and sound solution; and c. presents the lowest performance risk to the Government. 4. Degree to which the Offeror's technical approach will ensure attainment of ASSC program objectives stated in the PWS, including any risks associated with the specific proposed methodologies and processes. Probability of success that the Offeror's technical approach demonstrates accomplishing the work described in the PWS (All Task Areas). The Government will also evaluate the proposed labor categories to ensure that they are complete and accurate.

84   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

5. The quality and adequacy of the Offeror's Software Development Life Cycle Methodology as it pertains to accomplishing the requirements of the ASSC PWS. 6. Offeror's approach to ensuring how they will meet the performance metrics defined in the SLAs to include technical management and quality assurance processes and procedures supported by automated tools to objectively collect, track, and report on actual performance against the established SLAs. 7. The Offeror's stated ability to attain an independent assessment of CMMI maturity level 2 by an SEI-certified assessor. Management Approach Treasury will evaluate: 1. How the Offeror's Management Plan ensures that the Treasury achieves established ASSC program objectives, while mitigating performance risk. 2. The degree of autonomy assigned to the Program team in decision making authority from corporate. 3. The Offeror on its ability to effectively and efficiently accomplish, administer, and manage the day to day operations including project organization, performance monitoring and control activities, quality assurance, subcontractors and/or teaming arrangements, and task order management process. Key Personnel Qualifications: Treasury will evaluate the Offeror's selection of key personnel positions and the relative role of these positions within the program team. Treasury will evaluate the Offeror on the availability, experience and qualifications of the proposed key personnel relative to the tasks specified in the PWS. Treasury will specifically evaluate the experience and skills of the proposed key personnel in successfully managing and delivering services in a performance-based application support services environment, and how their experience translates to lowering contract performance risk. Factor 2: Performance risk Treasury will evaluate the Offeror's performance risk using the following two sub-factors in descending order of importance: 1. Past Performance 2. Corporate Experience and Capabilities

85   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

Past Performance: The Offeror will be evaluated on its past performance. The Government will conduct a past performance assessment based on the quality of the Offeror's past performance (including past performance of its subcontractors or teammates if proposed), for contracts that meet the currency and relevancy standards established by the Government, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. The source of information regarding past performance, the context of the data and general trends in performance may also be considered. In addition to the past performance questionnaires submitted, the Government may use information provided by the Offeror in its proposal submission, information in both Government and commercial databases (e.g., NIH Contractor Performance System ­ CPS), and other information readily available to Treasury. If there is no relevant past performance, the Offeror will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably, and such lack of relevant past performance will be considered an neutral risk under this factor. Corporate Experience and Capabilities: The Government will evaluate the quality and quantity of the Offeror's corporate experience and capabilities to determine the likelihood of successful performance on this contract. Specifically the government will evaluate: 1. How similar the Offeror's qualifications and experience are compared to the required services outlined in the PWS. In its evaluation, the Government will consider the quantity and quality of the Offeror's experience, and determine the extent of time such services have been provided to the Offeror's government and commercial clients. This includes the Offeror's team (if proposed) and the applicability of the team members' (or subcontractors') experience and background to the area(s) for which they have been assigned responsibility. The specific capabilities and the corporate expertise the Offeror has in each of the service areas identified in the PWS.

2.

Factor 3: Price
Price analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b) to determine reasonableness. The offeror's total evaluated price will be determined in accordance with Attachment 2, and as described in the instructions for Volume III ­ Business Proposal. For the sample task order the Government estimates that there will be approximately 5 task order requests per each full year of contract performance similar in size and scope. As a result, the Government will multiply the sample task order price by 5 for each year of the contract period for purposes of determining the evaluated prices for CLINs 0003, 1003, 2003, 3003, 4003, 5003, and 6003. . 86   

SOLICITATION A10006 
 

The index model fixed unit prices, material handling rate, and labor category rates will be evaluated to determine that they are reasonable. Also for evaluation purposes the index model prices (rates) will be used to determine evaluated prices for CLINs 1002, 2002, 3002 and 4002. The evaluated price is the proposed Firm Fixed Price, as adjusted by the Index Model Pricing tables.

Rating System: Rating Exceptional Standard Exceptional quality; offers one or more significant strengths not offset by weaknesses; very good probability of success with overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. High quality; offers one or more strengths not offset by weaknesses; good probability of success with overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. Acceptable quality; any strengths are offset by weaknesses; fair probability of success with overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. Marginal quality; one or more weaknesses not offset by strengths; low probability of success with generally high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.

Good

Acceptable

Marginal

Unacceptable A proposal which contains major errors, omissions, or deficiencies, or an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements; and these conditions cannot be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.

Neutral (N)*

No past performance available for evaluation.

Software Configuration Management Plan

Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP)
1 Introduction
Software Configuration Management (SCM) is a discipline applying technical and administrative direction and supervision over the life cycle of Software Configuration Items (SCIs). The SCM process manages and tracks changes made to the project software, hardware and documentation components, and establishes and maintains the integrity of these components throughout the project life cycle. Effective SCM includes the following steps: ˇ Identification and Documentation of the functional and physical characteristics of SCIs ˇ Change Control of the SCIs and the related documentation ˇ Status Accounting of proposed and approved changes ˇ Design Review and Configuration Audit to verify conformance of the SCIs to the documented requirements SCM is not accomplished at any specific point in a project. Instead, it is integrated with the definition, design, development, and maintenance of the project life cycle. A Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP) defines all of the activities, processes, procedures, roles, responsibilities, and resources necessary to implement SCM for a project. Once reviewed and approved, the SCMP is used as the basis for performing SCM activities throughout the life cycle of the project.

2

Scope

The general SCM processes in this plan are applicable to all projects under the Application Systems Support Contract (ASSC). Individual projects may have additional and/or unique SCM requirements because of the development environment, tools to be used, or its selected development methodology. Project specific SCM requirements, plans or tailoring actions will be documented in the Project Plan (PP) of the individual project. The SCMP and the SCM section of the PP comprise the documented SCMP of the project.

ASSC Software Configuration Management Group

This subsection describes the specific positions that make up the ASSC SCM group. Each of these positions is associated with a fully funded Government position. These are the resources that have been designated as necessary to accomplish the SCM activities required for the ASSC.

3.1

ASSC Change Control Board (CCB)

The ASSC CCB is the governing body that authorizes the identification of SCIs and controls changes to the approved baselines. The ASSC CCB examines requested changes to systems, directs the change request impact analysis when necessary, and approves, denies, or defers the changes proposed for the system. The ASSC CCB may also prioritize changes based on release functionality. The project customer fulfills the function of the ASSC CCB under the ASSC contract.

3.2

ASSC Project Manager (ASSC PM)

The PM has complete responsibility for the project. The PM directs, controls, administers, and regulates the development of the hardware and/or software system. The PM is ultimately responsible to the customer.

Configuration Identification

Configuration identification refers to the steps required to isolate items to be controlled, track their status, and report their configuration. It includes the selection and definition of all functional and physical characteristics that make up a system. This delineation allows the individuals involved in the evolution of the system to communicate effectively using a common language. It provides a basis for applying configuration control to the development and integration of the system. When accomplished correctly, configuration identification results in a complete and accurate representation of the system. Standard Configuration Items (CIs) may include User Requirements, Functional Requirements, System Design, Test Procedures, and all code releases. The CIs are those items that are identified as requiring configuration management. At specific points in the project life cycle, these CIs are baselined as an approved configuration. These baselines act as measurable progress points and quality checkpoints, create a basis for subsequent development, and facilitate the control of future changes. The baselines are agreed upon through formal reviews involving users, developers, and the system sponsors. All parties must agree that user requirements are clearly defined and that functional requirements are unambiguous, complete, consistent, relevant, feasible, and verifiable. After this group has agreed on a baseline, they pass that information to the SCM as a basis for future change control.

4.1

Configuration Items

All software developed and maintained under the ASSC contract which have been identified as a Software Configuration Item (SCI) by the Project Manager/Team Lead include but are not limited to the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Code Compilers Data Management Plan Design Documents Drawings Internal Work Orders (IWO) Internal Work Proposals (IWP) Measurement and Analysis Plan Preliminary Project Plans Process Descriptions 3 Mar 10, 2006

4.2

Configuration Management Records

The management of configuration records is accomplished through the following typical work products: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Revision history of configuration items Change log Copy of the change requests Status of configuration items Differences between baselines

Examples of these work products can be viewed in Appendix G.

4.3

ASSC Projects

All software developed and maintained under the ASSC contract which has been identified as a CI by the Project Manager must be controlled through Version Manager (VM). Each active project includes source code, documentation, and build files. Go to the ASSC portal for a list of the ASSC projects. This plan applies to all ASSC projects.

4.3.1

ASSC Project Categories

Please see the InfoPro Treasury ASSC SDLC Workflow and Processes Handbook, Addendum H: Policy ­ Project Category Determination for a description of project category assignments.

4.3.2

ASSC Project Category Policy

All projects in all categories under change management must be reproducible. The documentation package (baseline and all changes) must be sufficient to produce a working system in a disaster recovery situation. The entire system (without data) must be reproducible from the artifact repository. To demonstrate disaster recovery, production backup tapes may only be used to recover database structure and current data, but no program files, configuration files or configuration settings. 4 Mar 10, 2006
SCMP v2.6

Software Configuration Management Plan
All database changes must be scripted and included in the deployment plan for the release in which they are made.

Configuration Control

Control is maintained over the configuration of the work product baseline. This control includes tracking the configuration of each of the configuration items, approving a new configuration if necessary, and updating the baseline. Configuration control is the process of evaluating, coordinating, approving, and implementing all approved changes to functional and physical characteristics of the baselined CIs. These changes may occur internally during project development or externally after items are delivered for customer approval. They may involve new requirements or modifications indicated through testing and review. The purpose of configuration control is to protect the integrity of the baseline, estimate the potential cost and schedule effects of suggested changes, and support effective decision-making regarding proposed changes. It is important to note that configuration control is not implemented until after CIs are identified and baselined (i.e., frozen) through a formal review process. After those baselines are set and communicated to the PM/TL and the SCM, any future changes must be cleared through the configuration control process. The configuration control process is initiated when any individual with knowledge of the project identifies a potential need for system modification. This need may be identified during design, development, testing, or deployment. Changes can arise from new requirements, software bugs, problems identified in testing, or acceptance issues. Regardless of who identifies the potential need or what its nature is, when it is identified the procedure for approving or implementing the change is essentially the same. When applied to software, configuration control is accomplished through a set of procedures that preserve the integrity of the system when approved changes are made or when restoration of the system is required due to disaster or other unusual circumstances. Software control ensures that changes to computer programs are developed and tested using valid copies of programs and test databases, and that such changes do not adversely affect system users. Software control procedures are particularly important for documenting and tracking maintenance changes during the operation phase of the life cycle. However, software control is also important for controlling changes during the planning, development, and installation of systems and system enhancements.

5.1

Configuration Control Tools

InfoPro completed the implementation of Tracker for the ASSC in early 2004. This suite of configuration management tools includes: ˇ VM organizes, manages and protects software during the development process. VM automates common tasks and protects against lost changes, overwrites and content errors. Tracker captures, manages and communicates software defects, project issues and change requests. Change requests are linked with the development files managed by VM, providing a traceable and complete set of dependent information including affected code, issues, changes, responsibilities and status.

ˇ

These tools automate many tasks associated with the SDLC workflow and thus support the implementation of repeatable processes and configuration management. They maintain the revision history of configuration items and the archives of the baselines. InfoPro will provide training with these tools to team members as part of the Tracker and VM implementation effort.

SCMP v2.6

Software Configuration Management Plan 5.2 Change Requests

There is one category of request for a change to a project's configuration. This change request is managed through Tracker. The change request is referred to as a Software Change Request (SCR) and it is used to manage five (5) different types of requests: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Bug Fixes Data Fixes Enhancements System Maintenance Requests User Support Requests

There is one method for creating and managing change requests for ASSC documents, templates and processes.

5.2.1 Software Change Requests (SCRs)
5.2.1.1 5.2.1.2 5.2.1.3 5.2.1.4 An SCR is submitted either verbally or through written documentation by the client to the PM/TL. The PM/TL evaluates the request and enters it into Tracker. The PM/TL assigns one or more Developers through Tracker, to implement the change. The assigned Developer(s) are notified via an email generated by Tracker. The Developer(s) program and unit test the SCR. After the Developer(s) complete the programming and unit testing to their satisfaction, they enter the successful results into Tracker. The PM/TL is notified of the successful results via an email generated by Tracker. The PM/TL reviews the change and enters the successful status into Tracker. The PM/TL promotes the code in VM to Integration Testing. The Test Manager is notified via an email generated by Tracker that the Test Team can begin Integration Testing. Integration Testing issues are resolved between the PM/TL, the Developer(s), and the Test Manager. After the Test Team completes the Integration Testing to their satisfaction, the Test Manager is notified and enters the results into Tracker. The PM/TL is notified of the results via an email generated by Tracker. The PM/TL notifies the customer that the SCR is ready for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). The Project Manager/Team Lead is responsible for arranging and managing the UAT. The Project Manager/Team Lead arranges with the SCM for the release of the SCR into a UAT environment. After the UAT has been completed to the satisfaction of the customer, the results are documented through entry into Tracker. The CM is notified of the approved results via an email generated by Tracker. The Project Manager/Team Lead designates and documents the version (release number) with which the change or fix will be deployed within the Version Control Application (VCA). The Project Manager/Team Lead arranges with the SCM for the release of the SCR into production.

5.3

Configuration Management Orientation and Training

Training in Configuration Management activities and responsibilities will occur at two levels. The initial level is a general orientation on the Configuration Management activities and responsibilities as well as a brief introduction to CMMI if necessary. The initial level of training is an 6 Mar 10, 2006
SCMP v2.6

Software Configuration Management Plan
orientation for all new hires or individuals to the ASSC team. This orientation is part of the in processing orientation for these individuals. This orientation will include an overview on conducting Configuration Management activities and the importance of processes and product quality. The second level training is a "hands-on" orientation to both Version Manager and Tracker. The second level is a more detailed level and includes the "how to do" Configuration Management activities such as baselining and auditing activities. The training material and training attendance lists are maintained in Version Manager.

5.4

Configuration Control of Configuration Management Work Products

The SCMP and the work products generated as part of the configuration management processes will be placed in VM.. Control is maintained over the configuration of the work product baseline through tracking the configuration of each of the configuration items, approving a new configuration if necessary, and updating the baseline. (see Section 5.2 ­ Change Requests) The typical work products used to track change requests include the: ˇ ˇ Revision history of configuration items Archives of the baselines

Examples of these work products can be viewed in Appendix G.

6

Configuration Status Accounting

The configuration status accounting process is managed by the SCM. The configuration status accounting process is used to maintain project baselines and monitor status throughout the SDLC. This is accomplished by tracking and checking the baseline at the designated milestones reviews identified in the Project Plan. Configuration accounting procedures detail the documentation of configuration item baselines and changes to the baselines. Additional requirements established during the project life cycle are tracked as changes to the baseline. The additional requirements may impact the system's interface, functionality, behavior, performance, operation, quality, security, or constraints.

6.1

CM Repository and Baselines

Project baselines (documentation or code) are added to the CM repository as they are developed. The CM repository for a project is composed of two components: ˇ ˇ a software code repository a set of project development folders for the management of documentation and artifacts

VM is the ASSC tool which serves as the software code repository. The tool used for a specific project can be found documented in the Project Plan for those cases where a customer specified tool is required. Changes to baselines and releases of products built from the repository are systematically controlled through change control and auditing functions. The repository provides storage, retrieval, sharing, archiving, and backup functions for CIs. The documentation for each baselined CI is stored in electronic format. The documentation uniquely identifies each CI with a specific description, release number, date, and change status, and also names the owner of the CI. The documentation includes information as to what was deployed and how it was deployed. After completion of a project, the SCM archives all baseline documentation to a system maintenance folder. A minimum of two baselines will be generated for each project: ˇ ˇ a baseline is generated prior to the application being released for the User Acceptance Test (UAT) a baseline is generated prior to the application being released into production 7 Mar 10, 2006
SCMP v2.6

Software Configuration Management Plan
Projects may include additional baselines where appropriate during the earlier stages of the project's life cycle.

6.1.1 Baseline Creation
The project team will do the following to create a baseline: ˇ ensure all documentation is brought up to date for the current stage of the project's life cycle. The documentation will be promoted to the appropriate level in VM to uniquely identify it for the baseline being prepared. All files for deployment will be promoted to the appropriate level in VM to uniquely identify them for the baseline being prepared.

ˇ

6.1.2 Code or Documentation Release
The project team will do the following to release code or documentation for a change: ˇ ˇ ˇ the CIs should be properly documented approval or authorization to change the code should be obtained from the ASSC CCB. For documentation, the version in the project development folders will be copied and versioned. The prior version will be moved into the archive folder for that document.

6.2

Status and Communication

The SCM will make all documentation available electronically to the Project Team and the Customer. Configuration Item status will be recorded and communicated to the project team and management. These are the primary inputs for the CM status accounting process.

6.2.1 Minutes of Customer Meetings
Documents, discussions, and decisions pertaining to configuration accounting.

6.2.2 Work Product List (WPL)
The WPL documents which work product items are designated as CIs for the system under development. It also records the baseline technical documentation of a system controlled by CM. Recorded data may include the system name/release/version, title of the document, publication date, and revision number. The WPL should accompany the Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) documentation.

6.2.3 Software Code Repository
Provides the status of the project code, listing all code modules associated with the system and what modules may be checked out or checked in.

6.3

Status Documentation

To document status at designated milestones or when required by the Project Manager, the project team will do the following: ˇ ˇ Provide the document version number and date for all project documentation. Ensure all completed or updated code modules have been checked-in and then prepare a report of current code modules including version information.

This status report will provide the project manager with the information that differentiates deliverables, documentation and code. 8 Mar 10, 2006

Configuration Audits

Configuration audits examine configuration records (e.g., the required products and related documents submitted for inclusion in a baseline) to accomplish the following: ˇ ˇ Verify the success of the change control and identification processes Ensure the configuration records are complete, clearly presented, and internally consistent

System evaluations include configuration audits to check for adherence to standards and support reviews. Audits are not intended to make qualitative evaluations of the programmatic or technical content of the product. Instead, they help ensure that those types of reviews and evaluations are not applied to products that are not ready for such a review.

7.1

Functional Configuration Audit

A Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) validates that a system is developed in accordance with the requirement definition (i.e., in compliance with the Requirements Document). It ensures that technical documentation and test analysis reports accurately specify functional, operational, performance, and design characteristics. Every requirement is matched to design criteria, which is in turn is matched to a test scenario. In systems engineering, an FCA is an important part of quality assurance and is an important activity within configuration management. An FCA ensures that the functionality of a configuration item as demonstrated by the test and evaluation effort is the same as that documented in the Development Specification and the Product Specification for that configuration item. An FCA may be conducted as determined by a senior manager for each configuration item, or a continuous audit may be conducted progressively over the development of the configuration item. Where the functionality of a particular configuration item may depend on other configuration items, the FCA may not be complete until system integration. FCA audit will occur at least twice; once prior to TRR and again prior to the PRR.

7.2

Physical Configuration Audit

A Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) validates the system baseline. The PCA ensures items specified are physically available for acceptance testing or to be placed into production. A PCA is part of the configuration management activities undertaken within the quality assurance activities of systems engineering. A PCA examines the as-built configuration item against the various specifications such as product specifications and other design data, and ensures that the physical as-built configuration is the same as that described by these specifications. A PCA is conducted twice; once prior to the TRR and prior to the PRR. The PRR is on the final version (the as-built version) of each configuration item.

SCM Process Improvement
8.1 Overview
SCM metrics provide specific information on the evolving product and insight into the functioning of the SCM process. A related goal of monitoring the SCM process is to discover opportunities for 9 Mar 10, 2006
SCMP v2.6

Software Configuration Management Plan
process improvement. Quantitative measurements against SCM process metrics provide a good means for monitoring the effectiveness of SCM activities on an ongoing basis. These measurements are useful in characterizing the current state of the process as well as providing a basis for making comparisons over time. Analysis of the measurements may produce insights leading to process changes and corresponding updates to the SCMP.

8.2

Procedure for Measurements and Analysis

The Software Configuration Management (SCM) metrics focus on identifying and tracking SCM tasks at the project level. This provides a complete view of the level and performance of SCM being applied. The Configuration Manager (CM) is responsible for implementing this process. Use the following steps and the worksheet from Appendix G to determine the SCM metrics: 1. Identify SCM metrics to be collected which can improve application development, help in improving SCM processes, and meet SCM objectives. ˇ At a minimum, collect the following SCM metric at the project level: ˇ Collect the Measurement and Analysis efforts being expended for the time it takes to create the Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) and the time it takes to complete, validate, and enter the PCA (free from issues and corrections) into the project artifact repository. 2. Establish a metrics collection process. The more automated the process can be, the better the metrics collection will be. This may involve scripting/coding a metric collection solution or acquiring a metrics collection technology. In the case of timing the process, we can entrust this to the members involved in the process, specifically the PM's and the CM. 3. Determine what will be reported for the SCM metrics for future collection. 4. Periodically, the CM will review the metrics, identify opportunities for improvement, and work with the SEPG to prepare action plans to implement improvement efforts.

Configuration Management Reporting
9.1 Conduct Senior Management Project Planning Review(s)
Configuration management activities are reviewed with senior management as part of the weekly project management activities. The ASSC Project Manager meets bi-weekly with the ASSC Program manager and COTR at the bi-weekly contract review meetings to discuss any configuration management issues. The Software Configuration Manager meets with the ASSC Project Manager on an exception basis as necessary. The ASSC Project Manager and project development team, including the Software Configuration Manager (SCM) are involved in a number of reviews during the course of the project (for instance, the PRR). The reviews will include internal reviews by the development team and formal reviews at designated milestones. The ASSC Project Manager will brief senior management, the customer, and any pertinent external organizations. During this time the configuration management process will be discussed as part of the overall implementation of the SDLC.

How to complete the Physical Configuration Audit (PCA)
The following numbers relate exactly to the PCA form in Appendix E of the Software Configuration Management Plan. The recommended technique is to copy the PCA form from the SCM Plan, paste it into a blank document, and append the minutes of the PCA directly after the form. This keeps any notes and comments with the form. Requirements - Pre-TRR (This is a document review) 1) Approved final draft of the Deployment Plan: The deployment plan should be clear enough so that someone other than the developer should be able to deploy the software release. All instructions should start with the file location in Version Manager. 2) Release Notes: This is the project Release Notes for the applicable release. Locate and review the document in Version Manager and supply the path, file name, and revision level. 3) FCA minutes for each configuration item: Locate and review the document in Version Manager and supply the path, file name, and revision level. Requirements - Pre-PRR (This is a document review) 1) Approved final draft of the Deployment Plan: The deployment plan should be clear enough so that someone other than the developer should be able to deploy the software release. All instructions should start with the file location in Version Manager. 2) Final Release Notes: These are the project Release Notes for the applicable release. Locate and review the document in Version Manager and supply the path, file name, and revision level. 3) FCA minutes with revisions as necessary for each configuration item: Same as for Pre-Test, but now in final form with changes noted. Tasks 1) Ensure the discrepancies noted during the FCA on each CI have been corrected: Discrepancies should be noted in the PCA minutes, and the version labels of the changed files must be updated. a) All Configuration Items, including source code, scripts, documentation related to this release must be promoted to the appropriate level in VM. Within Version Manager there are ways to assign version labels to blocks of files simultaneously as long as all the files in that block are at their tip revision. Files which have been checked out for the next release must be version labeled individually to be sure you label the release number on the correct revision. 2) Review deployment plan. The installation plan will be specific to a given project, but it should include: a) Details which the "gatekeeper" can follow to implement the production release. This can be a CD of files, SQL scripts, or whatever is required, but it should always refer back to Version Manager and the applicable file locations. b) A rollback procedure in the event the upgrade fails. c) The ideal time frame for the installation to occur, such as when users do not need the system. There are also rules about no system changes while the Secretary is traveling, so the installer must know if this affects rollout. d) All code to be placed on the target server (and/ or workstation if the application is client/ server based) should be in a release folder. The structure of the build folder can be specific to a project, but it should closely match the server configuration. Within the build folder should be a configuration folder if specific system settings need to be made to the server or workstation, such as IIS virtual directories, registry settings, ODBC settings, etc. e) The release folders, where applicable, can be compared to the test server's directories.

Software Configuration Management Plan
The software Configuration manager will review individual software files between the pre-test and pre-production "snapshots". Several software tools/products will be used to compare program source code and database scripts. The following three products may be used as applicable. i) An Oracle change management tool will be used to make a baseline both before and after implementation of a software release. The tool will show details of individual changes. ii) Microsoft SQL2000 or 6.5 ­ Enterprise Manager can generate a SQL script which could recreate the database on the same server or a different server to compare database changes. The resulting ASCII files can be compared using the KDiff3 tool. iii) Kdiff3 tool ­ can look at program source code differences between new source code and the baseline. The tool compares the text input files or directories against the baseline software under Version Manager. The tool shows the differences line by line and character by character. 3) Review Release Notes. Once the new release has been deployed, verify that nothing changed between final release and actual deployment, and note any exceptions in the PCA minutes, plus follow up to insure that the Version Manager files are current. a) Typical situations that would arise are forgotten virtual directories, and server file folder permissions (which may be more restrictive than the test environment) may affect user access. b) Be sure that every exception is noted and corrected. Remember that the PCA should be checked into Version Manager under the documentation area of the applicable software release. Please also notify Software Quality Assurance and the ASSC Project Manager that this document is completed, and where it is located in Version Manager, plus the revision level. f)

Introduction

The Treasury Department has an extensive variety of systems, all of which are governed by the rules and principles of the Information System Life Cycle (ISLC). This manual is provided to assist bureaus in the general standardization of life cycle management of their information systems. Standardization ensures that systems are developed, acquired, evaluated and operated in an efficient manner, within prescribed budgets and schedule constraints, and responsive to mission requirements. II. Purpose

The ISLC manual provides Treasury and associated bureau project managers charged with developing systems with standardized modules, methodologies, and guidelines for implementing a structured and consistent approach to IT project development. Bureaus and offices that have already developed information life cycle management documents and implemented practices prescribed therein should use this manual as a means to generate thought for process improvement. Bureaus and offices without standardized methodologies should utilize this manual for the management of their systems life cycles. The Department is in the process of identifying additional architecture-related documentation for each of the life cycle phases of major projects. Documentation requirements will be tied to the Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF). Upon finalization, additionally developed documentation will be added to the ISLC.

III.

Information System Life Cycle Model

A lifecycle model may be tailored to the unique needs of an information system project. For example, the use of COTS products in an information system can result in the reduction or elimination of some phases or activities. The tailored process will be described in the project (management) plan. As an example, life cycle tasks and products may be reduced for an information system project to install a COTS software product on an existing bureau IT infrastructure. The project manager should consider the size, complexity, and scope of the information project when preparing the project plan. Some tasks and work products may be omitted as long as the resulting approach provides for the delivery of a quality system. The model outlined in this document includes the following phases: 1. 2. 3. Requirements Identification and Analysis Project Planning Development and Testing

An illustration of the six-phase model described in this document is provided on the next page. Other life cycle models are illustrated in Appendix A-1 through A-4. The models outlined in the appendices are listed as illustrations of system development methodologies that may be used. There are other methodologies that can be used to support the effective development of systems. Bureaus are not precluded from using other tools and techniques and are encouraged to share their best practice methodologies with other bureaus.

1. Requirements Identification and Analysis The initial phase of an information system project is the identification and analysis of the requirements the project must meet. During the requirements identification process, the functional manager(s) should provide the first critical description of the information system requirements or opportunity for improvement and should document the need to secure resources to further examine the requirements, opportunity or potential solution. Once it is determined that an IT investment is necessary to address a bureau's program goals and strategic objectives, an Integrated Project Team should be established to specify and define required functional technical requirements to address strategic objectives. Requirements should address the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Mission function Outsourcing Use of COTS technology or supported reengineered work processes Analysis of alternatives, cost-benefit analysis, estimated return on investment Consistency with target architecture and sequencing plan Risk-reduction criteria Planned approach to development Balanced acquisition strategy Performance measures Workload and related requirements Records management requirements Security requirements Accessibility (Section 508) requirements for individuals with disabilities Quality Assurance Configuration Management Test Management

There are some requirements that should be addressed throughout a system's life cycle, e.g., quality assurance and configuration management. For large or complex projects, a feasibility study and market survey should be conducted to provide a preliminary determination of needs and alternative strategies for meeting those needs. The information derived from the identification and validation of requirements should be used as decision criteria with respect to the evaluation of proposed IT investments. This information becomes an integral part of an IT investment management process as mandated by the Clinger-Cohen Act. An IT investment management process is an integrated approach to managing IT investments that provides for the continuous identification, selection, control, life-cycle management, and evaluation of IT investments. The Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (also known as the Clinger-Cohen Act) , as supplemented by the Capital Programming Guide Supplement to OMB Circular A-11, Part 3, "Planning, Budgeting, and Acquisition of

8

Capital Assets," defines the specific requirements for IT capital planning and investment control and mandates a select/control/evaluate approach. As described in the November 8, 1999 memorandum from the Assistant Secretary for Management, I-TIPS (Information Technology Investment Portfolio System) is a mandatory-use capital planning and management tool for all Treasury capital IT investments for Fiscal Year 2002 and future budget cycles. The Department and bureau staff will use I-TIPS as part of a capital investment management process to select, control, and evaluate IT projects. All proposed capital investments must be justified by supporting documentation. The Department has developed a standard business case template as guidance and encourages Bureaus to use it. The template is provided at http://intranet.cio.treas.gov/cirb/cioc2.nsf/SBCTemplate-OpenPage.htm In the select phase, the costs and benefits of all available projects are assessed and the optimal portfolio of projects is selected. During the control phase, the portfolio is monitored and corrective action is applied where needed. In the evaluate phase, implemented projects are reviewed to assure that they are producing the benefits expected, and adjustments are made where appropriate. All phases may be underway at once as they are applied to projects at different stages of their lifecycle. The IT investment portfolio concept, as set forth in the Clinger-Cohen Act, emphasizes the need for Federal agencies to do a better job of prioritizing IT capital investments and being accountable for results. Appendix B illustrates the components of the select/control/evaluate approach as developed by GAO. Policies, responsibilities and procedures relating to IT investment management processes are outlined in TD P 81-01, Department of the Treasury IT Manual. TD P 81-01 also provides detailed information on requirements identification and cost-benefit analyses. TD P 81-01 is provided at http://intanet.cio.treas.gov/cio/ITManualV4.pdf Section 508 Accessibility standards are provided at http://www.section508.gov A description of functional requirements is outlined in Appendix C-1. A requirements checklist is outlined in Appendix C-2. 2. Planning Planning begins after requirements have been sufficiently identified and validated, the project has been approved, and resources have been allocated, and continues throughout the life cycle of a project. Program developers and management should develop a detailed Project Plan, which indicates the project's work breakdown, schedule, associated resource requirements, and plans for managing quality and risk at the onset of the development phase. Once the Project Plan is approved, day-to-day project work can then be assigned and monitored, and overall performance of the project measured and assessed. During the planning phase, it should be emphasized that a "freeze" will be

9

placed on any changes in requirements requested subsequent to the initiation of the development phase. The Project Plan is a detailed implementation plan developed during the planning phase of the life cycle. It needs to be flexible enough to accommodate re-planning needs as the project progresses. The plan documents the baselines mutually agreed upon by program and project managers, and encompasses all project-planning documents needed to effectively perform and control project activity, including, but not limited to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Project Schedule and Milestones Project Work Plan, including Work Packages Project Resource Plan Project Quality Action Plan Team Organization Chart(s) Project Risk Mitigation Plan Project Assumptions

Program and project management must jointly resolve all baseline differences between the Project Plan and the initial estimates provided by program management. The following information should also be provided as part of the Project Plan: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Assumptions used in preparing the planning documents Methods used in defining, estimating, and scheduling the work Additional project risks identified and, if possible, their projected effect on the baselines Alternative project approaches considered and rejected or warranting further discussion.

Illustrations of a project plan, a planning checklist and a planning review template are provided in Appendix D-1 through D-3. 3. Development and Testing A. Development Various methodologies exist today for application development and software engineering. These methods range from the widely known, such as Structured Design, to hundreds of lesser-known approaches, some supported by a single individual or organization. Combinations of methodologies and software tools play a key role in achieving a higher level of software quality and productivity. Software quality, from requirement analysis to final testing, integration and ultimately production maintenance, can be greatly improved by selecting an appropriate development methodology. In Appendix E, notable methodologies and tools are examined and compared.

The development phase of the system life cycle is the phase in which developers transform requirements into a design that is compliant with the applicable bureau and/or Treasury target architecture and sequencing plan. Guidance on information technology architecture is provided in the Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF). Additional information on TEAF is located at http://www.treas.gov/teaf/. Developers are tasked with creating a detailed design for interfaces that are external and internal to the software item. The following are requirements for the development phase: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Ensure that the software is traceable to the requirements Ensure external consistency of software and requirements Ensure internal consistency among software components Ensure appropriateness of design methodologies Ensure viability of detailed design Ensure viability of operation and maintenance

Testing and quality assurance activities are integral parts of the development phase. B. Testing Testing is the most labor-intensive activity performed during software development. Testing often requires more effort than the combined total for requirements analysis and design by as much as 15%. Testing is also a significant source of risk that is often not recognized until cost and schedule overruns have occurred. Industry experts agree that there are two basic reasons why testing is risky. First, testing traditionally occurs so late in the life cycle model that defects become costly and time consuming to locate and correct. Secondly, the testing methodology employed is frequently inadequate and poorly defined. Many projects enter into the testing phase of the life cycle model without a clear idea of what to accomplish and how to accomplish it. Software testing is a process that checks software execution against requirements. The goal of software testing, in the past, was to demonstrate correctness and quality. Today, this goal has been modified. Testing cannot produce quality software, or verify correctness; rather, testing can only confirm the presence of software defects. Software defects are usually symptoms of fundamental problems in the development process. As a result, software testing has evolved into an integrated set of quality assurance processes that cover the entire development life cycle. To engineer quality software, developers must inspect, test and remove errors from requirements, design, documentation, code, test plans, and tests. Testing is usually divided into various levels: i. Unit Testing

11

A unit is a component and a component is an aggregate of one or more components that can be tested as an aggregate, such as subroutines, functions, macros, the application and the subroutines it calls, communicating routines, or an entire software system. Unit testing is usually performed by the programmers who created the unit. Unit testing is usually conducted in an incremental design/code/test fashion, where more and more of the completed system is progressively tested during each increment. There are two basic types of testing that are performed at the unit and system level: structural testing and behavioral testing. Structural testing ideally involves exhaustive execution of all paths of control flow in a module or system. Exhaustive tests are usually impossible because the number of potential paths can be infinite. Also, path testing cannot detect missing paths or data sensitivity defects. Therefore, structural test case design should be based on random and/or selective testing of control flow. Some structural testing techniques include: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Statement coverage Decision coverage Condition coverage Decision/condition coverage Multiple decision/condition coverage Independent path coverage

Behavioral testing focuses on requirements. Testing should consist of ensuring that the application meets all features mentioned in the specifications and requirements. Behavioral testing is performed without knowledge of how the object tested is constructed and focuses only ensuring the program or module behaves as indicated in the specifications and requirements. In contrast with exhaustive path testing, behavioral testing focuses on exhaustive input testing, which is also usually impossible due to the potentially infinite amount of inputs. Thus, behavioral test case design should be based on random and/or selective testing of inputs. Behavioral testing techniques include: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Equivalence partitioning Boundary analysis Cause effect graphing Error guessing

During the unit test, it is important to note that neither test approach is sufficient alone. Behavioral testing should be used throughout the development process, while structured methods are best used later in the process. Both methods are complimentary, however, some redundancy does exist. To this effect, automated tools that build test cases, which maximize yield and minimize redundancy, may be a sound investment.

12

ii. Subsystem Integration Testing As basic units are integrated into subsystems, even those units that have received adequate unit-level testing may produce failures when used in connection with the other units that comprise the subsystem. Specifications written by component developers do not always describe behavior in sufficient detail to define how the component will interact with every other component. The directed tests are constructed from the interactions between units as specified in the architecture. These representative tests search for those failures that users of the system are mostly likely to encounter. The representative tests are constructed from the use cases used to represent the business process requirements. The integration test plan should describe tests that cover each protocol between pairs of components. A protocol is a complete sequence to messages going back and forth between two components. Each protocol must be consistent with standard input-process-output. Test cases should include instances where the protocol is violated with the expected result that one of the two components will recognize the violation and raise an exception. iii. System Qualification Testing System qualification testing is performed to demonstrate to the customer that system requirements have been met. It covers the system requirements in the system/subsystem specifications and in any associated interface requirements specifications. If a system is developed in multiple modules, qualification testing of the completed system will not occur until the final module is developed. System qualification testing in each module is interpreted to mean planning and performing tests of the current module of the system to ensure that the system requirements implemented in that module have been met. iv. System Acceptance Testing The acceptance test is a formal test that demonstrates to the user that the system meets all specified needs. The criteria for an acceptance test will be used as part of the system test. If a project has passed the system test, then fails an acceptance test, the system testing was seriously inadequate. v. System Security Testing The security test focuses on verification of the protection mechanisms built into the system. It is designed to see how secure the system is from improper penetration and malicious use.

13

vi. Accessibility Testing Accessibility testing provides assurance that design specifications for hardware and software meet accessibility (Section 508) requirements. Section 508 requirements (standards) are provided at: http://www.section508.gov vii. Quality Assurance Quality Assurance (QA) refers to a group of related activities employed throughout the life cycle of a system to quantify and improve the quality of software. It is important to note that the QA process spans the entire life cycle of the system from requirements definition to disposal. Standard QA methodologies and assessment guidelines include ISO 9000 and Capability Maturity Model (CMM)-Based Appraisal for Internal Process Improvement (CBA IPI). The quality of software is assured in the QA process through defect detection practices such as formal inspections, reviews, and testing. QA procedures and policies should be embedded within the software development life cycle. The purpose of these embedded QA procedures is to reduce error rates in system development, which ultimately results in less rework and increased cost savings. QA methods focus on detection and elimination of defects as early in the life cycle as possible. Independent oversight functions can also be a part of the QA process. An independent test function, or testing which is observed by an independent organization, such as a contractor, is another method of assuring quality products. Other options include tests witnessed by users, expert review of test results, and audits of the system being developed. Many methods are used to perform the QA process. Several methods employed by effective organizations today follow: ˇ Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) - Independent verification and validation is a term used to describe a process where an independent group (e.g., contractors) verify and validate the project's adherence to established standards and procedures such as ISO 9000 and CMM. Formal Inspection - Formal inspections are an examination of the completed product of a particular stage in the development process (such as requirements definition or code generation). Formal inspections typically employ checklists and expert inspection teams to determine the quality of the completed product. Reviews - Reviews are applied as an alternative to formal inspections. Informal design and code review methods are difficult to quantify since they are generally completed at the discretion of the project manager. Informal 14

ˇ

ˇ

review is vital if formal inspections are not utilized. Reviews also refer to project meetings (e.g., product design reviews) which have the end effect of evaluating the value of the project. ˇ Walkthroughs - Walkthroughs are meetings in which the developer acts as a presenter to step through the development process in a structured manner. The objective of a walkthrough is often to raise and/or resolve design or implementation issues. Testing - Testing is a technique that has the primary goal of error detection. Testing is conducted first on individual components during intermediate stages of development, subsystems after integration, and the entire software system once systems are deployed

ˇ

Analysis entails addressing process weaknesses that allowed product defects to be manifested. In analysis, processes are analyzed to prevent defects from occurring during development of the system. Common approaches utilized in analysis include root cause analysis and process brainstorming. A team of individuals, which should be comprised of both developers and analysts, determines the root cause of the defect insertion through a comprehensive review of processes utilized in development. If the cause is systemic and/or may be repeated, brainstorming for a remedy is performed to reduce the likelihood of similar defects which could manifest themselves later in the development process. Ideas for process improvement are generated and passed to the project management. Based on the information derived in the process brainstorming session(s), analyses can be performed at various stages throughout the system life cycle. Project management should strive to minimize the elapsed time between defect discovery and analysis. Statistical methods can also be used to assess both process and product quality. These methods include Pareto analysis, Shewart control charts, histograms, and scatter diagrams. These methods will not be discussed in this document, but are named to bring awareness about other statistical models which exist to assist in quality control. Bureaus and offices should also note that if CMM is utilized for project development, quality assurance tools and methodologies are already built into the CMM model. As an agency progresses from CMM level 1 to CMM level 2 and beyond, the ability to generate quality software automatically becomes a part of the development process. The following appendices provide information in the form of plans and checklists that should be considered during the development and testing phase: Appendix F-1: Test Plan

Appendix F-2: Quality Assurance Plan Appendix F-3: Design Checklist Appendix F-4: Development Checklist Appendix F-5: Test Checklist Appendix F-6: Final Design Review Checklist Appendix F-7: Test Readiness Review Checklist Appendix F-8: Test Analysis Review Checklist 4. Implementation The implementation phase focuses on transitioning the assembled from the development phase into a production system for real users. Typically, softwareengineering activities in the development may fail to address certain software design elements and may not address some requirements. Because of this, configuration management plans and training plans should be adhered to and included as integral parts of the overall implementation plan. Quality must be a central focus in this phase of system development. An illustration of an implementation plan is provided in Appendix G. An implementation checklist is provided in Appendix H. A. Training Training encompasses all activities related to ensuring that the users of the system are aware of the system functionality and how to use the system. Training should focus around discussing the transition from the "as-is" to the "to-be" system and the benefits of making the transition. The user manual should be used as the primary mechanism for setting up actual system training. All training activities should be listed in the training plan. Specific details of information to include in a training plan are provided in Appendix I. B. Configuration Management/Change Control Configuration management provides a set of tools and procedures to control changes to a system after life cycle activities have begun and also controls the establishment and maintenance of production, testing, training, and development libraries. Additionally, configuration management provides the functional and physical characteristics of hardware and software as specified in the technical documentation and achieved in the end product. The objectives of configuration management are:

16

ˇ

To provide a method to ensure the functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software are identical as specified in the technical documentation and archived in the end product. To identify and control changes to the functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software and to ensure the proper documentation and maintenance of approved changes in system and application manuals. To establish policy that addresses the development of specifications, test plans, test results and a formal review of test results in order to ensure consistency/uniformity in IT practices and procedures. To ensure that the structured methodology for establishing changes provides adequate controls; e.g., implementing procedures to address the appropriate segregation of duties of requesting, authorizing, programming and testing officials. To establish policy and procedures that ensure the proper retention of specifications, test results, and quality assurance documentation. To provide a structured methodology for monitoring, reviewing and verifying the implementation of configuration changes needed to hardware, firmware, software (operating systems, COTS products, and applications) and telecommunications supporting information technology functions. To provide a method for formal evaluation of the impact of proposed changes to the functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software. To provide reports on the status of the functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software. To establish formal oversight of system changes to maintain an open path of communication for all impacted parties, as well as, to provide routine notification/status of any system changes. To identify, establish, and control the configuration baselines.

ˇ ˇ

ˇ ˇ ˇ

ˇ

Configuration management includes four functions: ˇ ˇ Identification: selecting and labeling all functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software. Control: the evaluation, coordination, approval and implementation of all approved changes to the contents of an established configuration baseline, i.e., the initial functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software. 17

ˇ

Accounting: provides the administrative support required for maintaining system baselines and monitoring the status of the system throughout the life cycle as well as recording and reporting the information that is needed to effectively manage the functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software. Audit: a form of examining the configuration records to verify the success of the change control and identification processes.

ˇ

A configuration management plan template is provided in Appendix J. The template addresses minimum standards for configuration management and should be modified by bureaus as needed. 5. Operation The operation phase focuses on operating and maintaining the newly implemented system that was created in the development phase. The system must meet the formal service targets and metrics established in earlier phases. The team conducting the operations phase must also provide feedback for improvements based on measurements of actual performance against those targets. The goal of the operation phase is the continuous provision of service to achieve and sustain the benefits of the new system. The operations phase is comprised of a service operations phase and an overarching application management practice. The service operations stage focuses on operating the new system and the application management practice entails the management of the underlying application (i.e. technical support). The principles that differentiate the operation phase from the other phases are that: ˇ This phase represents the operation of the new system that was developed and deployed during the development phase, including all related business processes, human performance initiatives, and technology innovations. The focus for all activities is long-term (i.e. several years, instead of weeks or months). Operation does not consist of a series of projects that have a finite life span; operation activities are started once a new system is deployed, and are ongoing. Continuous improvement is used to sustain value. The application management team's standards are raised periodically in order to improve results. This process can achieve a reduction in cost and an increase in value.

ˇ ˇ ˇ

18

The operation phase focuses on outcome, not deliverables. Although there are several deliverables, they are used to support the work in the phase itself (e.g. trouble logs, etc.). The success of the operation phase depends on consistent and improved outcomes. Periodic Information System Evaluation This phase of the life cycle begins when the system is fully operational, and ends when the system is retired from use or terminated. This phase is intended to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Ensure that user needs are met. Ensure that the system continues to perform as specified in the operational environment. Ensure that all other measures are on target. Ensure technical and strategic compliance with the applicable bureau and/or Treasure enterprise architecture. Identify lessons learned from the system development activities as well as operations that may be applied to other systems. Identify improvements in the investment management process.

A number of project approach, project execution, project continuation, and program management decisions are considered and made during the evaluation of an information system. Project approach considerations include: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ What evaluations of the system/data should be conducted? What new or additional user support activities are needed? What improvements in system/data functionality, quality, and/or performance are needed? What improvements or adjustments to the business process are needed? What adjustments to the system/data management approach are needed?

Project execution considerations include: ˇ ˇ What changes/enhancements to the system/database(s) are needed? Should a particular enhancement be implemented during this phase or given its own life cycle?

Project continuation considerations include:

19

ˇ ˇ ˇ

Does the information system requirement continue to exist? Does the production system address the requirement sufficiently to be continued in operation? Are sufficient funding and other resources available for the remainder of the life cycle?

Program management considerations include: ˇ ˇ Are any lessons learned applicable to other current or planned systems? Are any improvements required to the investment management process?

Ultimately, to support these decisions, review activities may occur several times throughout the operating phase. Each time the system is reviewed, one of two decisions is made: either the system is continued in operation (with or without modifications) or the system is terminated, and its functions and data transferred to other systems. A. Post-Implementation Reviews The post-implementation review is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system development after the system has been in production for a period of time. The objectives are to: ˇ Assess the system's effectiveness in meeting the original objectives. ˇ Identify the achieved benefits, assess whether they match projected benefits, and determine the reasons for any discrepancies. ˇ Evaluate whether original business assumptions used to justify the system were valid, and are still valid. ˇ Compare actual costs incurred against projected costs. ˇ Determine how well the project met time schedules and implementation dates. ˇ Evaluate issues that still require management attention. Post-implementation reviews are conducted between three and twelve months after implementation of the system and ensure that the system functions as planned, that benefits are derived, and that the system is within the estimated costs. The bureau may also conduct a user satisfaction review, if deemed appropriate. Users may be defined as the internal users, other external public organizations, or private citizens. Surveys of private citizens must ultimately be approved by the Office of Management and Budget, in concert with requirements specified in the Paperwork Reduction Act, as amended, and OMB implementing regulations. A representative from the functional development group or other member of the major user organization participates in the review. The project sponsor ensures that all documentation needed for the review is preserved and available, and that all personnel needed to participate in the review are accessible.

20

The reviewer and an assigned team collect the information needed for the post-implementation review by interviewing end users and their managers, system administrators, and computer operations personnel. The post-implementation review may be a free-form report and not all sections will be relevant or necessary to the final product. It is the bureau's responsibility to develop, document and initiate the processes and procedures for post implementation reviews. The bureau must also determine the appropriate report format and questions. Descriptive information of post-implementation reviews is provided in Appendix K. B. Periodic System Reviews A Periodic System Review is a continuous system review. It is performed to evaluate system performance, user satisfaction with the system, adaptability to changing business needs, and new technologies that might improve the system. A periodic system review is diagnostic in nature and can lead to development or maintenance activities. Any major system modifications needed after the system has been implemented will follow the life cycle process from planning through implementation. A project plan, including feasibility study, will identify modification to existing system documentation (change pages) rather than new system documentation (e.g., functional requirements document, internal design document, etc.). The appropriate reviews and testing will be conducted, based on the scope of the modification. Post Implementation Reviews and Periodic System Reviews are very similar in nature to the reviews that must be conducted during the system development phases, particularly to support decision milestones. Periodic System Reviews are conducted every three years, and as long as the system is in operation (continuously) to ensure that system performance is optimized and that users are satisfied with the system. Regardless of specific evaluations, all systems require normal maintenance activities to ensure that any previously undetected errors are fixed. Maintenance may take several forms: ˇ Taking advantage of hardware upgrades or new releases of system software and application software packages used to operate the system (e.g., upgrades and releases). Identifying potential modifications needed to ensure that the system continues to operate as intended and produces quality data. Identifying modifications to the system and database(s) are needed to resolve errors or performance problems, or to provide new capabilities. New capabilities may take the form of routine maintenance, or may constitute enhancements to the system or database(s) that respond to user request for

ˇ ˇ

21

new/improved capabilities. The maintenance manual is used and updated accordingly. C. Investment Management Process Project reviews are pivotal to an organization's investment management process. The review provides an assessment of the system to the Investment Review Board or designated oversight group. Deliverables may also be produced for the benefit of other management officials. Besides being a feedback mechanism about a specific system, these reviews are a critical feedback mechanism on the effectiveness of an organization's investment management process. Ultimately, for these reviews to be effective, the organization must ensure that the necessary methodologies, processes and mechanisms are not only functional but also effectively employed. The following issues and questions should be addressed when developing required process, mechanisms and methodologies: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Reviews and resulting conclusions/recommendations are to be communicated to, and reviewed by, senior management. Review reports and results should be tracked and centrally maintained. Aggregate results are of particular interest to senior management. Trend analysis of the review reports and results can be informative. The organization can ensure compliance with recommendations and decisions. Specific roles and responsibilities are delineated. The purpose of the reviews are clearly communicated, since problems may be identified.

6. Termination/Disposition Disposition of an information system occurs at the end of the system life cycle. Disposal procedures ensure the orderly termination of a system and preserve vital information about the system in the event the system, or portions of the system (including deliverables) would need to be re-instituted. A disposition plan is prepared to address all facets of archiving, transferring and disposing of the system and the data. It is important to ensure proper preservation of the data processed by the system so that the data is effectively migrated into another system (conversion) or archived in accordance with applicable records management regulations and policies for potential future access. Disposal procedures preserve information not only about the current production system, but also about the evolution of the system through its life cycle. A number of project approach, project execution and project continuation decisions are made during the disposal of a system.

22

Project approach decisions include: what evaluations of the system/data should be conducted to determine the need for a new system to replace the functionality of the old system; what new or additional user support activities are needed (if any); what improvements in system/data functionality quality, and/or performance are needed (if the old system is being replaced by a new system and not just being phased out); and what adjustments to the system/data management approach are needed (i.e. application of lessons learned from implementation of the old system). Project execution decisions include: what changes/enhancements to the system/database(s) are needed, should a particular enhancement be implemented or an existing system completely replaced? Project continuation decisions include: does the information system requirement continue to exist, does the production system address the requirement sufficiently to be continued in operation, and are sufficient funding and other resources available for the remainder of the life cycle? Additional decisions to consider at the end of the system life include: what will be the system termination date, which software components should be preserved, which data should be preserved, what should be done with remaining equipment, and how should life cycle products be archived? A. Disposition Plan The disposition plan is critical to ensure proper disposition of the information system. The plan will vary according to system and bureau requirements. The objectives of the plan are to end the operation or the system in a planned, orderly manner and to ensure that system components and data are properly archived or incorporated into other systems. At the end of this task, the system will no longer exist as an independent entity. The completion of the system life cycle is carefully planned and documented to avoid disruption of the organizations using the system, or of other systems that will use the data and/or software of the present system. The software, hardware, and data of the current system are disposed of in accordance with organizational needs and pertinent laws and regulations. Software or data of the system may be transferred to other existing systems, migrated to an entirely new system, or saved and stored for future use. Hardware is made available for future use, added to surplus, or discarded. In conducting the disposition task, several items are to be considered: ˇ All known users should be informed of the decision to terminate operation of the system before the actual termination date.

23

ˇ

Although the current system may be terminated, in many cases the data will continue to be used through other systems. The specific processing logic used to transfer the data to another system is developed as part of the data conversion planning for that system. In some instances, software may be transferred to a replacement system. For example, a component of the current system may become a component of the replacement system without significant rewriting of programs. Effective reactivation of the system in the future will depend heavily on having complete documentation. It is generally advisable to save and store all documentation, including the life cycle products generated during the earliest tasks of the life cycle as well as the documentation for users and for operation and maintenance personnel.

ˇ

ˇ

The disposition plan addresses how the various components of the system are handled at the completion of operations, including software, data, hardware, communications, and documentation. The plan also notes any future access to the system. The plan is lead/performed by the project manager, supported by the Records Officer, the project team and the functional staff, and reviewed by the quality assurance manager. Other tasks include the following: ˇ Notify users of termination date. Notify all known users of the system date of the planned date after which the system will no longer be available. Work with the FOIA/PA representative to process any Federal Register regarding system of records notification. Store or transfer data. Copy data to be saved onto permanent storage media, and store media in location designated by the disposition plan. Work with the project management team for other systems to effect a smooth transfer of data from current system to these systems. Store or transfer software components. Copy software onto permanent storage media, and store media in location designated in disposition plan. (Software to be stored may include communications and systems software as well as application software.) Work with the project team for other systems to ensure effective migration of current system software to be used by these systems. Save life cycle products. Store other life cycle products, including system documentation, in archive locations designated by the disposition plan. Dispose of remaining equipment. Dispose of equipment used exclusively by this system in accordance with the disposition plan (refer to excess procedures).

Appendix A ­ Life Cycle Models Waterfall Model Appendix A-1

The Waterfall Model can be thought of as the traditional development model. In the earliest days of software development, code was written and then debugged, repeatedly. As complex systems began to evolve, the code and debug approach became less than optimal. To deal with the problems introduced by development of large, complex systems, the Waterfall model was created. The Waterfall model is an approach to development that emphasizes completion of a given phase of software development before proceeding to the next phase. Transition from phase to phase is accomplished by holding a formal review that is attended by the developers, including contractors (if utilized) and appropriate government representatives. These reviews provide insight into the progress of the software development. Deliverable documents are reviewed at the end of each phase and serve as a baseline for the subsequent phases. If the need for change is identified, a formal change process is followed to implement these changes. In the Waterfall model, phases do not overlap, which makes the model straightforward and relatively simple to understand. When to use the Waterfall model: The Waterfall model, though easy to understand, fails to recognize the complexities and constantly changing requirements in software development. The Waterfall model may be appropriate for use on small system development projects and on some legacy system maintenance. Strengths of the Waterfall model include: ˇ A formal method, built on a firm foundation of rigor, planning, extensive and standardized documentation, analysis, review and change controls ˇ A top-down model that encourages analysis and documentation before coding begins ˇ It is composed of independent phases to be completed sequentially and has well defined entry and exit conditions for each phase ˇ It has well defined major milestones and review requirements ˇ It specifies requirements (both content and format) for all significant planning documents and document products encourage consistency Weaknesses of the Waterfall Model include: ˇ A complete set of requirements is required at the onset ˇ Enforcement of non-implementation attitude hampers analyst/designer communications

Spiral Model (Boehm Spiral Model)

Appendix A-2

The Spiral model encompasses the best features of both the traditional Waterfall life cycle model and prototyping, while also including a risk analysis element. In the Spiral model, prototyping is used up front with later introduction of the Waterfall model accompanied by increased resources when the risks have been minimized. The increase in resources is seen in the increased distance between the coils of the spiral shown in the diagram below. In the Spiral model, the entire system is not initially defined in detail. The project developers define the highest priority features first. The knowledge and experience from the first iteration is used to continue to define and implement additional features in smaller steps. The Spiral model software development method is elaborated in a series of repetitive steps, which are represented by the progression of the spiral through the project development. Each spiral increases the scope of the project and adds functionality. The complexity of systems is addressed in the initial iterations. Four quadrants that make up the Spiral model as the system goes through its development life cycle: ˇ Planning - determine objectives, alternatives and constraints ˇ Risk Analysis - identify and resolve risks, evaluate alternatives ˇ Engineering - develop deliverables for the iteration and verify that they are correct ˇ Customer Evaluation - assessment of engineering, plan the next iteration The Spiral model is a risk-oriented software life cycle. Each level addresses major risks that have been identified. Based on risk-resolution results, the project eliminates uncompromising product and process alternatives, and refines the best products. The best products and processes are reviewed and the project proceeds to the next level of the spiral. After all risks have been addressed, the spiral model terminates as a Waterfall life cycle model. Strengths of the Spiral model include: ˇ Emphasizes quality ˇ Emphasizes risk reduction techniques, such as prototyping, simulations, and buy vs. build ˇ Provides checkpoints for consideration of project cancellation ˇ Avoids the difficulties of existing software models through risk-driven approach ˇ Attempts to eliminate errors in early phases ˇ Provides one model for software development and maintenance ˇ Provides mechanisms for software quality assurance ˇ Applicable to other kinds of projects (e.g. hardware) ˇ Re-evaluation after each phase allows for changes in user perspectives, technology advances, or finances Some weaknesses of the Spiral model include: ˇ Full-scale risk analysis requires training, skills, and considerable expense ˇ Lack of explicit process guidance in determining objectives, constraints, and alternatives 28

When to use the Spiral model: The Spiral model is particularly well suited for large projects due to their inherent high level of risk. The model should also be utilized in the development of applications for which success is not guaranteed or where applications could require large amounts of computations (e.g. decision support systems). Boehm Spiral Model (Boehm)

Incremental Model

Appendix A-3

The Incremental model performs the phases from the Waterfall model in overlapping sections in an attempt to compensate for the length of Waterfall model projects by producing usable functionality earlier. The process may entail creation of a set of requirements up front that are implemented in a series of smaller projects. Because module completion can occur at differing times, well-defined interfaces are required. In the Incremental model, formal audits and reviews become more difficult to implement than is the case when using a complete system approach. Management must also be careful of a tendency to push difficult problems into the future to demonstrate early success. When to use the Incremental Model: The Incremental model should be used when bureaus or offices determine that there are too many risks to developing an entire system at once. The Incremental model is similar to the spiral model in that it strives to minimize risks by breaking up a large product into separate phases, which are completed at differing times while still retaining some of the structured characteristics of the waterfall model. Incremental Model

Requirement Design Implementation Requirement Design Requirement Design Implementation

Implementation Source: USAF STSC The Department of the Treasury recommends utilization of the Incremental and Spiral models for very large, risky systems development projects that involve extensive customization. While the Incremental and Spiral model can be applied to COTS software 30

The term COTS describes ready-made products that are created by commercial vendors for licensing and sale to multiple customers. Support for these products is available through the software manufacturer and/or various third party sources. Quality COTS products have the following characteristics: few defects, significant and broad customer base, adherence to a specified standard, and the ability to be tailored by the user (e.g. utilizing Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) for customization of Microsoft Office products). COTS entails a wide variety of products ranging from plug and play components like Microsoft Office to customizable, enterprise-wide business applications such as PeopleSoft, SAP and other Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. Because COTS encompasses a broad range of software systems, there is no clearly defined, industry-accepted standard for the COTS implementation. Generally, software vendors and implementers will utilize their own COTS development methodologies, based on best practices. As package-based application solutions mature and become more robust, they have become attractive to organizations for a variety of reasons. Many organizations have found that the use of COTS products can result in a significant savings of money and time on the application development process since the vendor has already borne the development costs. The decision to implement COTS products is driven by several factors to include: ˇ Expense and risk to complete custom software development on-time and within budget ˇ Growing availability of enterprise-wide packaged business applications ˇ Articles in mainstream press demonstrating the cost effectiveness of COTS products Currently, many bureaus and offices have implemented, or are developing new systems utilizing COTS software. While none of the traditional life cycle models address all the issues presented by COTS applications, the United States Customs Service (USCS) has developed a COTS life cycle that can serve as a general model for bureaus within the Department. The Customs COTS model utilizes a compressed waterfall methodology to provide a structured approach for implementation of COTS solutions. This methodology assumes that COTS products would provide the following benefits: ˇ COTS products would reduce the development costs and overall schedule ˇ The development life cycle would be accelerated ˇ Feasibility demonstrations could be put together quickly ˇ End product quality would be higher ˇ COTS vendors will provide maintenance for their COTS products While the assumptions listed above are can be true with regards to COTS implementation, experience in implementing COTS products has also shown that the following considerations should also be taken into account: ˇ Accelerated development catapults organizations immediately into detailed requirements definition, integration assessments and test planning/design.

Although the Customs development model is robust and encompasses numerous check points and deliverables to ensure quality of development, it is not ideally suited to smaller organizations which are not capable of providing the necessary manpower and resources to implement COTS solutions using a structured compressed waterfall methodology. COTS software integration changes the emphasis in the classic waterfall life cycle stages of planning, definition, analysis, design, construction, integration and test, implementation, deployment and maintenance. COTS based development differs from customized application development in that the COTS selection process must occur early in the life cycle. COTS evaluation and selection becomes a critical part of the earlier analysis process because the infrastructure will ultimately consist of COTS products that must be compatible. The COTS development method must be tailored to accommodate the unique aspects of COTS product integration. These modifications to a standard development methodology necessitate a set of assumptions and constraints that differ from those of custom-built development methodologies. Specific considerations by stage are outlined in the following paragraphs. The front-end processes in the definition and analysis stage must support concurrent requirements and a thorough evaluation and analysis of and product selection of available COTS products. This analysis prototype in the functional design state must provide for iteration and a flexible link between COTS product evaluations and requirements gap assessments and the feedback loop to requirements analysis. One example of the changes in the classic cycle available in a COTS program is in the specific confirmation of requirements definitions. COTS product final requirements are often defined in a "Conference Room Pilot" hands on environment. This exercise is often possible due to the availability of a noncustomized generic version of the COTS system for early use in requirements definition and refinement. A actual operational model of the COTS system is often available to aid in the confirmation of systems requirements. During implementation of COTS products, development activities take on a dual nature. One process path is the actual implementation of the existing COTS product in an organization's existing architecture, and the other is development of customized code that integrates COTS products and fills in missing functionality that is not available in the package solution. COTS product implementation may also entail tuning and configuration of interfaces and threads between components in a multi-COTS environment. Traditional software maintenance activities must be expanded in scope and extended to provide continuing COTS product support. Maintenance support starts early in the development lifecycle of COTS products. COTS implementation developers must have early deliveries of any new COTS releases and training for any partially completed infrastructure functionality to keep within an accelerated development time cycle. Configuration controls are just as critical in COTS development as in traditional programs and must be organized and set in place early to accommodate multiple versions of COTS products and configuration files. Separate environments for development and integration

35

must be well defined and structured to accept delivered COTS products. Early support for multiple baselines must be in place as the combinations of multiple COTS products may become complex. Additional COTS Considerations The following considerations are provided for reference and are derived from industry best practices in implementing COTS products: ˇ COTS products integrators do not develop the COTS product, but still must have deep skill and knowledge of the products they are integrating. The integrator must understand the complete set of capabilities provided by the COTS product and understand the limitations and nuances of the COTS product ˇ System administrators and configuration management staff need to know how to configure COTS products, not just developers ˇ Configuration files and data must be understood by system administrators and configuration managers ˇ Ensure that Release notes (installation guidelines, operational parameters, tuning guidelines, etc.) and site configuration guidelines (guidelines to assist site designers choose hardware and software suites and rules for scaling and resource allocation) are available ­ these documents are not usually included in normal development life cycles ˇ Version compatibility between COTS products, operating systems, and custom developed "glue code" is critical and must be carefully tracked before revisions to any components of complex multi component COTS environments are "upgraded" ˇ Licensing adds a dimension of complexity and needs to be worked with early. Issues include the number and type of licenses required for the environment. Procurement of production licenses within government agencies can require a long lead time Infrastructure Incremental Development Approach (IIDA) COTS software may require little or no formal coding by the strict definition used by custom developers, however, extensive "configuration" and "tailoring" may be required and should be carefully evaluated. COTS also often require significant integration with other components. This necessitates recasting the design, construction, and integration and test developing stages to accommodate early COTS software integration and testing. Interface software, configuration files, scripts, utilities, and data files are required to make the COTS software deliver its intended functionality. The proper development and testing of these interfaces could potentially become a complex process depending on the COTS product implemented. Another approach to developing COTS applications is the Infrastructure Incremental Development Approach (IIDA). The IIDA is a tailored life cycle that preserves the benefit of existing structured processes for software development, while adapting to the particular characteristics of integrating COTS products. The IIDA model, shown below in Figure 9 is a combination of the Waterfall and Spiral development models, but places emphasis on establishing compatibility and completeness rather than on component level specifications.

36

IIDA model

Source: USAF STSC The IIDA model is an iterative and incremental approach to development. The target infrastructure is the long-term vision for the application. It is defined and subsequently refined during the Definitions and Analysis stage through a top-down process of analysis of enterprise requirements, adopted standards, and system architecture. The Technical Strategies component captures the high-level description of the application vision and defines how the infrastructure will operate. The Services Identification component is built up over time and can be influenced by technology trends, product assessments, and anticpated needs of applications. Development cycle stages are augmented with a series of structured prototypes for COTS product evaluation and integration. For each COTS product, the prototypes evolve from initial analysis demos for a make-or-buy decision to a series of design prototypes for COTS product selection and detailed requirements assesment. A demonstration prototype often becomes part of the development test bed. The following is a summary of the IIDA stages: Definitions and Analysis Stage: ˇ Enterprise requirements and standards, system architecutre, and technical strategies are defined and refined. COTS working prototypes and other installed baselines are often utilized for requirements evaluation and definition. ˇ Version specific functional infrastructure requirements are established by considering business application areas, architectural imperitives, and technology availability Functional Design Stage

37

ˇ ˇ ˇ

Services included in the target and current versions are identified and defined "AS IS" and "TO BE" business processes are identified early based on the increased availability of this information with a COTS program. This information is used to refine requirements and confirm the functional and infrastructure design. Prototypes/ Conference room pilots are used to identify leading candidate COTS components

Physical Design Stage ˇ Interfaces between applications and infrastructure are defined ˇ Internal design of services is defined both functionally and technically ˇ COTS and to-be-built components are identified ˇ Prototypes are used to select and characterize COTS components ˇ Preliminary bill of materials is created for acquisition of equipment and COTS software products ˇ Design is calibrated for scaling and performance considerations to provide site designers with site configuration guidelines ˇ Structure of each to-be-built component and its interfaces is defined Construction Stage ˇ To-be-built components are constructed ˇ Glue-code is developed, and the unit is tested ˇ COTS components, glue-code, and built components are integrated into the infrastructure using the demonstration prototype as a test bed ˇ Test Stage Infrastructure versions are tested prior to being integrated and tested with business applications When to use COTS: Use of COTS software products often significantly decrease the cost of system development, however, emphasis should be placed on the key factors that influence a COTS implementation decision. When considering COTS, bureaus and offices should ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements for and business need for the software system prior to beginning the project. There are a wide variety of ready-made COTS software applications that can be purchased to meet an even wider variety of government business needs. While COTS implementations do reduce procurement, development, and support costs, they also require a stricter conformance to "industry best practices" in the implemented business processes supported by that COTS product. The organization supported must fully understand and be supportive of any potential new business processes associated with the COTS. Excessive modification of a COTS package in support of any required business process changes brings with it the increased costs and maintenance risks. To take full advantage of a COTS solution this balance of COTS and business process must be understood. 38

Once requirements and needs are initially defined, agencies should research the vendors that provide packaged COTS software solutions that could meet the agencies requirements and needs. A formal detailed analysis of the requirements and software products should be conducted to determine what options (build or buy) would best suit the agency. Agencies should apply the principles of sound management to ensure that their COTS selection best addresses the fiscal, functional and architectural requirements, and risks of the agency.

Functional Requirements Document

Appendix C-1

The functional requirements document serves as the foundation for system (i.e., hardware and software) design and development. It captures user requirements to be implemented in a new or enhanced system. The systems subject matter experts document the requirements into the requirement traceability matrix, which shows the mapping of each detailed functional requirement to its source. Hardware must be addressed early to ensure there is sufficient information to make decisions on: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ How date is entered for processing, i.e., PC keyboard, scanning, file transfer. How output is delivered, i.e., PC screen, print, disk, etc. General input/output to decide mainframe vs. client-server or combination. General customer access via LAN and/or WAN. Query, storage, archival, backup and retrieval of data. Preliminary funding for hardware purchases and budgeting for maintenance.

If required for analysis, a general description of the business policies and functions to be supported by the system is provided. This description may be independent of the way that the functions are currently carried out. If the intent is to automate existing functional processes exactly, then the existing processes should be described. Some areas of the outline may not be applicable to the system under development and can be excluded or marked, "Not Applicable." 1.

Security Requirements Provide a description of security and privacy requirements. The presence of the following factors may indicate that the system has areas of security concerns: ˇ Privacy Act considerations ˇ Proprietary information to be handled by the system ˇ Computer Security Act considerations ˇ Financial systems which authorize funds allocations or funds flows that are based on electronic signatures or passwords ˇ Specific risks related to the system and its processing environment ˇ C2 requirements for sensitive, but unclassified systems 44

Address risks from theft, disclosure, unauthorized access, eavesdropping, programmed attacks, mis-routing, misplacement, erasure and accidental damage considerations. Security requirements are further defined when completing the system security and integrity requirements worksheets in the risk assessment plan and the requirements are also cross-referenced in the contingency plan as appropriate. Address the security requirements outlined in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) memorandum titled, "Incorporating and Funding Security in Information Systems Investments," dated February 28, 2000. Those requirements state that investments in the development of new or the continued operation of existing information systems, both general support systems and major applications, proposed for funding in the President's budget must: A. Be tied to the agency's information architecture. Proposals should demonstrate that the security controls for components, applications, and systems are consistent with and an integral part of the information technology architecture of the agency. B. Be well planned by: i. Demonstrating that the costs of security controls are understood and are explicitly incorporated in the life cycle planning of the overall system in a manner consistent with OMB guidance for capital planning. ii. Incorporating a security plan that discusses: ˇ ˇ ˇ The rules of behavior for the system and the consequences for violating those rules; Personnel and technical controls for the system Methods for identifying, appropriately limiting, and controlling interconnections with other systems and specific ways such limits will be monitored and managed; Procedures for the on-going training of individuals that are permitted access to the system; Procedures for the on-going monitoring of the effectiveness of security controls; 45

ˇ ˇ

ˇ

Procedures for reporting and sharing with appropriate agency and government authorities indications of attempted and successful intrusions into agency systems; and Provisions for the continuity of support in the event of system disruption or failure.

ˇ

C. Manage risks by: i. Demonstrating specific methods used to ensure that risks and potential for loss are understood and continually assessed, that steps are taken to maintain risk at an acceptable level, and that procedures are in place to ensure that controls are implemented effectively and remain effective over time. ii. Demonstrating specific methods used to ensure that the security controls are commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm that may result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the system itself or the information it manages. iii. Identifying additional security controls that are necessary to minimize risks to and potential loss from those systems that promote or permit public access, other externally accessible systems, and those systems that are interconnected with systems over which program officials have little or no control D. Protect privacy and confidentiality by: i. Deploying effective security controls and authentication tools consistent with the protection of privacy, such as public-key based digital signatures, for those systems that promote or permit public access. ii. Ensuring that the handling of personal information is consistent with relevant government-wide and agency policies, such as privacy statements on the agency's web sites. E. Account for departures from National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Guidance.

46

i. For non-national security applications, to ensure the use of risk-based cost-effective security controls, describe each occasion when employing standards and guidance that are more stringent than those promulgated by NIST. 7. Quality Assurance For each quality factor, the system developer should provide a brief explanation of its importance. The system developer works with the user to identify the most appropriate quality factors. In addition, for each quality factor not selected, provide a brief explanation for not selecting that quality factor. For example, for a particular financial system the correctness and integrity quality factors may be important to ensure that the system is implemented as specified and to prevent theft of data that could lead to financial fraud. For the same financial system, the verifiability quality factor may also be important to verify the system's performance. If the bureau's development staff expect to reuse certain system functions in future systems, then the reusability quality factor would be important. In addition, other quality factors might be applicable, depending on the system to be developed. Therefore the most important quality factors would be selected for developing the system. All members involved in creating the FRD should consider the following fifteen quality factors when determining and documenting the system requirements. By selecting and referring to these quality factors, FRD developers may begin to document expectations and standards that will facilitate the development of a high quality system. The following quality factors can apply to any system: ˇ Correctness. Extent to which all specified functions are implemented, the design is documented according to standards, and the software's performance is within the criteria set for Performance. ˇ Requirements in the FRD. What was produced was specified; and what was specified was produced ˇ Efficiency. The resources needed to provide the required functionality are affordable. ˇ Expandability. Enhancing the software's functionality or performance is easy. ˇ Flexibility. Modifying the software for different environments requires little more than a user interface or change of data, without resorting to expandability-type changes. ˇ Integrity. Assurance that the software and data are not being tampered with or stolen and that the software is performing updates appropriately.

47

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

ˇ ˇ ˇ

ˇ

Interoperability. The software can be easily coupled with other systems, and the results will comply with industry standards. Maintainability. Finding and fixing errors is sufficiently easy to allow production to continue, even with the issuance of new releases. Manageability. Administrative aspects of software modification are facilitated by tools such as configuration control systems, source code libraries, and media control procedures. Portability. The ability of software of a system to run on more than one type or size of computer or under more than one operating system. Usability. System is user-friendly; documentation is thorough and accurate; and few keystrokes are required per command. The implemented system fulfills its functional purposes as determined by its users. Reliability. Prevention of inaccurate results, slow response, system "freezes" (stops without recovery), and system failures. Reusability. Portions of the software can be used for other applications, as a result of the availability of a large library for standard software building blocks. Survivability. Although a system failure may cause a degraded functionality, the user can still execute essential functions of the software (for example, a spreadsheet can be calculated even though the printer is not functioning). Verifiability. Verification of the software's specified performance is simple.

If a privacy plan is more suitable, cross-reference this section with a plan. It is important that there be a preliminary analysis of the potential privacy impacts of the proposed information system. The purpose will be to establish for the project team and the review process an awareness of the privacy related issues that will have to be addressed as the system is planned, developed, and implemented v. Computer Security Activities. Review and evaluate risk assessment results and owner's evaluation of sensitivity of information and systems to determine if all system vulnerabilities, threats, risks, and privacy issues have been identified and whether an accurate determination has been made of the sensitivity of the system and information. L. Human Resource and System Design Strategy. If the project creates major changes to the existing work force, a plan is developed with the human resources office to address work force planning. 4. Risk Areas and Control Measures Describe any risk areas for the project. If known, describe risks that might affect the ability to complete the project on schedule and within budget. Identify factors that contribute to these risks. Examples of such factors are the use of new computer hardware or software technology, uncertainty in the ability to define user functional requirements adequately, and a compressed development schedule. Address approaches for mitigating the impacts of these

ˇ

57

factors. Add subsections as necessary to separate different categories of risk or different risk-inducing factors. 5. Work Breakdown Structures The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a family tree structure that relates to products produced and tasks performed at the various phases of the project life cycle. The typical WBS products may consist of hardware products, services and life cycle products. A WBS displays and defines the product(s) to be developed or produced, and relates the elements of work (tasks) to be accomplished to each other and to the end product(s). Typically, the three types of WBSs developed during the system development process are: summary, project, and contract. A. Summary Work Breakdown Structure. The Summary WBS is a high-level WBS that covers the first three levels of the Project WBS. The summary WBS is used for management presentations, but is not used for detailed day-to-day project management. The structure of the Summary WBS may vary depending on the nature of the project. B. Project Work Breakdown Structure. The Project WBS is the detailed WBS that is used for the day-to-day management of a project. The Project WBS includes all important products and work elements, or tasks, of the project, regardless of whether these tasks are performed by the bureau or a contractor. The Project WBS may be modified, if necessary, during the life cycle. For a software system development project, the structure of the Project WBS should also reflect the bureau's life cycle approach. The structure of the Project WBS may vary depending on the nature of the project, and should be customized by the bureau's project manager to reflect the particular project and the particular path through the life cycle. For example, a full-scale initial information system development project and a software conversion process would be expected to have somewhat different WBS. Similarly, the Project WBS for an information system development project with a major hardware complement would differ from a software-only project. C. Contract Work Breakdown Structure. The Contract WBS (CWBS) is a further breakdown of the contract specific WBS that covers the products and work elements, or tasks, from Project WBS to be performed by a contractor. In addition to items derived from the Project WBS, the CWBS will have contractor specific items which may not reflected in the Project WBS. Depending on the nature of the project, the contractor may be responsible for a given part of the project development activities (for example, quality assurance), for a specific part of

58

the development life cycle (for example, requirements definition), or for the entire development process. A preliminary CWBS is usually specified by the bureau in the Acquisition Plan. The contract line items, configuration items, contract work statement tasks, contract specification, and contractor responses will typically be expressed in terms of the preliminary CWBS.

Methodologies and Tools 1. Rapid Application Development (RAD)

Appendix E

RAD is a concept that products can be developed faster and of higher quality through: ˇ Gathering requirements using workshops or focus groups ˇ Prototyping and early, reiterative user testing of designs ˇ A rigidly paced schedule that defers design improvements to the next product version RAD usually embraces object-oriented programming methodology, which inherently fosters software re-use. The most popular object-oriented programming languages, C++ and Java, are offered in visual programming packages often described as providing rapid application development. 2. Prototyping The prototyping method takes a customer's general objectives rather than a detailed set of requirements as a starting point. The first prototype is then produced quickly and submitted to the customer for evaluation. Evaluation leads to a refinement of requirements, which are then implemented rapidly. When the customer is satisfied, the final product is engineered either from the final prototype (evolutionary prototyping) or from scratch (revolutionary prototyping). Prototyping is often employed in conjunction with the waterfall approaches as a means to define and verify user requirements throughout the life cycle. Prototyping is used to develop a quick implementation of the software prior to or during the software requirements phase. The customer uses the prototype and provides feedback to the software developers regarding its perceived strengths and weaknesses. This feedback is used to refine or change the prototype to meet the real needs of the customer. Prototyping

65

Source: USAF STSC The Prototyping methodology has several strengths: ˇ Misunderstandings of requirements are found early (e.g. help communications between user and developer with different backgrounds) ˇ User interface may be refined to customer's requirements (e.g. Windows may be standard in customer's organization) ˇ The feasibility of the system may be demonstrated (e.g. developer may be breaking new ground) ˇ User training may start before delivery ˇ Risks and costs may be reduced in development ˇ The user has ongoing input to the process Weaknesses of the Prototyping include: ˇ Prototyping is not suitable for system that require extensive customization ˇ Prototyping requires deep software development experience with the products that are being prototyped There are two strategies that may be used to execute the Prototyping methodology which are the "evolutionary" and the "revolutionary" strategies. The "evolutionary" strategy also develops a system in builds but differs from the incremental strategy in that it acknowledges that the user need is not fully understood and all requirements cannot be defined up front. In this strategy, user needs and system requirements are partially defined up front, then are refined in each subsequent build. The evolutionary strategy offers two variations: incremental release and iterative enhancement. The "revolutionary" strategy also develops a system in builds and acknowledges that the user need is not fully understood and all requirements cannot be defined up front. Like the evolutionary strategy, user needs and system requirements are partially defined up front, and then are refined in each subsequent build. The major difference between the two strategies is that in the revolutionary strategy, each build is eliminated and replaced entirely with the subsequent build. 3. Joint Application Development (JAD) Joint Application Development (JAD) is an approach to systems analysis and design introduced by IBM in 1977 that emphasizes teamwork between user and technician. Small groups meet to determine system objectives and the business transactions to be supported. A neutral facilitator who can move the group toward well-defined goals runs the groups. Results include a prototype of the proposed system. As JAD embodies the concept of getting as much participation in the design process as possible from actual users the end product is likely to incorporate their stated desires. 66

Additionally, interested parties aside from the end users are invited to participate in the design process. These individuals often provide important third party insights. 4. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Object-oriented programming is a revolutionary new way of looking at computer programming. Historically, programs have been viewed as procedures (or we may think of these as "verbs") that operate on data. OOP takes the view that programs should start by thinking about the data (or "nouns") first. After all, the primary purpose of computing is the result, not the computing procedure itself. By using data modeling concepts and techniques, a programmer can identify data objects and their relationships. A generalization of a data object along with its possible data variables and methods (what to do with the variables) is defined as a Class of data objects. Some of the ideas and advantages of OOP include: ˇ The concept of a data class makes it possible to define subclasses of data objects that share some or all of the main class characteristics. Called inheritance, this property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time, and ensures more accurate coding Data hiding is possible because an object and its methods will know only about the data they need to know about. Because other objects and methods in the application program cannot be accessed without rewriting the object, the possibilities of accidental or unintended data corruption that are possible in procedural programs are not possible with OOP The definition of a class is reusable not only by the program for which it is initially created but also by other object-oriented programs (and, for this reason, can be more easily distributed for use in networks) The concept of data classes allows a programmer to create new data types that are not defined in the language itself

ˇ

ˇ ˇ

Examples of Object Oriented Programming languages include C++, Java, and Visual Basic. 5. Reuse Methodology Reuse is using code developed for one application program in another application, traditionally achieved using program libraries. Object-oriented programming offers reusability of code through its qualities of inheritance and generality. Class libraries with intelligent browsers and application generators are under development to simplify this process. An organization's strategy for adopting a reuse technology should be based on a vision for improving the organization's way of doing business. Due to situational factors, such as budget, schedule, and the business environment, an organization's actual reuse performance may not reflect its capability. Accordingly, these factors 67

should be taken into consideration when selecting an improvement strategy. It is not necessarily true that the proper business decision is to improve an organization's reuse capability to the highest extent possible as it may not be worth the investment in the given business environment. Bureaus should consider reuse in the context of their overall IT strategies. 6. Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) CASE is the use of a computer-assisted method to organize and control the development of software, especially on large, complex projects involving many software components and people. Using CASE allows designers, code writers, testers, planners, and managers to share a common view of where a project stands at each stage of development. CASE helps ensure a disciplined, check-pointed process. A CASE tool may portray progress (or lack of it) graphically. It may also serve as a repository for or be linked to document and program libraries containing the project's business plans, design requirements, design specifications, detailed code specifications, the code units, test cases and results, and marketing and service plans. CASE originated in the 1970s when computer companies were beginning to borrow ideas from the hardware manufacturing process and apply them to software development (which generally has been viewed as an insufficiently disciplined process). Some CASE tools supported the concepts of structured programming and similar organized development methods. More recently, CASE tools have had to encompass or accommodate visual programming tools and object-oriented programming. In organizations, a CASE tool may be part of a spectrum of processes designed to ensure quality in what is developed. (Many organizations have their processes audited and certified as being in conformance with the ISO 9000 standard.) By making the customer part of the process through market analysis and focus groups, for example, a CASE product is more likely to meet real-world requirements. Because the development process emphasizes testing and redesign, the cost of servicing a product over its lifetime can be reduced considerably. An organized approach to development encourages code and design reuse, reducing costs and improving quality.

Test Plan

Appendix F-1

The purpose of the test plan is to ensure that all aspects of the system are adequately tested and that the system can be successfully implemented. The test plan documents the scope, content, methodology, sequence, management of and responsibilities for test activities. The test plan describes the test activities of: unit/module test, subsystem integration test, system qualification test, system acceptance test, and security test in progressively higher levels of detail as the system is developed. The test plan provides guidance for the management of test activities, including organization, relationships, and responsibilities. The test case procedures may be included in the test plan or in a separate document, depending on system size. The project user assist in developing the test plan which describes the nature and extent of tests deemed necessary. This provides a basis for verification of unit tests and validation of the system. The validation process ensures that the system conforms to the functional requirements in the functional requirements document and that other applications or subsystems are not adversely impacted. Test analysis reports are developed at each level of testing to record the results of testing and certify readiness for system implementation (see test phase). Problems, deficiencies, modifications, and refinements identified during testing or implementation should be tracked under configuration control and tested using the same test procedures as those described in the test plan. Specific tests may need to be added to the plan at that time, and other documentation may need updating upon implementation, as well. Notification of implemented changes to the initiator of the change request/problem report and to the users of the system is also handled as part of the configuration control process. A modified system acceptance test, including the users of the system, should be performed before such changes are implemented. 1. Introduction Provide an overview and background on the application(s) system being tested. Do not provide information at this level of heading, if the description provided in the subsections is sufficient. A. Purpose. Identify the application system being tested by name and describe the purpose of the test plan. Include a summary of the functions of the system and the tests to be performed. B. Background. Provide a brief description of the history and other background leading up to the system development process. Identify user organization and location where the testing will be performed. Describe any prior testing and note results that may affect this testing. C. Scope. Describe the boundaries of the planned tests. Include a summary of any constraints imposed on the testing whether they are due to a lack of specialized test equipment, or constraints on time or resources. Describe constraints in greater detail in the "Limitations" section below. 69

D. Project References. List publications and documents referenced in the test plan. Include any referenced standards the application is expected to meet and also describe the application being tested in greater detail. The referenced documents are listed as project documents, Government documents, and non-Government documents. Add additional headings for clarity if needed. E. Project Documents. List the project documents that were developed prior to the test plan. Examples may include the project plan, acquisition plan, cost-benefit analysis, functional requirements document, etc. In addition to project documents, documents from related projects may also be referenced. F. Government Documents. List any applicable Government standards, policies, directives, circulars, and other documents that apply to the test plan and the conduct of testing. G. Non-Government Documents. List any non-Government documents, such as industry standards or reference documents, that may apply to the test plan and to the conduct of testing. H. Glossary. Provide a list of all terms and abbreviations used in this document. If the list is several pages in length, it may be placed as an appendix. 2. Limitations and Trace-ability Elaborate on the limitations of the constraints as summarized in the Scope required above. Cross-reference the functional requirements and detailed specifications to the tests that demonstrate or partially demonstrate that capability. A. Limitations. Describe constraints imposed on the testing, whether they are due to lack of specialized test equipment or constraints on time or resources. Indicate what steps, if any, are being taken to reduce the program risk due to the test limitation(s). B. Trace-ability. Enhance the trace-ability matrix created in the FRD to include testing activities which address user requirements. This matrix begins with the user requirements and assists in tracing how the requirements are addressed in subsequent phases and documents, including the external/internal design documents and test plans. The matrix may be broken up into segments, if appropriate. For example, a separate matrix of the test plan paragraphs that trace to particular paragraphs in the internal design document in the design phase may be provided. The intent is to show that the test design tests all of the functionality, performance, and other requirements associated with each design element (unit, module, subsystem, and system) in the internal design document.

70

When a test supports a particular requirement, the relationship is noted at their intersection in the matrix. The listed requirements may be explicitly stated, or may be derived or implicit. All explicit requirements must be included. The granularity of the list should be detailed enough that each requirement is simple and testable. 3. Test Plans Describe the levels of tests that take place during development: unit, integration, and system level tests, and the planning that is needed. The test environment is described in terms of milestones, schedules, and resources needed to support testing. a. Test Levels. In the test plan, list the various types of software testing below. i. Unit/Module Test. This level of testing is generally conducted by the individual who develops the code. The test validates the module's logic, adherence to functional requirements and adherence to technical specifications. The goal of this test is to ensure that all module source statements have been executed and each conditional branch taken. The test and their results are recorded in the software development folder for that module. The folder includes the source code for the module, a clean compiled listing of the code, a list of any outstanding issues or problems in the design or the program discovered during the supervised module desk check review, the test data sets, copies of any output, and the rationale for design decisions. The software development folders containing the test data may be delivered in the final test plan or in an appendix. ii. Subsystem Integration Test. This test examines the subsystems that are made up of integrated groupings of software units and modules. This level of testing is generally performed by the developing organization and is generally conducted in the development environment. It is also generally the first level of testing where problem reports are generated, classified by severity, and their resolution monitored and reported. The subsystem integration test results, including the test data sets and outputs produced from the tests may be delivered as part of the final test plan, with the integration test analysis report, or in an appendix. iii. System Qualification Test. This independent test determines whether the system complies with standards and satisfies functional and technical requirements when executed on target hardware using operational data files 71

and user prepared test data. System documents and training manuals are tested for accuracy, validity, completeness, and usability. During this test, the software performance, response time, and ability to operate under stressed conditions will be tested. External system interfaces are also tested. All findings are recorded in a system qualification test analysis report. iv. System Acceptance Test. This test is performed in an environment which "mirrors" the environment in which the system will be fielded. The environment is a nonproduction environment. Every feature of the system may be tested for correctness and conformance to functional requirements. System interoperability, all documentation, system reliability, and the level to which the system meets user requirements will be evaluated. Performance tests may be executed to ensure that screen response time, program run time, operator intervention requirements and overall system operations meet user requirements. Recovery and restart procedures may be evaluated. Interfaces to other applications should be tested here as well. The tests results, including the test data sets and outputs produced from the tests may be delivered as part of the final test plan, with the system acceptance test analysis report, or in an appendix. v. Security Test. This test is performed in the operational (production) environment under the guidance of the security staff. This test evaluates compliance with system security and integrity guidelines. System backup, recovery, security, audit trails, and reconciliation issues are addressed. Include internal controls or application security features mentioned in the context of security testing. b. Test Environment and Schedules. Document key elements of the test environment, including milestones, schedule, and resource requirements in this section. i. Software Description. Provide a brief description of the inputs, outputs, and functions of the software being tested. ii. Milestones. List the milestone events, and dates for the testing. iii. Organizations and Locations. Identify the participating organizations and the location where the software will be tested. iv. Schedule. Show the detailed schedule of dates and events for the testing by location. Such events may include familiarization, training, test data set generation and 72

collection, as well as the volume and frequency of the input for testing. Resource Requirements. State the resource requirements including the following: Equipment - show the expected period of use, types, and quantities of equipment needed Software - list other software that will be needed to support the testing that is not part of the software to be tested. This can include debugging software and programming aid, as well as many current programs to be run in parallel with the new software to ensure accuracy; any drivers or system software to be used in conjunction with the new software to ensure compatibility and integration; and any software required to operate the equipment and record test results Personnel - list the numbers, skill types, and schedules for personnel that are expected during the test from both the user, database, quality assurance, security and development groups. Include any special requirements such as multi-shift operation or key personnel.

ix. Testing Material. List the materials needed for the test, such as documentation, software to be tested and its medium, test inputs, sample outputs, test control software, and worksheets. x. Test Training. Describe or reference the plan for providing training in the use of the software being tested. Specify the types of training, personnel to be trained, and the training staff. c. Test Methods and Evaluation. Document the test methodologies, conditions, test progression or sequencing, data recording, constraints, criteria, and data reduction in this section. i. Methodology. Describe the general methodology or strategy of the testing for each type of testing described in this test plan. ii. Conditions. Specify the type of input to be used, such as realtime entered test data, canned data for batch runs, and so on. Describe the volume and frequency of the input, such as the number of transaction per second tested and so on. Sufficient volumes of test transactions should be used to simulate live stress testing at each level, and to incorporate a wide range of valid and invalid conditions. Data values used should simulate live data and also test limited conditions. iii. Test Progression. Describe the manner in which progression is made from one test to another so that the entire cycle is completed.

73

iv. Data Recording. Describe the method to be used for recording the test results and other information about the testing. v. Constraints. Indicate anticipated limitations on the test due to test conditions, such as interfaces, equipment, personnel, and databases. vi. Criteria. Describe the rules to be used to evaluate test results, such as range of data values used, combinations of input types used, maximum number of allowable interrupts or halts. vii. Data Reduction. Describe the techniques to be used for manipulating the test data into a form suitable for evaluation, such as manual or automated methods, to allow comparison of the results that should be produced to those that are produced. 4. Test Description Describe each test to be performed in this section. Tests at each level should include verification of access control and system standards, data security, functionality, and error processing. As various levels of testing (unit/module, subsystem integration, system qualification, system acceptance testing, and security) are completed and the test results are documented, revisions or increments of the test plan can be delivered. The subsections of this section should be repeated for each test within the project. If there is a large number of tests, they can be placed as an appendix. a. Test Name. Identify the test to be performed for the named unit, module, subsystem or system. Address the following for each test: i. Test Description. Describe the test to be performed. Tests at each level of testing should include those designed to verify data security, access control and system standards, system/subsystem/unit functionality, and error processing as required. ii. Control. Describe the test control, such as manual, semiautomatic, or automatic insertion of inputs, sequencing of operations, and recording of results. iii. Inputs. Describe the data input commands used during the test. Provide listings of input data. At the discretion of the bureau software manager, input data listings may also be requested in computer readable form - for possible future use in regression testing. iv. Outputs. Describe the output data expected as a result of the test and any intermediate messages or display screens that may be produced. v. Procedures. Specify the step-by-step procedures to accomplish the test. Include test setup, initialization, steps

74

and termination. Also include effectiveness criteria or pass criteria for each test procedure.

Quality Assurance Plan

Appendix F-2

The purpose of the quality assurance plan is to indicate the means by which the quality assurance (QA) requirements established for a system development effort will be met. The degree of QA applied and the level of detail contained in the QA plan should be appropriately tailored to and consistent with the complexity, size, intended use, missioncriticality, and cost of failure of the system development effort. 1. General a. Purpose. Identify the specific purpose and scope of the quality assurance (QA) plan. Name and briefly describe the project addressed by the QA plan. b. Reference.

Configuration Management Plan Template

Appendix J

The purpose of the configuration management (CM) plan is to establish uniform CM practices to manage the establishment of and changes to the system hardware and software. The plan identifies the physical location of system baselines; the locations in which hard copy documentation is stored; and the automated libraries used to store other documentation and the software components of the system. CM helps maintain the integrity of the system throughout its life cycle and facilitates communication about the system among project team members, users, and other supporting organizations. CM guidelines are applied through the systematic identification, control, and audit of system characteristics. They include the following: ˇ Configuration identification of functional and physical characteristics of a system through structured documentation baselines ˇ Configuration control of changes to the physical and functional characteristics of hardware and software systems and baseline documentation describing them ˇ Configuration status accounting about the current configuration and changes to it ˇ Configuration audits to verify that system performance and configuration are accurately identified in the baseline documentation ˇ Storage and control of access to the baseline documentation, source code, and executable code. A baseline is a documented technical description that becomes a reference point against which changes can be proposed, evaluated, and incorporated. 1. General Identify the specific purpose and scope of the CM plan. Name and briefly describe the project covered by the CM plan. Include the name of the configuration manager for the system who will be responsible for establishing and maintaining the configuration management records for the system. In addition, include plans to establish the change control board. The change control board examines requested changes to the system, direct the change request impact analysis and, based on the results, determine the changes that are to be made and those that are not to be made to the system. 2. Configuration Identification Cite the project documents that identify and define the configuration baseline characteristics. Identify the following: ˇ Documentation that establishes the selected system baseline ˇ Documentation and media defining code and documentation that are placed under configuration control, and the corresponding version, release, and change status of each deliverable item; and ˇ System components comprising the application system, to the module level.

109

Configuration identification serves to clearly delineate the significant characteristics of the system, providing a common language, or referencing scheme, for describing the system. It is the delineation of specific configuration items that will enable all individuals involved in the evolution of the system to communicate effectively, using the common language. Examples of such characteristics include specific functional and data requirements, specific characteristics of the system design and system documentation. 3. Configuration Control Identify approval/disapproval authority for changes, library controls, and the librarian used for the project. In addition, procedures for controlling the preparation and dissemination of changes to deliverable software and documentation that have been placed under configuration control. Specific change control and software control procedures are covered in detail. Change control is a process for determining what changes are to be made to the system. Change control requires the documentation of specific requests for modifications, and a review of the requested modifications, and consideration of their impact on the system, before they are made. Change control is implemented through a Configuration Control Board (CCB). The membership of a CCB consists of the stakeholders of the IT infrastructure. Software control is a set of procedures to ensure that the integrity of the system is preserved when approved changes are being made to the system, or in the event of a disaster and restoration of the system is needed. Software control procedures are particularly important during the operation phase of the life cycle. Software control ensures that changes to the computer programs are developed and tested using a copy of the programs and test database, and do not adversely affect system users. However software control is also important during the development and implementation phases to control changes during the planning and installation of the system. 4. Configuration Accounting State the procedures for generating documentation that will provide trace-ability of changes to controlled products and communicate the status of configuration items to management. Identify data content and format of accounting records, and their frequency and distribution. Configuration accounting is an administrative procedure for maintaining system baselines and monitoring the status of the system throughout the life cycle. The configuration accounting procedure

110

may also include documentation for use by the project team throughout the life cycle. 5. Configuration Audits State the procedures for preparation and execution of audits for establishing the trace-ability of requirements identified for the project. The procedures identify what will be certified and provided to management for approval. Configuration audits are examinations of the products and related documents submitted for inclusion in a baseline to assure that they are complete, clearly presented, and internally consistent. This examination is oriented to adherence to guidance and standards. These audits support reviews and evaluations of the system by ensuring that required products and documents are complete and provide effective trace-ability to related products. Audits do not evaluate qualitatively the programmatic and/or technical content of the product. This is done by other reviews and other quality assurance activities. Audits help ensure that the resources used to conduct reviews and evaluations are not applied to products that are not yet ready for the review. A. Functional Configuration Audit (FCA). Describe the point at which an FCA will be completed and the process to be followed. An FCA is a means of validating that the developer (contractor) has completed the system in accordance with the requirements definition. The FCA ensures that technical documentation and test analysis/reports accurately reflect the functional, operational, and performance characteristics specified. B. Physical Configuration Audit (PCA). Describe the point at which a PCA will be completed and the process that will be followed. The PCA is a means for validating the system baseline. The PCA ensures that configuration items are developed as specified in the design documents; that the items are tested, verified and/or validated successfully and that any differences are resolved. 6. Problem Reporting and Corrective Action Describe the procedures for reporting, prioritizing, tracking, and resolving problems that result from reviews, audits, and tests. 7. Tools, Techniques, and Methodologies Identify the automated tools, techniques, and methodologies to be used to support configuration management.

                                   ATTACHMENT 17-  CONDITIONAL ACCESS TO SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION


                                                             NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT



I, ______________________, hereby consent to the terms in this Agreement in consideration of my  being  granted  conditional  access  to  certain
United States Government documents or material containing sensitive but unclassified information.

I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions:

      1.    By being granted conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information,  the  United  States  Government  has  placed  special
           confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure, in accordance with the
           terms of this Agreement.

      2.    As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is any information, the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to  or
           unauthorized disclosure or modification of which could adversely affect the national interest or  the  conduct  of  Federal  programs
           including information covered by 18 U.S.C. ââ 1905 and 1906, or the proprietary interests of national banks or their customers or the
           privacy to which individuals are entitled under Title 5 U.S.C. â 552a, but which has not been specifically authorized under  criteria
           established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.

      3.    I am being granted conditional access contingent upon my execution of this Agreement for the sole purpose  of  work  performed  under
           Contract #______________.  This approval will permit me conditional access to certain information,  including  but  not  limited  to,
           documents, memoranda, reports and/or to attend meetings in which such information is discussed or otherwise  made  available  to  me.
           This Agreement will not allow me access to materials which the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) has predetermined, in  its  sole
           discretion, is inappropriate for disclosure pursuant to this Agreement.  This may  include  sensitive  but  unclassified  information
           provided to the Treasury by other agencies of the United States Government.

      4.    I will never divulge any sensitive but unclassified information which is provided to me pursuant to this  Agreement  to  any  person,
           unless I have been advised in writing by the Treasury that the individual is authorized to receive it.  Unless  expressly  authorized
           by the Treasury, I will not use any sensitive but unclassified information for any commercial or other purpose other  than  that  for
           which access to such information is provided under Contract # _______________.    I agree that I  must  seek  and  obtain  the  prior
           written approval of the Treasury for any proposed disclosure or use.

           Additionally, I will submit to the Treasury for security review, prior to any submission for publication, any book,  article,  column
           or other written work for general publication that is based upon any knowledge I obtained during the course of my work on Contract  #
           _______________ in order for the TREASURY to ensure that no sensitive but unclassified information is disclosed.

      5.    I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result  or  may
           result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of sensitive but unclassified information not consistent  with  the  terms  of
           this Agreement.

      6.    If I am permitted, at the sole discretion of the Treasury, to review any official documents  containing  sensitive  but  unclassified
           information, such review will be conducted at a secure facility or under circumstances which will maintain the security protection of
           such material.  I will not be permitted to and will not make any copies of documents or  parts  of  documents  to  which  conditional
           access is granted to me.  Any notes taken during the course of such access will remain at the Treasury to be placed in secure storage
           unless it is determined by Treasury officials that the notes contain no sensitive but unclassified information.  If I  wish  to  have
           the notes released to me, Treasury officials will  review  the  notes  for  purposes  of  deleting  any  sensitive  but  unclassified
           information to create a redacted copy of the notes.  If I do not wish a review of any notes that I  make,  those  notes  will  remain
           sealed in secure storage at the Treasury.

      7.    If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I understand that the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive but  unclassified
           information could compromise the mission and security of the Treasury.

      8.    If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my  conditional  access  to
           sensitive but unclassified information.  This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to  Treasury  information,  both
           classified and sensitive but unclassified, in the future. If I violate the terms and conditions  of  this     Agreement,  the  United
           States may institute a civil action for damages or any other appropriate relief.  The willful disclosure of information  to  which  I
           have agreed therein not to divulge may constitute a criminal offense.

      9.    Unless and until I am provided a written release by the Treasury from this Agreement or  any  portions  of  it,  all  conditions  and
           obligations contained in this Agreement apply both during my period of conditional access, which shall terminate at the conclusion of
           my work on Contract #                      , and at all times thereafter.

      10.   Each provision of this Agreement is severable.  If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other
           provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

      11.   I understand that the United States Government may seek any remedy available to it to enforce  this  Agreement,  including,  but  not
           limited to, application for a court order prohibiting use or disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement.

      12.   By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government does not waive any statutory or common
           law evidentiary privileges or protections that it may assert in any administrative or court proceedings to protect any sensitive  but
           unclassified information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement.

      13.   These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with , or otherwise alter the employee obligations,  rights  or
           liabilities created by Executive order 12356; Section 7211 of Title 5,  United  States  Code  (governing  disclosures  to  Congress);
           Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the  Military  Whistleblower  Protection  Act  (governing  disclosure  to
           Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the  Whistleblower  Protection
           Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health  and  safety  threats);  the  Intelligence  Identities
           Protection Act of 1982 (50 U.S.C. 421 et seq.)(governing disclosures that could  expose  confidential  Government  agents),  and  the
           statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798,  and  952
           of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the  Subversive  Activities  Act  of  1950  (50  U.S.C.  Section  783(b)).   The
           definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions and liabilities created by the Executive  Order  and  listed  statutes  are
           incorporated into this Agreement and are controlling.

      14.   My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or nondisclosure Agreement  which  I  have
           executed or may execute with the United States Government.

      15.   I make this Agreement in good faith, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.

                                                            PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT



1.    INTRODUCTION


The United States Department of the Treasury, hereafter referred to as “Treasury” or “the Government”, has a continuing  requirement  to  improve
and optimize the delivery and maintenance of application development services  to  the  Treasury  Departmental  Offices,  Bureaus,  and  business
partners to meet its on-going and evolving business needs.  The attachments listed in the Solicitation document  provide  background  information
essential to understanding the breadth of this requirement.


1.1   DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY MISSION


The mission of Treasury is to promote the conditions for prosperity and stability in the U.S. and to encourage prosperity and  stability  in  the
rest of the world.  The Treasury Department is organized into two major components, the Departmental Offices  and  the  ten  (10)  Bureaus.   The
Departmental Offices (DO) are primarily responsible for policy formulation, while the bureaus are primarily operating organizations that  execute
many of the Treasury’s goals.


1.2   OFFICE OF THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER


Within the Departmental Offices and under the purview of the Assistant Secretary for Management is the Office of the  Chief  Information  Officer
(OCIO).  The OCIO provides leadership to Treasury and its Bureaus  in  all  areas  of  information  and  technology  management.   OCIO  supports
Treasury's mission by implementing strategies that improve the efficiency and performance of Treasury information  technology  (IT)  systems  and
business processes.  OCIO has department-wide responsibility for the direction and development  of  Treasury’s  IT  strategy,  management  of  IT
investments, and leadership of key technology initiatives.

The Associate CIO for Infrastructure Operations (ACIO-IO)  provides  Treasury-wide  management  and  operation  of  infrastructure  services  and
solutions.

The Departmental Offices IT Strategy is undergoing a transformation to better  align  with  the  evolving  user  requirements  and  the  Treasury
mission.  The DO IT leadership and the Treasury OCIO have developed the following goals and objectives, and key strategies as guiding  principles
for this transformation.  The ASSC contractor is expected to be a major contributor to achieving this transformation, working alongside other  DO
contractors, under the leadership of the OCIO and the DO IT organization.

Overarching Goals/Objectives:
    • Improve Performance
    o Greater functionality for DO employees
    o Increased ease of use and system availability
    o Greater information security
    o Increased timeliness of service to market
    • Maximize Cost Efficiency
    o Reduce unit cost per user for basic IT
    o Reduce cost to deploy and maintain DO applications
    o Increase re-investment from legacy systems into new functionality/capability
Key Strategies:
    • Maximize Standardization
    • Web Enable all applications/functionality
    • Acquire computing resources as a service rather than on a per box basis
    o Move public web sites to Cloud Computing offerings
    o Buy computing power in increments of service rather by the box
    • Leverage new and innovative methods of service delivery to include:
    o Virtualization on servers and desktops
    o Cloud Computing to the maximum extent practicable
    o Use Infrastructure as a Service, Software as a Service, and Storage as a Service
    o Maximize use of services over custom development
    • Employ open source software where practical
    • Implement additional Security measures
    o PIV cards for access in conjunction with an “identity broker/manager” to enable single sign-on access to DO applications
    o Document tagging and DLP to control where data goes and how it is used
    • Implement ITIL-style Service Catalog
    • Include Performance Assessment mechanisms as an integral part of the strategy
    o Establish performance metrics, measurement techniques, and reporting frequency
    • Support External partner application & data services leveraging security services
    • Optimize ease of authorized client information access and manipulation


1.3   ASSC PROGRAM GOALS AND OBJECTIVES


The OCIO requires contractor support services to a) ensure continued reliability and availability of existing  application  systems,  b)  deliver
new application systems, and c) enhance existing systems within Departmental Offices (DO) and Treasury-wide.

Using next-generation enterprise application technologies and  methodologies,  the  contractor  shall  take  advantage  of  emerging  technology,
enabling the department to adjust to new and changing business requirements within the federal operating environment.  Contractor is expected  to
utilize their expertise to recommend enhancement, replacement, or consolidation of existing applications and/or  infrastructure  in  response  to
changes in technology or federal guidelines.  The contractor shall support future Treasury IT requirements for converged  technologies,  IP-based
desktop video/audio conferencing, electronic collaboration, data mining and warehousing.  Accordingly, the contractor is expected to support  the
OCIO goals and objectives to include the following:

    □ Enable Business Case supported growth in application solutions across Treasury.  The solutions must be cost-effective and  efficient,  with
      the goal of enabling use of these applications and solutions by other Government organizations.


    □ Employ performance-based methods for highly reliable and dependable applications and application  support  services  that  meet  or  exceed
      customer expectations and the performance measures and metrics.


    □ Provide effective, efficient, and interactive management information  systems  (MIS)  that  provide  comprehensive,  accurate,  and  timely
      information at program and operational levels, while ensuring the security and content protection of Treasury’s information assets.


    □ Ensure that the application services support Treasury’s compliance with  e-Government  initiatives  and  Government  standards  and  policy
      requirements outlined in Clinger-Cohen Act, Treasury Enterprise Architecture (EA), and Federal and Treasury security policies.


    □ Ensure that the transition to the next-generation application/hosting infrastructure is seamless  and  transparent  to  the  users  without
      disruption of existing services.


    □ Pursue enhanced user satisfaction, while mission critical, traditional business  solutions  and  daily  activities  are  supported  through
      predefined service levels, governance, and IT management processes.


1.4   SCOPE


The general scope of work that may be ordered during the term of the contract comprises three essential elements: technology,  support  services,
and resource management.  The technology and services offered must be in line with the future needs and requirements of the  Government  and  the
Treasury lines of business.  The ASSC solutions will facilitate growth and expansion, while allowing for maximum flexibility within the  program.


Treasury’s information technology must meet current service needs and support the eventual convergence of  Treasury’s  architecture,  information
protection, and capital investment processes.  The ASSC contractor shall provide secure and resilient services that support established  Treasury
disaster recovery plans.  The ASSC contractor shall support customer-centric activities such as content management, transaction  processing,  and
information distribution for collaboration and decision support.  All support services shall be designed  to  simplify  the  customer’s  business
processes with easy-to-use solutions.

shelf (COTS) software and hardware purchased by the Vendor during the execution or performance of this contract shall belong  to  the  government
and will be transferred over at the conclusion of the contract.

The existing applications reside on hardware systems located at three main locations.   These  are  the  Main  Treasury  building,  a  commercial
hosting center in Sterling, VA, and a back up hosting center in Denver, CO.

DO recently awarded a new contract to provide managed services for its IT infrastructure, the Treasury DO IT IMS contract.   This  contract  will
modernize and transform the exiting IT infrastructure of DO.  An integral part of this modernization  effort  involves  the  re-location  of  the
current DO Data Center residing in Main Treasury to the Information Technology Infrastructure Managed Services (IT IMS) contractor’s Data  Center
 located in Herndon, VA.  This relocation effort will require active participation by the ASSC contractor.

5.2.2 Disincentives
The performance period for disincentives is monthly.  For each month that service lacks required performance, a deduction shall be  taken.   Even
though the performance is tracked on a monthly basis, the timeframe against which the calculations are  made  to  determine  if  the  performance
targets are met, exceeded, or missed will be the entire Quarter (Jan-March, April-June, July-Sept., and Oct-Dec).

The Incentives and Disincentives Plan establishes the actual disincentives applied against quarterly performance that are  reviewed  monthly  and
assessed on a quarterly basis.  Regular reporting and tracking of disincentives shall be  done  as  part  of  the  Contractor’s  Monthly  Program
Management Report submitted in accordance with the requirements of Section 4.0 Deliverables.  Disincentives are applied to the  Firm-fixed  Price
portion of the next Monthly invoice following the Quarterly assessment.  At the end of the quarter the Performance Review Board  shall  determine
the disposition of the disincentives  using  the  data,  analysis  and  Contractor’s  performance  during  the  entire  performance  period.  The
determination of the Performance Review Board shall be considered as final.

5.2.3 Incentives
The government will pool any disincentives assessed in a given performance assessment quarter, and provide the contractor with a chance  to  earn
the disincentive back during the quarter immediately following it.  In order to earn the incentive, the contractor shall meet  all  AQLs  on  all
three SLA groups, and exceed the AQLs in those specific SLA  metrics  marked  for  incentive  in  the  following  table.   This  shall  apply  to
contractor’s actual performance during the quarter immediately following that in which a disincentive was assessed.  If the contractor does  earn
back any disincentives in the form of an incentive as described above, the contractor  shall  include  the  dollar  amount  associated  with  the
incentive in the monthly invoice immediately following the quarter in which the determination was made.

The contractor can also “bank” incentive performance achieved in a given performance quarter exactly as defined  above,  to  offset  against  any
future disincentives that may be incurred in upcoming quarters.  However, this “banking” of  incentives  shall  only  be  valid  within  a  given
contract year (base or option year). Furthermore, any incentives earned (banked) applies only against disincentives  that  would  otherwise  have
been incurred during that same quarter. In other words, if the contractor has earned incentives that exceed the amount  of  disincentives,  these
would not be applied until such time as they are needed. Regardless, the government will not pay any “banked” incentives that are  in  excess  of
any total disincentives assessed against the contractor in a given year. At the end of a contract period, any “banked” incentives that  have  not
been offset due to a disincentive will be null and void, and the process will start over again with the exercise of the new contract  period.  In
the case of “banking” incentives, the dollar amount of the incentive will not be reflected in any monthly invoice until such time when  there  is
a disincentive.  The incentives shall only be used to offset disincentives, past or future.

Sample Task Order

Time & Materials 

1.0	Background 

This Task Order performance work statement is issued under the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Application Support Services Contract (ASSC).  The contractor shall analyze, engineer, develop, and implement a web-enabled public facing application in support of the Department of the Treasury’s mission to provide services under the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).  The contractor shall develop the web-enabled public facing application that takes advantage of the Treasury’s existing HSPD-12 and PKI credentialing program for logical access to the application.

An addendum to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) created the Widget Industry Loan Program (Widget Act) in April 2009 to assist US based manufacturers and retailers associated with the ecological/environmental production of widgets.  Through this program, the Department of Treasury will make loans available to qualified widget manufacturing companies.  The government loans will be administered through 20 regional and urban center based banks. The loans will be made in increments, with successive installments made based upon progress toward the company’s return to profitability and viability, as proposed by the company in its loan application. The Treasury Department is tasked by this legislation to oversee the implementation and management of Widget Act.  

The Treasury OCIO’s Headquarters IT (HQIT) organization is responsible for the development, implementation, and maintenance of a web-enabled public facing application system to monitor the Banks in the Widget Act program.  The web application will allow the banks to:

provide a profile of the individual loans issued to Treasury; 

provide quarterly loan re-payment reporting; and 

provide Report of Compliance in Loan Obligations relative to the company’s progress in meeting Return to Profitability Goals to demonstrate merits for granting additional loan installments. 



This multi-phased effort, shall be developed and installed over a 9 month period following a two month requirements and planning phase, followed by development and testing phase, and implementation, reporting, and maintenance phase.  

Phase I – Requirements and planning

Phase II – Development and Testing

Quality level

(AQL)





AQL is the minimum acceptable service level measure that does not violate the

service metric defined in the Service Level Agreement.



Acceptance

Formal agreement that an IT Service, Process, Plan, or other Deliverable is complete,

accurate, Reliable and meets its specified Requirements. Acceptance is usually

preceded by Evaluation or Testing and is often required before proceeding to the

next stage of a Project or Process.



Access

Management



The process responsible for allowing users to make use of IT services, data, or other

assets. Access management helps to protect the confidentiality, integrity and

availability of assets by ensuring that only authorized users are able to access or

modify the assets. Access Management is sometimes referred to as Rights

Management or Identity Management.

Active

Monitoring



Monitoring of a configuration item (CI) or an IT service that uses automated regular

checks to discover the current status.



Adaptive Maintenance

Change to a system, after delivery, to keep it functioning properly in a changed or changing system, technical or business environments. Includes minor enhancements to existing design patterns and the existing application solution framework to keep the system viable in production to meet customer requirements. 

Also includes modifications mandated in response to laws or regulations that govern programs and support for changing business requirements within scope of the original business case. These modifications result in hardware or software changes and/or updates to the system within an organization’s technical architecture that are approved by the Enterprise Architecture Program.

Alert

A warning that a threshold has been reached, something has changed, or a Failure

has occurred. Alerts are often created and managed by System Management tools

and are managed by the Event Management Process.



Application

Software that provides Functions that are required by an IT Service. Each

Application may be part of more than one IT Service. An Application runs on one or

more Servers or Clients.



Application Information System Security

Policy, tools, and guidance designed to secure information contained in an IT application.

Application Software

Is computer software designed to help a user perform a particular task.  Typical examples are word processors, spreadsheets, databases, media players, etc.

Application Software Maintenance

Is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt the product to a modified environment.

Access Control and Authentication

Is a system which enables an authority to control access to areas and resources in a given physical facility (physical access)) or computer-based information system (logical access)  . An access control system, within the field of physical security, is generally seen as the second layer in the security of a physical structure.

Access control is, in reality, an everyday phenomenon. For example, a userid and password to log on to a network or a pin  on an ATM system at a bank is another means of access control. The possession of access control is of prime importance when persons seek to secure important, confidential, or sensitive information and equipment.

Application/System Performance Reviews/Capacity Planning

The process and procedures established by an IT organization to review application performance indicators and establishing/planning thresholds for how large an application/database can be or how fast an IT application/database can run or perform.

Assessment

See Certification, Assessment.



Authentication

Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it is declared to be. In private and public computer networks (including the Internet), authentication is commonly done through the use of logon passwords. Knowledge of the password is assumed to guarantee that the user is authentic. Each user registers initially (or is registered by someone else), using an assigned or self-declared password. On each subsequent use, the user must know and use the previously declared password. The weakness in this system for transactions that are significant (such as the exchange of money) is that passwords can often be stolen, accidentally revealed, or forgotten.
