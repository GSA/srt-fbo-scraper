1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requires all service providers to have an information se curity program that provides management, operational, and technical safeguards designed to protect OCC data. This publication is based on security control requirements established by Federal Information Process ing Standard (FIPS) Publication 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems." Once completed, this self assessment will be analyzed by OCC information Risk Management personnel to provide the OCC's contracting officer with a preliminary assessment of the respondents' security program. OCC's analysis will rely on the quality and completeness of the information provided. OCC Risk Management person nel will conduct further analyses, review, and testing of the apparent winning bidder's security control environment based on a full set of control requirements. Explanation of terms, concepts, and other items related to federal information security requirements can be found in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section of this publication.

4. Frequently Asked Questions
(1)  Why does the OCC require its service providers to complete this self assessment questionnaire? (5)  How does the government define "security control"? The E-Government Act of 2002 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directives require that all information systems that process government information maintain adequate security. "Adequate security" is commensurate with the harm that would result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of information. Adequate security ensures that systems and applications operate effectively and provide appropriate measures of confidentiality, integrity, and availability through the use of managerial, operational, and technical security controls. This requirement applies to all information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the government, including those provided or managed by another government agency, contractor, or other source. (2)  What does "information security" mean? "Information security" is protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. (3)  What does "information system" mean? An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, transmission, and dissemination of information, in accordance with defined procedures, whether automated or manual. (4)  What do the terms "confidentiality, integrity and availability" mean? The OCC's information security controls are based on Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 200. Security controls are the management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a system and its information. Management controls focus on the management of risk and the management of information system security. Operational controls are those safeguards that are primarily implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). Technical controls are primarily implemented and executed by an information system through mechanisms in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system. (6)  What is FIPS 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems," and where can I find more information about it?

That publication is a mandatory standard (it cannot be waived) developed in response to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. The combination of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 establishes the foundation for most federal information security practices and procedures. (7)  What is NIST Special Publication (SP) 80053, Revision II, "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems," December 2007 and where can I find more information on it?

Confidentiality is preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. Integrity is protecting information from improper modification or destruction, and includes ensuring that information is authentic and reliable. Availability is ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.

That publication provides guidelines for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government. These guidelines apply to all components of an information system that process, store, or transmit federal information. The publication provides guidance to federal agencies implementing FIPS 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems."

What are the standards and guides used to create this preliminary self-assessment?

This questionnaire is derived from FIPS publication 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems." (9)  Can a service provider obtain the standards and guides?

NIST information security-related publications can be obtained free of charge from the NIST public Web site located at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/index.html.

SECTION B:  SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES / COSTS

   1. GENERAL

In accordance with this contract, the Contractor shall furnish all materials, labor, equipment and facilities, except as specified herein to be
furnished by the Government, and shall do all that which is necessary or incidental to the satisfactory and timely performance of the following:


The Offeror’s Price Proposal should contain, at a minimum, the following content in the prescribed format. All cost data should be represented
at both the detail and summary level. For the purposes of this proposal, the “detail” level should be considered to be the contract line item
(CLIN) level by implementation phase. All CLIN-level costs should be summed to the implementation phase level, thereby depicting the costs for
the entire scope of work for that implementation phase. Additionally, the phase-level costs should be summed to the project level, thereby
depicting the costs for the entire scope of work for implementation of the project. Equipment costs, as defined below, should be included in the
implementation costs. Finally, the implementation costs and operations and maintenance (O&M) costs should be summarized, thereby depicting a
total solution cost.

The following information is for the purpose of describing the CLIN structure that will be utilized in the resultant contract.


While the OCC strongly prefers that Offerors utilize the provided CLIN structure, Offerors may propose a different CLIN structure as long as the
following criteria are met:

                     ● Offerors must provide a crosswalk that maps their proposed CLIN structure to the CLIN structure provided by the OCC.  A
                       crosswalk should clearly indicate  the following:

                       ○ Where separate items in the OCC’s CLIN structure are bundled as a single item in the Offeror’s structure

                       ○ Where bundled items in the OCC’s CLIN structure are listed singly in the Offeror’s structure

                       ○ Where elements in the OCC’s structure are not relevant and therefore not included  in the Offeror’s solution

                       ○ Where elements relevant to the Offeror’s solution but not included in the OCC’s CLIN structure need to be inserted
                         into that structure.




                     ● The Offeror’s proposed CLIN structure must be sufficiently granular to clearly describe the task, service, deliverable,
                       and/or milestones that are included within the Offeror’s costs. CLIN structures that are insufficiently detailed will be
                       rejected since they do not describe the work being performed in a way that the OCC can judge the scope and price-
                       reasonableness of each CLIN.




                     ● If the Offeror proposes a different phasing strategy and/or CLIN structure than those suggested by the OCC, the Offeror
                       shall include a graphic in its price proposal that emulates Section J13, Alignment of OCC’s Proposed Implementation Phases
                       with the Associated CLIN Structure, in terms of mapping the CLINs to the phases of the project.



Contract line item (CLIN) prices shall be proposed in MS Excel Spreadsheet format. The Offeror shall include details for each CLIN listed below,
except where amended by the Offeror’s proposal. The Contractor shall furnish necessary personnel, material, equipment, and services to meet the
full performance objectives outlined in the Statement of Objectives (SOO). The OCC intends to award the pilot during the initial award period
and all subsequent phases (Phases 1 through 3) will be exercised as options at the sole discretion of the OCC. CLINs for phases subsequent to
the pilot should be priced solely for that phase and not as a cumulative cost for the solution to allow the OCC to see the cost of each
additional phase independently.




B.1.2 CONTRACT LINE ITEMS FOR SUPPLIES OR SERVICES




Pilot: CLIN 0001 – 0005

PHASE 2: Optional CLINs 0013 – 0019
The following optional CLINs represent the deliverables and activities for the implementation of Phase 2 of the ECM solution, the additional
hardware required for Phase 2, and travel costs incurred during the implementation and/or support of Phase 2. In addition, a CLIN is included
for the O&M required to support the solution components deployed in Phase 1. Finally, CLINs are included for the additional software required
for the implementation of Phase 2 and the ongoing license maintenance for Phase-2 software. As in Phase 1, the OCC reserves the right to buy
software either directly from software Offerors or from the solution provider.

Ongoing Operations & Maintenance Following Implementation of the ECM Solution (O&M Option #1): Optional CLINs 0027 – 0030
The following optional CLINs represent the O&M activities required to support all the functionality implemented during Phases 1 through 3 of
ECMP. Please note that the OCC desires that the combined duration of the Pilot, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, O&M Option #1, and O&M Option #2 be
no greater than 60 months (five calendar years). The OCC also requests that O&M Option #1 be one year in duration, with the duration of O&M
Option #2 being the number of months remaining between the end of O&M Option #1 and the 60-month mark.

Ongoing Operations & Maintenance Following Implementation of the ECM Solution (O&M Option #2): Optional CLINs 0031 – 0034
The following optional CLINs represent the O&M activities required to support all the functionality implemented during Phases 1 through 3 of
ECMP. Please note that the OCC desires that the combined duration of the Pilot, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, O&M Option #1, and O&M Option #2 be
no greater than 60 months (five calendar years). The OCC also requests that O&M Option #1 be one year in duration, with the duration of O&M
Option #2 being the number of months remaining between the end of O&M Option #1 and the 60-month mark.

SECTION G:  CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION DATA

   1. CONTRACTING OFFICER
      The Contracting Officer (CO) designated for administration of this contract will be identified at time of award.  The CO, in accordance
      with Subpart 1.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the
      requirements of this contract, and notwithstanding any clauses contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely with
      the CO.  In the event the Contractor makes any changes at the direction of any other person other than the CO, the change will be
      considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred
      as a result thereof.

        satisfactorily.
     c) Technical direction must be within the scope of the performance work statement / statement of work.  The COTR does not have the
        authority to issue technical direction that:
        1) Constitutes a change of assignment or additional work outside the performance work statement / statement of work.
        2) Constitutes a change as defined in the clause entitled “Changes.”
        3) Causes an increase or decrease in the contract price, or the time required for contract performance.
        4) Changes any of the terms, conditions, or scope of work of the contract.
        5) Interferes with the Contractor’s right to perform under the terms and conditions of the contract.
        6) Directs, supervises or otherwise controls the actions of the Contractor’s employees.

        the Contracting Officer.
     e) The Contractor shall proceed promptly with performance resulting from the technical direction issued by the COTR.  If, in the opinion of
        the Contractor, any direction of the COTR falls within the limitations in (c), above, the Contractor shall immediately notify the
        Contracting Officer no later than the beginning of the next Government work day.
     f) Failure of the Contractor and the Contracting Officer to agree that technical direction is within the scope of the contract shall be
        subject to the terms of the clause entitled “Disputes.”

            (3)  Obtain the Contracting Officer’s written approval.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Contractor deem immediate removal or
           suspension of any member of its management team is necessary to maintain satisfactory standard of employee competency, conduct, and
           integrity, the contractor may remove or suspend such person at once, although the Contractor must notify the Contracting Officer
           prior to or concurrently with such action.

     a)
        i) The contractor shall submit invoices in a format that replicates the line item (CLIN) and subline item (subCLIN) structure of the

       ii) If the contract allows for the submission of partial or periodic invoices, the contractor shall include an additional column, titled

           contractor shall enter the total amount that has been billed for each contract line item and subline item through the end of the
           current invoice period.
      iii) The contractor shall submit invoices that conform to the requirements listed in subparagraphs (a)(i) and (ii) above.  The contractor
           shall not deviate from this format without the expressed, written permission of the contracting officer.  To further clarify the

     b) The contractor shall identify the point of contact (POC) or contracting officer’s technical representative (COTR) for this contract on
        the face sheet of all invoices submitted under the contract.  The POC or COTR for this contract is identified in subparagraph (c)(ii)

|1                |The contractor shall define authorized work elements for the program.  A work breakdown structure (WBS),    |            |            |
|                 |tailored for effective internal management control, is commonly used in this process.                       |            |            |
|2                |The contractor shall identify the program organizational structure, including the major subcontractors      |            |            |
|                 |responsible for accomplishing the authorized work, and define the organizational elements in which work will|            |            |
|                 |be planned and controlled.                                                                                  |            |            |
|3                |The contractor shall provide for integration of the company’s planning, scheduling, budgeting, work         |            |            |
|                 |authorization and cost accumulation processes and, as appropriate, the program WBS and organizational       |            |            |
|                 |structure.                                                                                                  |            |            |
|6                |The contractor shall schedule the authorized work in a manner that describes the sequence of work and       |            |            |
|                 |identifies the significant task interdependencies required to meet the requirements of the program.         |            |            |
|7                |The contractor shall identify physical products, milestones, technical performance goals or other indicators|            |            |
|                 |used to measure progress.                                                                                   |            |            |
|8                |The contractor shall establish and maintain a time-phased budget baseline at the control account level      |            |            |
|                 |against which program performance can be measured.  Initial budgets established for performance measurement |            |            |
|                 |will be based on either internal management goals or the external customer-negotiated target cost, including|            |            |
|                 |estimates for authorized (but incomplete) work.  Budget for long-term efforts may be held in higher-level   |            |            |
|                 |accounts until it is appropriate for allocation at the control account level.  On OCC contracts, if an      |            |            |
|                 |over-target baseline is used for performance measurement reporting purposes; prior notification must be     |            |            |
|                 |provided to the customer.                                                                                   |            |            |
|16               |The contractor shall record direct costs consistently with the budgets in a formal system controlled by the |            |            |
|                 |general books of account.                                                                                   |            |            |
|22               |The contractor shall at least monthly, generate the following information at the control account and other  |            |            |
|                 |levels as necessary for management control using actual cost data from, or reconcilable with, the accounting|            |            |
|                 |system:  The amount of planned budget versus the budget earned for work accomplished.  This comparison      |            |            |
|                 |provides the schedule variance.  The amount of the budget earned versus the actual (applied where           |            |            |
|                 |appropriate) direct costs for the same work.  This comparison provides the cost variance.                   |            |            |
|27               |The contractor shall develop revised cost estimates at completion based on performance to date, commitment  |            |            |
|                 |values for material and estimates of future conditions.  Compare this information with the performance      |            |            |
|                 |measurement baseline to identify variances at completion important to company management and any applicable |            |            |
|                 |customer reporting requirements, including statements of funding requirements.                              |            |            |
|28               |The contractor shall incorporate authorized changes in a timely manner, recording the effects in budgets and|            |            |
|                 |schedules.  Base changes on the amount estimated and budgeted to the program organizations.                 |            |            |


              i. If at any time during performance of the TO, the self verification is determined to be defective, the Contractor shall correct
                 the defect at no additional cost to the government.
             ii. The Government requires integrated baseline reviews. Such reviews shall be scheduled as early as practicable and should be
                 conducted within ninety (30) calendar days after (1) task order award, (2) the exercise of significant task order options, or
                 (3) the incorporation of major modifications. The objective of the integrated baseline review is for the OCC and the Contractor
                 to jointly assess areas, such as the Contractor’s planning, to ensure complete coverage of the statement of work, logical
                 scheduling of the work activities, adequate resourcing, and identification of inherent risks.
            iii. The Contractor shall provide the Cost Performance Report in accordance with the requirements of this task order.
             iv. The Contractor shall provide an Integrated Master Schedule as part of each EVMS report.
              v. The approved EVMS shall only be modified by written bilateral modification to the task order.
             vi. The Contractor agrees to provide access to all pertinent records and data requested by the TO Contracting Officer or duly
                 authorized representative to validate and verify the accuracy and completeness of the EVMS data and ensure that the EVMS
                 complies, and continues to comply, with the ANSI/EIA-748 standard referenced in paragraph (b) of this clause.



     f) To adhere to OCC EVMS requirements the following project and EVM categories are applicable for reporting.


        (1) Identify project WBS to include Phases, Tasks and Activities (Earned Value reporting level will be agreed upon by the contracting
        officer/ project manager).


          i. For Major projects (>$1M) Earned Value calculations will be done at the Activity level.
         ii. For Non-Major projects (<$1M) Earned Value calculations shall be performed at the Phase or Task level.
        iii. Refer to the WBS structure below:


             1.0   Project - Highest level in WBS
                 1.1   Phase - Level 2 in WBS
                       1.1.1 Task – Level 3 in WBS.  EV is performed at this level for Non-Major projects
                            1.1.1.1   Activity – Level 4 in WBS.  EV is performed at this level for Major projects


         iv. The OCC will provide an MS Project schedule with an OCC Detailed Earned Value view which contains the following:


           1. Baseline Start – The date work is scheduled to start on an activity when the Baseline Plan was established. Baseline Plan shall be
              established upon IBR approval.  Refer to section (f) for IBR details.
           2. Baseline Finish – The date work is scheduled to finish on an activity when the Baseline Plan was established. Baseline Plan shall
              be established upon IBR approval
           3. Baseline Cost – The amount of money an activity is intended to cost when the Baseline Plan was established. Baseline Plan shall be
              established upon IBR approval
           4. Actual Start – Date on which an activity was started.  As reported on a monthly basis
           5. Actual Finish – Date on which an activity was completed.  As reported on a monthly basis
           6. Percent Complete – A measure of completion used to determine the remaining duration of a partially completed activity. As reported
              on a monthly basis


           NOTE: Once the project costs and schedule tasks and activities have been properly integrated within the IMS, then the following
           Earned Value elements are automatically calculated by MS Project.


           7. Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP, or Actual Cost (AC)) – The costs actually incurred in accomplishing the work performed within
              a given time period. Budgeted Cost for Work Scheduled (BCWS or Planned Value) – The sum of the budgets for all work packages,

      The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) uses the Central Contractor Registration database as its database for contractor
      information.  Accordingly, the following requirements apply to this contract.


        a) Definitions.  As used in this clause –


        1) "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information require or the
           conduct of business with the Government.


        2) "Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify
           unique business entities.


        3) "Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that
           may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern.  This 4-digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent
           business concern for such purposes as identifying sub-units or affiliates of the parent business concern.


        4) "Registered in the CCR database" means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4, if applicable, is in
           the CCR database; the DUNS number has been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed.
        b)


        1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database
           prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to
           foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.


        2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS+4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer
           to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.


        3) Failure to register in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award of an OCC contract.


        4) Contractors will be registered in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the
           Internet.  However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30
           days.  Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this
           solicitation.


        c) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the
           Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.  To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the
           Contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete.


        d) Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or

        submit an unsolicited proposal to the OCC or the Government which is based on such information until one year after such information is
        released or otherwise made available to the public; and (D) release such information unless such information has previously been
        released or otherwise made available to the public by the OCC.  In addition, the Contractor agrees that to the extent it receives or is
        given access to proprietary data, data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or other confidential or privileged
        technical, business, or financial information under this contract, it shall treat such information in accordance with any restrictions
        imposed on such information.


      (c) The Contractor shall be ineligible to participate in any capacity in OCC contracts, subcontracts, or proposals (solicited and
        unsolicited) which stem directly from the Contractor’s performance of work under this contract.  This restriction shall apply to
        ________ (Contracting Officer shall insert the company name upon award of the contract). This clause shall remain in effect for
        ____________ (Contracting Officer insert timeframe, which should normally be one year after completion of the contract) after the
        completion of this contract.  At the conclusion of this period, the OCC, consistent with applicable conflict of interest regulations,
        will evaluate whether at that time there are any conflicts that may limit the contractor's ability to perform work for the OCC.


      (d) The financial, contractual, organizational and other interests of contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be
        deemed to be the interests of the contractor or the purposes of determining the existence of an Organizational Conflict of Interest.
        Any subcontractor that performs any work relative to this contract shall be subject to this clause.  The contractor agrees to place in
        each subcontract affected by these provisions the necessary language contained in this clause

H.12  1052.222-8003 (OCC) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION (NOV 2009)
      All contractor personnel, regardless of whether or not they are working in an OCC facility, must complete the personal identity
      verification (PIV) process before beginning work under a contract.


      The PIV process is part of a larger process for initiating a background investigation, obtaining an OCC-issued security badge, and
      obtaining an HSPD-12-compliant security badge (referred to as a SmartID). Completing the PIV process is a prerequisite for obtaining an OCC-
      issued security badge and obtaining a SmartID.


      The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) will provide contractor personnel with an electronic PIV form. Contractor
      personnel must enter their name, telephone number, email address, employer’s name, sponsor name, and contract number on the form and return
      it to the COTR.


      Contractor personnel must provide additional information, including Social Security number, date of birth, and place of birth, to Critical
      Infrastructure Protection and Security (CIPS). CIPS will contact contractor personnel for the additional information.
      Contractor personnel must appear in person to complete the PIV process, at which time they must present two acceptable forms of
      identification and complete the PIV form. Requirements for acceptable forms of identification can be found at
      http://www.fedidcard.gov/deploytrain.aspx.  See OCC Clause 1052.245-8007 for requirements regarding in-person appearances for security
      purposes.

      1194.24 Video and multimedia products


      1194.25 Self contained, closed products


      1194.26 Desktop and portable computers


      Subpart C Functional Performance Criteria


      Subpart D Information, Documentation and Support


      The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology
      device, but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and devices so that it can be made accessible if so required by
      the agency in the future.

H.14  1052.242-8000 (OCC) EVALUATION OF CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE (DEC 2010)
     a) The OCC will evaluate the contractor’s performance after contract award.  If this contract has option periods, interim evaluations will
        be conducted at the end of each option period and then a final evaluation report will be prepared at the completion of the entire
        contract.  If this contract does not have renewal options, an evaluation will be conducted upon completion of the contract.
        Notwithstanding the preceding, the Contracting Officer may conduct evaluations more or less frequently, if the Contracting Officer deems
        appropriate.


     b) Evaluations will be conducted using an electronic format as established by Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS),
        an internet-based database of contractor performance information.  The OCC will enter the information, gathered from the evaluation,
        into the CPARS. 


     c) If the contractor responds to the evaluation, and the response rebuts any or all of the ratings, the Contracting Officer will attempt to
        reconcile the areas of disagreement with the contractor.  If agreement cannot be reached, the evaluation and response shall be reviewed
        at a level higher than the Contracting Officer and a final evaluation will be issued by the reviewing official.  If the reviewing
        official finds, either all or in part, against the contractor, the contractor’s response shall become part of the final evaluation.  The
        reviewing official’s final decision shall not be subject to dispute under the terms and conditions of the Disputes clause or subject to
        resolution in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Alternative Dispute Resolution clause.  The reviewing official will
        provide the contractor with a copy of the final evaluation.


     d) Any government agency authorized to access the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database will be able to view the
        performance information related to this contract.  Any government agency may also receive a copy the contractor’s performance
        evaluation, and any associated comments, by contacting the OCC.  The OCC will also, upon request, provide copies of any and all of the
        contractor’s evaluations to the contractor.

H.15  1052.245-8001 (OCC) INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SECURITY AWARENESS TRAINING (SEP 2008)
      The Contractor understands that work to be performed under this contract may require network (logical) access to OCC information resources.
       As used in this clause the term access means “network access to OCC information resources” regardless of location.   Contractor personnel
      must complete initial training on their IT security responsibilities and OCC established system rules of behavior to receive network access
      to OCC information resources.  As used herein, “Contractor personnel” includes, but is not limited to, advisors, consultants, or agents to
      the Contractor, subcontractors or their personnel, or any other persons under the auspices of the Contractor.  Contractor personnel
      requiring network access to OCC information resources must also complete security awareness training annually for the duration of this
      contract.


      The Contractor is responsible for its personnel who require access to OCC information resources.  The Contractor shall provide a list of
      names to the COTR after award to initiate the background investigation process and identify Contractor personnel who require information
      security awareness training.  The   Contractor shall update this list during contract performance to add new Contractor personnel to the
      contract.


      Contractor personnel shall complete the IT Security Awareness Training located at http://www.occ.treas.gov/training/isa.htm before
      receiving network access to OCC information resources, sign and date the certificate at the end of the training with their legal names, and
      provide electronic copies of the certificate to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) at least two weeks prior to the
      need date for network access.  The Contractor shall contact the COTR to ensure timely processing of request(s) or for situations when
      immediate access is required due to circumstances beyond the Contractor’s control.  Failure to meet the requirements of this provision
      could negatively impact the Contractor’s performance rating and/or result in a contract termination pursuant to the termination provisions
      of this contract.


      Contractor personnel shall complete the training annually.  The Contractor must verify completion of training for all personnel in a report
      submitted to the CO, with a copy to the COTR.  The initial training must be completed before Contractor personnel are granted network
      (logical) access.  The annual training must be completed by April 30th of the fiscal year and the Contractor shall submit the report no
      later than May 15th.


      Contractor personnel will be granted access to the Treasury Learning Management System (TLMS) to complete annual IT Security Awareness
      refresher training.  The COTR will provide instructions for completing the annual refresher training in TLMS.  The Contractor is
      responsible for ensuring that all Contractor personnel comply with the requirements of this clause.

H.16  1052.245-8002 (OCC) SEPARATION NOTIFICATION (SEP 2008)
      It is anticipated that during the performance of this contract, the Contractor will replace key and non-key personnel who have access to
      OCC’s network information resources or facilities.  The Contractor Program Manager (PM) shall assist the COTR in initiating the pre-exit
      process for departing key and non-key personnel.  The Contractor shall initiate the pre-exit process for all departing personnel in
      accordance with the terms of this clause.


      The Contractor PM shall access the OCC’s Pre-Exit Program Intranet site, http://occnet.occ/Pre-ExitView.asp, and follow the instructions
      provided in the attachment to this contract to execute the pre-exit process for departing personnel.  Access to the site is only authorized
      via the OCC network.  The pre-exit process shall be initiated at least two weeks before the departure date or reassignment of Contactor
      personnel who no longer require network access to information resources or facilities.  If the Contractor employee or agent departs without
      prior notification, then the Contractor shall initiate the pre-exit process within 24 hours of the departure.  The Contractor shall ensure
      that all Government property and information is returned to the OCC in accordance with the terms of the contract.


      It is the policy of OCC that all separating contractors complete the list of pre-exit activities appended to this contract as an
      attachment. Contractors must ensure that no government property, correspondence, or records, including classified or confidential material,
      are removed from the OCC.

                                                               (End of Attachment)

H.17  1052.245-8003 (OCC)  CONFIDENTIAL OR SENSITIVE INFORMATION (NOV 2009)
      The Contractor understands that work to be performed and information released to the Contractor is, because of the proprietary nature of
      such information, sensitive in nature and is not to be disclosed to anyone other than OCC employees assigned to the contract and other
      Contractor personnel authorized by the Government to receive the information.  The Contractor agrees to protect all confidential and/or
      proprietary information received by or provided to the Contractor pursuant to this contract from unauthorized disclosure or use for as long
      as the information remains proprietary or confidential and further agrees that it will not use such information for any purpose other than
      that relating to the performance of this contract. For purposes of the contract, all information provided to or received by the Contractor
      is deemed confidential and proprietary.


      The Contractor shall execute and is responsible for having all of its employees, subcontractor employees, and agents working under the
      contract and/or having access to sensitive information under this contract execute a statement entitled “Conditional Access to Sensitive
      but Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement.”  This Statement, a copy of which is appended to this contract, provides that
      sensitive but unclassified information provided to the Contractor or its employees or agents shall not, except as permitted in connection
      with the performance of the contract, be further disclosed or used without the prior written approval of the Office of the Comptroller of
      the Currency.  Executed copies of this statement must be completed and returned to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and by all
      Contractor employees or agents who will perform work on the contract before their work begins.  In the event the Contractor fails to submit
      signed Agreements prior to beginning work, the effective date of any agreement received after work begins shall be the date of award.


      Contractor employees who appear in-person for the PIV process at an OCC facility will be required to sign their Non-Disclosure Agreement
      and return it to the security personnel completing the in-process.


H.18  1052.245-8004 (OCC) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS (OCT 2008)
      All Contractor personnel, regardless of whether or not they are working in an OCC facility must submit to a background investigation before
      beginning work under this contract.


      The number and type of investigations will depend on factors including, but not limited to, the length of time an individual will work on a
      contract, an individual’s role, the sensitivity of information an individual will have access to, and the results of past investigations on
      an individual. Investigations typically conducted by the OCC include the National Agency Check (NAC), National Agency Check with Inquiries
      (NACI), and full background investigations (BI).


      Contractor personnel must submit information for background investigations electronically through the e-QIP system (http://www.opm.gov/e-
      QIP/). Critical Infrastructure Protection and Security (CIPS) will notify Contractor personnel when e-QIP is ready to receive their
      information. After submitting their information, Contractor personnel must print required security forms from e-QIP. Printed forms must be
      signed and provided to CIPS.


      For background investigation purposes, Contractor personnel are required to provide a set of fingerprints. Contractor personnel must appear
      in-person to provide fingerprints. See OCC Clause 1052.245-8007 for requirements regarding in-person appearances for security purposes.


      The results of all background investigations will be reviewed and adjudicated by CIPS. Based on investigation results, the OCC has the
      unilateral right to bar an individual from working under a contract or otherwise restrict the individual’s role under a contract.


      The costs for all investigations required under this contract will be borne by the OCC.

H.19  1052.245-8005 (OCC) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OCC- ISSUED SECURITY BADGES (OCT 2009)
      The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) shall determine whether or not Contractor personnel must obtain an OCC-issued
      security badge. Generally, Contractor personnel who require regular access to an OCC facility will require an OCC-issued security badge.
      Contractor personnel who are required to obtain an OCC-issued security badge must provide all required data and complete all procedures
      necessary for issuance of an OCC-issued security badge.


      Contractor personnel must complete the personal identity verification process (PIV) and the Contractor personnel’s background
      investigations must be favorably adjudicated before they can receive an OCC-issued security badge.


      Failure to obtain an OCC-issued security badge in a timely fashion could prevent contractor personnel from beginning work as required under
      this contract. Contractor personnel shall work with the COTR and the Critical Infrastructure and Security (CIPS) staff to obtain their
      badge in a timely fashion.


      Contractor personnel must appear in person to receive their OCC-issued security badge, at which time their photograph will be taken. See
      OCC Clause 1052.245-8007 for requirements regarding in-person appearances for security purposes.


      Contractor personnel must surrender their OCC-issued security badge upon demand of the COTR or the Personnel Security Officer.  Contractor
      personnel must return their OCC-issued security badge to the COTR upon completing work under the contract, or at any other time if for any
      reason they no longer require an OCC-issued security badge.


      OCC-issued security badges are the property of the Government.  Contractor personnel should safeguard OCC-issued security badges against
      loss, theft, and damage. Lost or stolen badges must be reported immediately to CIPS.


H.20  1052.245-8006 (OCC) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HSPD-12 COMPLIANT SECURITY BADGES (OCT 2008)
      The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) shall determine whether or not contractor personnel must obtain an HSPD-12-
      compliant security badge (referred to as a SmartID). Generally, Contractor personnel who require regular access to an OCC facility or
      require access to OCC information systems, either from an OCC facility or remotely, will require a SmartID. Contractor personnel who are
      required to obtain a SmartID must provide all required data and complete all procedures necessary for issuance of a SmartID.


      Contractor personnel must complete the personal identity verification process (PIV) and the Contractor personnel’s background
      investigations must be favorably adjudicated before they can receive a SmartID.


      Contractor personnel must appear in person twice to receive a SmartID. At the first appearance, Contractor personnel will complete the
      personal identity verification process, have their photograph taken, have their fingerprints taken, and complete enrollment for a SmartID.
      At the second appearance, Contractor personnel will receive and activate their SmartID. See OCC Clause 1052.245-8007 for requirements
      regarding in-person appearances for security purposes.


      Failure to obtain a SmartID in a timely fashion could prevent Contractor personnel from beginning work as required under this contract.
      Contractor personnel shall work with the COTR and the Critical Infrastructure and Security (CIPS) staff to obtain their SmartID in a timely
      fashion.


      Contractor personnel must surrender their SmartID upon demand of the COTR or the Personnel Security Officer.  Contractor personnel must
      return their SmartID to the COTR upon completing work under the contract, or at any other time if for any reason they no longer require a
      SmartID.


      SmartIDs are the property of the Government.  Contractor personnel should safeguard SmartIDs against loss, theft, and damage. Lost or
      stolen SmartIDs must be reported immediately to CIPS.


H.21  1052.245-8007 (OCC) IN-PERSON APPEARANCES FOR SECURITY PURPOSES (OCT 2008)
      Contractor personnel must appear in person to:


     1. Complete the personal identity verification (PIV) process
     2. Have their fingerprint taken for a background investigation
     3. Obtain an OCC-issued security badge
     4. Enroll for an HSPD-12-compliant security badge (referred to as a SmartID)
     5. Receive and activate a SmartID.


      Generally, one or more of these activities are completed during a single in-person appearance. An individual typically requires two in-
      person appearances to complete all tasks, but more in-person appearances may be required under some circumstances.


      The location at which Contractor personnel must appear depends on the contract place of performance and security badge requirements.
      Generally, Contractor personnel performing work in the Washington, DC area will be required to appear at the OCC Headquarters building.
      Contractor personnel working elsewhere will generally be required to appear at a USAccess credentialing center operated by the General
      Services Administration (GSA). (A list of GSA-operated credentialing centers can be found at http://www.fedidcard.gov/deployoss.aspx.)


      Contractor personnel requiring in person appearances at an OCC facility will schedule their appearance with the COTR or an authorized
      representative. The COTR or an authorized representative will escort Contractor personnel while they are in the OCC facility.


H.22  1052.245-8008 (OCC) INFORMATION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR UNCLASSIFIED OCC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES (JAN 2009)
   I. DEFINITIONS
        Definitions, as used in this clause, generally refer to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) unless a more specific provision is noted
        below.


        Adequate Security
        Security that is commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or
        modification of information.  This includes assuring that systems and applications in use operate effectively and provide appropriate

        Availability
        To ensure the timely and reliable access to, and use of, information.


        Confidentiality
        Preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary
        information.


        Information Resource
        An information resource encompasses both information and information related resources such as personnel, equipment, data, and
        information technology.


        Information System
        A discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, transmission, and dissemination of
        information, in accordance with defined procedures, whether automated or manual.


        Information Technology
        With respect to the OCC, information technology means any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment, used in the
        automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange,
        transmission, or reception of data or information by the OCC, if the equipment is used by the OCC directly or is used by a contractor
        under a contract with the OCC that requires the use:
        i. of that equipment; or
       ii. of that equipment to a significant extent in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.  Information technology
           includes computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging peripherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for security and
           surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be controlled by the central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and

        shared.


  II. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
        1) The service provider shall be responsible for adhering to OCC information technology (IT) security requirements for all information
           systems connected to an OCC network or operated by the Contractor for, or on behalf of, the OCC, regardless of location. This clause
           applies to all or any part of the contract that includes information technology, information resources or services for which the
           Contractor must have physical or electronic access to OCC information.
        2) OCC information technology, including information, shall remain in the United States.  The maintenance, operation, and/or processing
           of said resources must take place, and originate from, within the United States.
        3) The service provider shall maintain a complete and accurate inventory of all OCC-provided information resources.  The inventory shall
           be made available for inspection immediately upon request by the OCC.
        4) The service provider facility hosting OCC information resources must meet all applicable state and local zoning, environmental, and
           building laws and regulations.  The facility must include protection against unauthorized access at all hours, including alarms and
           notification systems should such protection be breached.
        5) Confirmed security compromises to any OCC information resource must be reported to the OCC within 60 minutes of discovery by the
           Service Provider.
        6) The service provider shall ensure that its employees, in the performance of the contract, receive and document information security
           awareness training in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130 and Federal Information Security
           Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 requirements, as they may be amended from time to time during the term of this contract.
        7) Service providers shall grant the Government access to any and all facilities and information resources used in support of the
           contract.  The OCC shall conduct regular reviews, at a minimum yearly, to ensure that the security requirements in the contract are
           implemented, enforced, effective, and operating as intended.  These reviews include, but are not limited to, comprehensive technical
           testing of the control environment used to safeguard OCC information resources.
        8) At the expiration of the contract, the service provider shall return all OCC information resources provided to, or generated by, the
           service provider during the period of the contract.  The service provider shall provide certification that all OCC information has
           been sanitized from any service provider-owned information system in accordance with OCC standards and procedures.
        9) The Contractor will reimburse the OCC for any OCC-issued IT that is lost, stolen, missing, unaccounted for, or damaged.  The rate of
           reimbursement will be determined by fair market value.


 III. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS
        1) The service provider shall have fully completed, attested, and submitted to the Contracting Officer the OCC’s Service Provider Self
           Assessment (OCC Form CC 9070-02) prior to the execution of the contract.
        2) The service provider shall maintain a computing environment with adequate security at all times.  This includes, but is not limited
           to, the description and documentation of the processes and procedures that will be followed to ensure the security of IT resources
           that are developed, processed, transmitted, used, or maintained under this contract and comprehensive technical testing of the
           Contractor’s computing environment by the OCC.
        3) Prior to the execution of the contract, the OCC will validate adequate security controls in the Contractor environment.  The
           validation shall be conducted by the OCC as part of an on-site inspection process.
           A) The Contractor agrees to demonstrate, to personnel authorized by the OCC, the technical, operational, and managerial safeguards
              that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of OCC information that it develops, processes, transmits, uses, or
              maintains during the execution of this contract.
           B) The on-site inspection serves to ensure the computing environment complies with Federal laws that include, but are not limited to,
              the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA); and with Federal policies and procedures that include, but are
              not limited to, OMB Circular A-130, FIPS Publications 199 and 200, Department of the Treasury Directive 85-01, and OCC Policy and
              Procedures Manual 4000-1 (REV).  Copies of these documents are maintained by the OCC Information Risk Management division and are
              available upon request.  Failure to maintain compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, and guidance may be cause for
              contract termination.
           C) The Contractor must maintain an active information security program.  The program shall specifically address methods regarding
              handling and protecting OCC information at the Contractor’s site (including any information stored, processed, or transmitted
              using the Contractor’s computer systems), and the secure management, operation, maintenance, programming, and system
              administration of computer systems, networks, and telecommunications systems.
           D) The service provider may use additional safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of OCC information other than as provided for by
              this contract as deemed necessary.
           E) The Contractor shall, at their own expense, take action to mitigate, to the extent practicable, any harmful effect that is known
              to the Contractor of a use or disclosure of OCC information by the Contractor in violation of the requirements of this clause.


  IV. OBLIGATIONS TO THE OCC
        1) The OCC’s Information Risk Management division maintains the information on current information security requirements and standards
           and will provide details to the Contractor upon request.  The service provider will be notified of any substantive changes to
           information security requirements that have a significant impact on the Service Provider’s information security obligations under
           this contract.
        2) The OCC will evaluate the need for a new on-site inspection at a minimum once each year.  The OCC in its sole discretion may
           determine that a new on-site inspection is necessary.

H.23  1052.245-8009 (OCC) CITIZENSHIP OR RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS OR CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL (MAY 2009)
      The Contractor shall ensure that all employees, agents, and subcontractors having unescorted access to OCC's facilities or access to
      information systems, security items, or sensitive but unclassified information are United States citizens or have lawful permanent resident
      status.

H.24  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED ITEMS
      The OCC will provide, to the extent necessary, access to the local network for email and public folder purposes.  The Government may
      provide laptops, office space, limited office supplies, furniture, and access to telephone lines, printers, fax machines and copiers.  Long-
      distance telephone access shall be limited to OCC business only.

                                                                 End of Section H

   2. CONTRACT CLAUSES IN FULL TEXT


I.2.1 52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)
      The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.  These rates
      may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.  The option provision may be
      exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months.  The Contracting Officer may exercise
      the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of contract expiration.




I.2.2 52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)*
     a. The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 day prior to the expiration of the
        contract, provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before
        the contract expires.  The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.


     b. If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.




     c. The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 96 months.


        *This clause will be revised at time award to reflect the implementation schedule.



I.2.3 52.237-3 CONTINUITY OF SERVICES (JAN 1991)
     a) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption
        and that, upon contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another contractor, may continue them.  The Contractor agrees
        to –
     1. Furnish phase-in training; and
     2. Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor.


     b) The Contractor shall, upon the Contracting Officer’s written notice, (1) furnish phase-in, phase-out services for up to 90 days after
        this contract expires and (2) negotiate in good faith a plan with a successor to determine the nature and extent of phase-in, phase-out
        services required.  The plan shall specify a training program and a date for transferring responsibilities for each division of work
        described in the plan, and shall be subject to the Contracting Officer’s approval.  The Contractor shall provide sufficient experienced
        personnel during the phase-in, phase-out period to ensure that the services called for by this contract are maintained at the required
        level of proficiency.


     c) The Contractor shall allow as many personnel as practicable to remain on the job to help the successor maintain the continuity and
        consistency of the services required by this contract.  The Contractor also shall disclose necessary personnel records and allow the
        successor to conduct on-site interviews with these employees.  If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor shall
        release them at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of their earned fringe benefits to the successor.
     d) The Contractor shall be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed period after
        contract expiration that result from phase-in, phase-out operations) and a fee (profit) not to exceed a pro rata portion of the fee
        (profit) under this contract.



                                                                 End of Section I

K.3   52.209-5  CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)



      (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that—
      (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals—
      (A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
      agency;
      (B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
      for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State,
      or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
      embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal
      criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this
      solicitation);
      (C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
      the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
      (D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
      exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
      (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
      determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability
      is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
      (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
      payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
         (2) Examples.
      (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
      of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court
      review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
      (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
      under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further
      appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest
      the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax
      because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the
      taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
      (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
      full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full
      payment.
      (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
      U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
      (ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
      Federal agency.
      (2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management
      or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and
      similar positions).

      This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or
      Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.

      (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror
      learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.


      (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award
      under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility.
      Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render
      the Offeror nonresponsible.


      (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good
      faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed
      that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.


      (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making
      award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to
      the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

        (2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the

L.4   1052.209-8001 (OCC) ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE/REPERESENTATION (NOV 2009)
      (a)   Organizational conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or
           potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person’s objectivity in performing the contract
           work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.

      (b)   An offeror notified that it is the apparent successful offeror shall provide the statement described in paragraph (c) of this
           provision.  For purposes of this provision, “apparent successful offeror” means the offeror selected for final negotiations or, where
           individual contracts are negotiated with all firms in the competitive range, it means all such firms.  The requirements of this
           provision apply individually to any of the offeror’s identified consultants or subcontractors that also furnish advisory and
           assistance services in performance of this contract.


      (c)   The statement must contain the following:


           (1)   Name of the agency and the number of the solicitation in question.


           (2)   The name, address, telephone number, and federal taxpayer identification number of the apparent successful offeror.

                 the name, address, telephone number of the client or client(s), a description of the services rendered to the previous
                 client(s), and the name of a responsible officer or employee of the offeror who is knowledgeable about the services rendered to
                 each client, if, in the 12 months preceding the date of the statement, services were rendered to the Government or any other
                 client (including a foreign government or person) respecting the same subject matter of the instant solicitation, or directly
                 relating to such subject matter.  The agency and contract number under which the services were rendered must also be included,
                 if applicable.  For financial interests, the statement must include the nature and extent of the interest and any entity or
                 entities involved in the financial relationship.  For these and any other interests enough such information must be provided to
                 allow a meaningful evaluation of the potential effect of the interest on the performance of the statement of work.


           (5)   A statement that no actual or potential conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage exists with respect to the
                 advisory and assistance services to be provided in connection with the instant contract or that any actual or potential conflict
                 of interest or unfair competitive advantage that does or may exist with respect to the contract in question has been
                 communicated as part of the statement required by (b) above.


        d) Failure of the offeror to provide the required statement may result in the offeror being determined ineligible for award.
           Misrepresentation or failure to report any fact may result in the assessment of penalties associated with false statements or such
           provisions provided for by law or regulation

      affiliation with a national bank.


      (b) This solicitation contains a special clause in Section H.11 entitled, “Organizational Conflicts of Interest”, which is to appear in the
      awarded contract.


      (c) If the offeror has completed the Attachment, Disclosure/Representation Statement of the OCC Clause 1052.209-8001, “Organizational
      Conflict of Interest Disclosure/Representation” indicating a potential conflict exists, the offeror shall in accordance with the 1052.209-
      8000, “Organizational Conflict of Interest,” disclose any and all information necessary to ascertain whether an organizational conflict of
      interest does exist, and if so, whether a waiver should be requested.


      (d) The offeror shall take all reasonable steps to obtain documentation of organizational conflicts of interest, and shall cooperate fully
      with the Government in resolving such issues expeditiously.


      (e) Along with responses to this solicitation, offerors must identify in the OCI Disclosure/Representative Statement either (1) submit the
      information concerning any potential conflict of interest; or (2) state that to the best of the offeror’s knowledge no OCI, or potential

L.8   SUBMISSION OF OFFERS
      The Offeror shall clearly present information that fully addresses each of the evaluation criteria of this solicitation. Each Offeror shall
      submit a complete and thorough proposal in accordance with the instructions in this document. Such a proposal must (l) support the
      requirements for all implementation phases, as stated in the SOO and (2) accept the provisions, terms and conditions and clauses stated in
      all sections of this RFP.


      To aid in the evaluations, proposals shall be appropriately labeled and logically assembled. All proposals shall be labeled on the outside
      with the Offeror's name, address, and solicitation number. All pages of each proposal shall be appropriately numbered, and identified with
      the name of the Offeror and solicitation number. Prospective Offerors are asked to submit material that is directly pertinent to the
      requirements of this RFP. Illustrations shall be used wherever practical to depict organizations, systems and layout, implementation
      schedules, plans, etc. These displays shall be clear, concise, and legible; they shall not exceed the 8.5" x 11" size paper, with text no
      smaller than 12-point font, except where indicated. Extraneous narrative, elaborate brochures, marketing or promotional material, and so
      forth, should not be submitted.


      Two copies, an original and backup copy, of the proposal and all supporting documentation shall be submitted in electronic copy on separate
      compact disks (CD-ROMs). The CD copy shall be formatted in MS Office Version 2003 or higher. The disk or CD copy shall include all volumes
      of the proposal. All disks shall include a label identifying the Offeror's name, address, and solicitation number. In addition, a single
      original copy and all supporting documentation shall be provided in hard copy. The original proposal shall be clearly labeled and shall
      contain the original of all documents requiring signature by the Offeror, to include any or all amendment(s).


      Offerors shall submit proposals consisting of two (2) separate volumes. Volume I is the Technical Proposal. Volume II is the Price
      Proposal, which will include both the Management Approach and the Technical Approach. Specific instructions for the preparation and page
      limitation of each proposal are provided in these instructions. Pages beyond the maximum limit will not be evaluated. Facsimile, e-mail,
      and photocopy proposals are not authorized for this solicitation.


      For purposes of page limits, each "page" is defined as one sheet, 8.5” x 11", with at least one-inch margins on all sides, using a font
      size of 12 points or greater, unless otherwise indicated. Lines shall, at a minimum, be single spaced. Pages shall be consecutively
      numbered. Multiple pages, double pages, two-sided pages, and foldouts will count as an equivalent number of 8.5” x 11" pages.


L.9   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS
      The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) intends to conduct this acquisition in two major steps. Step 1 of the acquisition
      begins with the evaluation of the proposals, and may continue with communications with offerors before establishment of the competitive
      ranged pursuant to FAR 15.306, and conclude with the determination of the competitive range. Step 2 of the acquisition involves a
      demonstration of selected functions of the solution by Offerors determined to be in the competitive-range, which could potentially be re-
      established after completion of the demonstrations. Offerors will be given four (4) weeks to prepare their demonstrations. The contract
      will be awarded for the pilot phase of the Economics Computing Modernization (ECM) solution implementation, after submission and evaluation
      of Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs). Phases 1 through 3 of the ECM implementation will be contract options that may be awarded at a future
      date, subject to the successful completion of the earlier phase(s) of the implementation, the satisfactory performance of the solution, and
      the availability of funds.

      During both steps of the procurement, the OCC may utilize a team of external advisors to support the evaluation of the Offerors’ proposals
      and demonstrations. The OCC may utilize the services of personnel from Gartner, Inc., TeraThink and a not-for-profit educational
      institution in the evaluation process. Both Gartner and TeraThink have disclosed that they have no client relationships that will adversely
      impact their ability to provide impartial and objective assistance to the OCC regarding this acquisition. All decisions with regard to
      source selection will be made exclusively by the OCC.


      Each of the non-government personnel supporting this acquisition shall be required to sign a non-disclosure statement, as well as a
      statement that any and all information received shall not be used in any way for personal use or gain nor divulged to another party prior
      to, during, or after award of the contract. Any and all information to be released shall be released by government personnel only.


L.10  INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING THE TECHNICAL PROPOSAL -VOLUME I
      The Technical Proposal is composed of three sections: the Technical Approach, Management Approach and Past Performance.  The Technical
      Approach is limited to 50 pages, and the Management Approach is limited to 35 pages, for a total proposal length not to exceed 85 pages.

L.10.1      Proposal Compliance Matrix
      The Offeror shall provide a proposal compliance matrix that demonstrates that all content required in the proposal, as per these
      instructions, is indeed included in the appropriate proposal volume (i.e., Technical or Price).


      The Compliance Matrix shall be included in both volumes I and II as an appendix, which is not included in the total page count limitation.


L.10.2      TECHNICAL APPROACH
      Offerors should clearly and concisely explain how they propose to architect and implement a solution that meets both:
         ● The OCC’s objectives as stated in the ECMP Statement of Objectives (SOO)

         ● The OCC’s requirements as stated in the ECMP Solution Use Case Model and Technical and Performance Requirements

      Offerors should propose specific tasks and deliverables based on their understanding of what will constitute a suitable solution; they
      should ensure that their solution encompasses the entire scope of work from planning through implementation (i.e., the pilot through Phase
      3, as defined in the SOO) and into transition and maintenance. Merely stating that Offerors have performed similar work in the past or that
      they have “proven methodologies” for doing the work is not sufficient. Proposals must demonstrate a successful history of implementing
      similar solutions of comparable size, complexity, and scope for one or more organizations performing research analytics.


      Each phase of the implementation should be addressed separately, specifically referencing how the implementation will meet the
      Implementation Objectives of the SOO. Offerors should pay particular attention to the Success Criteria provided for the pilot and Phases 1
      and 2. They should ensure that their solution addresses each criterion. In addition, specific details should be provided regarding the
      Offeror’s approach to data migration during the pilot, as well as Phases 1 and 3.


      Deliverables shall be proposed and scheduled based on the guidance given in the SOO. Offerors are free to propose different deliverables if
      their solutions necessitate doing so; however, each deviation, addition, or deletion shall be accompanied by a clear and concise
      explanation of the reason(s) for the proposed changes. The cost and risk implications of those changes should also be addressed.


      During Step 2 of the procurement, Offerors should be aware that competitive-range Offerors will be required to submit a sample document for
      each of those deliverables identified as fixed-price deliverables in the SOO. As a sample, this document might have been delivered for a
      previous engagement; therefore, the OCC expects that customer-proprietary or customer-identifying information will be redacted. If a
      competitive-range Offeror has no samples of a given document that were produced for a previous customer, the following information should
      be submitted in lieu of the sample document:


         ● A detailed description of the document scope, including an explanation of any information that will specifically be  excluded,  if  it
           is felt that the OCC might expect this content to be part of the document

         ●  A page limit (if relevant)

         ●  An annotated table of contents that includes references to appendices (if relevant).

      In addition, Offerors should be aware that the Awardee of this contract will be subject to independent verification and validation (IV&V)
      during Phases 1 through 3 of the implementation. IV&V activities will be conducted at the OCC’s discretion and by the OCC’s selected
      Vendor.


      In addition to describing the general content outlined above, Offerors are required to address the following specific topics in their
      Technical Approach.


L.10.3      REQUIREMENTS COMPLIANCE MATRIX
      Offerors shall identify whether the proposed solution meets or will not meet each requirement in the ECMP Technical and Performance
      Requirements. Each status is defined as follows:
      Meets the Requirement
           • For Mandatory requirements - If the solution meets a mandatory requirement, the Offeror can fulfill the requirement as stated. There
             is no aspect of the requirement that cannot be entirely fulfilled.

           • For Negotiable requirements[4] - If the solution meets a negotiable requirement, the Offeror can either fulfill the  requirement  as
             stated or fulfill the requirement within the parameters identified as negotiable. If the requirement can only  be  fulfilled  within
             the negotiable parameters, the Offeror must clearly (but concisely) identify how the negotiable element of the requirement  will  be
             fulfilled. For example, if a requirement is “negotiable with regard to timeframe,” the matrix should  clearly  state  the  timeframe
             within which the functionality associated with the requirement will be performed or executed. Lacking information  regarding  how  a
             negotiable requirement will be met, the OCC will assume the requirement cannot be met by the proposed solution.

      Does Not Meet the Requirement
           •  For both Mandatory and Negotiable requirements – If the solution does not meet a requirement in its entirety, as described  in  the
             two bullets above, the requirement should be labeled “does not meet.” For the purposes of this solution, partial  fulfillment  of  a
             requirement should be categorized as “does not meet the requirement”.

           • For both Mandatory and Negotiable requirements – If the solution requires customization in order to meet a  requirement,  this  fact
             must be clearly stated. In addition, the Offeror should provide insight into the approximate level of effort for that  customization
             to be made. Where functionality cannot be used “out of the box,” the Offeror must explain the complexity of the  customization,  its
             potential impact on cost and schedule, and its implications for ongoing maintenance.

      The requirements compliance matrix, which should be placed in an appendix, is not considered part of the page count for the Technical
      Approach.


L.10.4      PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT
      The Offeror shall submit a PWS that details the following:
         ● Objectives of the project

         ● Implementation approach for each of the four phases of the solution

         ● Proposed tasks and deliverables to complete implementation, transition, and the operations and maintenance of the solution.

      The PWS should include in its proposed tasks and deliverables the Offeror’s approach for implementing the OCC’s security requirements.
      Discuss both logical and physical security considerations and describe how sensitive data, including personally identifiable information
      (PII), will be secured.


      Please note that the PWS is considered part of the Technical Approach, and as such, will be included in the page count for the Technical
      Proposal.


L.10.5      SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE
      Describe the overall architecture for the solution, including all environments, specifically referencing how the architecture will meet the
      Infrastructure Objectives of the SOO. Identify all hardware and software used in the system. Describe how these components will be
      integrated to form a complete system solution, including where GUI will be provided and for what purpose. Describe the disaster recovery
      architecture. Identify the core technologies on which the system depends. Provide Logical and Physical Architecture Models (two artifacts
      required).


      SAS Proposed Architecture Section J, Attachment J.6 provides the recommended solution architecture to support the SAS components of the
      solution. To the extent the Offeror’s proposed architecture deviates from the recommended architecture, the Offeror shall explain the
      differences, provide a reasoned rationale, and discuss the cost and risk implications. Please see the discussion on the architecture
      constraint in Section L.10.5.1 for further information on this topic.


      Please note that the architecture narrative is considered part of the Technical Approach, and as such, will be included in the page count
      for the Technical Proposal. The diagrams of the logical and physical architecture models should be placed in an appendix to the Technical
      Proposal, and these two diagrams will not be included in the page count for the Technical Proposal.


L.10.5.1    ARCHITECTURE CONSTRAINT
      Given the important role that SAS software plays in supporting the activities of the OCC’s Economics Department, the ECM solution must be
      architected to ensure satisfactory performance from the SAS software suite. To this end, the OCC has engaged SAS to develop a recommended
      architecture for the SAS components of the ECM solution included in Section J, Attachment J.6, SAS Recommended Architecture.


      Offerors will be required to submit, as part of their Technical Approach, architecture for the ECM solution as a whole. They will be
      expected to demonstrate that their proposed solution architectures are compliant, with respect to the SAS components, with the recommended
      architecture developed by SAS for its software.  As the foundation of its solution architecture, the Offeror is required to use SAS grid
      technology.  However, Offerors may propose additional components to supplement the grid architecture (e.g., a data store).  It is incumbent
      on these Offerors to demonstrate the technical, management, business, performance, and/or cost benefits of proposing these additional
      components.


      In consideration of SAS’s role as an architecture advisor to the OCC for the ECM solution, SAS is precluded from bidding as a prime
      contractor on this procurement.


L.10.6      SERVICES PROVISION
      Describe the approach for services provision, specifically referencing how the services provided will meet the Support Services Objectives
      of the SOO. Each service should be addressed separately and in detail; for the following services, the OCC also requires the description of
      the specific operational processes that will be implemented to support each.


         ● Data Management Services

         ● Change Management Services

         ● Configuration Management Services

         ● Help Desk Support Services

      For these four services, enough detail should be included for the OCC to understand the level of support that will be provided on a daily,
      weekly, and monthly basis.


      Furthermore, the response should demonstrate the Offeror’s understanding of the OCC’s requirements and its ability to address those
      requirements. Utilizing “boilerplate” language to describe the Offeror’s approach to providing these services will not constitute a
      responsive proposal.


L.10.7      SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT
      Describe the approach to creating, managing, and monitoring the SLA, specifically referencing how the SLA will meet the Solution SLA
      Objectives of the SOO. The proposed SLA should use the SLA provided by the OCC in Section J, Attachment J.3, ECMP Service-Level Agreement,
      as a baseline agreement. If Offerors wish to do so, they may propose changes or additions to that baseline. All changes and/or additions
      should address the SLA Business Objectives, as specified in the SOO, and identify the penalties for failing to meet the proposed levels of
      service. If Offerors wish to propose incentives associated with the SLA, they should do so only for levels of service that exceed the
      specified standard. The OCC will not pay incentives for achieving the mutually agreed levels of service.


      The SLA is not included within the page count of the Technical Approach; it should be placed in an appendix to the Technical Proposal.



L.10.8      Testing Approach

      Describe the approach for the following types of testing: system (including performance, availability, and disaster-recovery testing),
      regression, 508 compliance, and user acceptance. Indicate how the testing will meet the Solution Testing Objectives and Solution Testing
      Requirements of the SOO. Identify the testing and configuration management tools that will be used. Discuss the requirements for test
      environments and how they will be managed. Explain the approach for creating and managing test data. Differences between testing
      environments and the production environment should be clearly identified and explained.


L.10.9      Technical Approach Page Limits and Formatting Requirements

      The Technical Approach is limited to 50 pages in length. These pages are to be 8.5 x 11 inches in size. For text appearing in the narrative
      sections of the document (including headers, footers and cover pages), the font size should be no smaller than 12 point.  The font size for
      text appearing in the footnotes, captions, figures, and tables should be no smaller than 8 points. The font style is left to the Offeror’s
      discretion.


      With the exception of the following artifacts, which should be appended to the Technical Proposal, all content of the Technical Approach is
      included within the 50-page limit:


         ● Requirements Compliance Matrix
         ● Logical and Physical Architecture Models
         ● Service-Level Agreement

L.10.10     Management Approach
      For all the tasks proposed, Offerors should clearly and concisely explain how they propose to manage the work. The Management Approach
      should include the components described in Sections L.10.10.1 through L.10.10.9.

L.10.10.1   Project Management Approach
      Please explain the methodology that will be employed to manage the activities for the ECMP implementation. This methodology should be
      appropriate for the type of technology and implementation approach that the Offeror is proposing. This discussion should also include an
      explanation of the Offeror’s approach to managing and ensuring quality.

L.10.10.2   Work Breakdown Structure Project Schedule
      At a minimum, the WBS and project schedule should include all milestones for each phase of the project and all deliverables either proposed
      by the Offeror or required by the OCC. If Offerors wish to decompose the WBS and schedule to a lower level of detail, that is acceptable.
      Both artifacts should be sufficiently detailed for the OCC to have a clear understanding of what work will be performed during each phase
      of the implementation, the durations of the key work streams, and how those work streams are interrelated.


      Please note that the WBS and project schedule can be delivered as two separate artifacts, or they can be combined into one document. They
      should be placed in an appendix and are thus excluded from the page count for the Management Approach.


L.10.10.3   Staffing Approach and Personnel Retention Strategy

      Please explain how the proposed project team will be staffed and how the team members will be retained to ensure personnel continuity.
      Please be mindful of the OCC’s requirements regarding security clearances when staffing this project. All staff supporting this project
      must be either U.S. citizens or U.S. permanent residents.  Personnel who fail to meet this requirement will not be cleared by the OCC and
      therefore will not be able to participate in this project in any way.


      Describe how knowledge-transfer will be managed in situations where team members depart the project. Explain how communication between the
      proposed project team, OCC staff, and other ECMP contractors will be successfully maintained when individuals are working remotely.
      Describe how any customer-service concerns expressed by the OCC will be addressed when members of the project team are working off-site or
      in a remote location.

L.10.10.4   Teaming Arrangements
      Please identify the different Offerors that constitute the Offeror’s project team and describe the relevant capabilities that they bring to
      the team. For each task, describe what types of services will be provided by each Offeror. The discussion of teaming arrangements should
      make clear why particular organizations were chosen to participate as members of the Offeror’s team.  Additionally, please provide
      information pertaining to the nature of the teaming arrangement (e.g., affiliate, teaming partner, joint venture, subcontractor, etc.).

L.10.10.5   Quality Control Plan
      The Offeror should include, as part of its Management Approach, a Quality Control Plan (QCP) that addresses the tasks, deliverables, and
      performance measures identified in its proposal. If the Offeror proposes modifications to any of the tasks, deliverables, and/or
      performance measures described by the SOO, the QCP should reflect those adjustments. This QCP should take into account the PMO quality-
      assurance process for evaluating deliverables that is described in the SOO.

L.10.10.6   Resumes
      The Offeror shall submit a resume for each of the persons designated as "key personnel" for this requirement. At a minimum, the following
      roles require resumes: Project Manager, Solution Architect, Test Lead, and SAS Subject-Matter Expert (SME). The Offeror shall identify the
      responsibilities for each position and demonstrate that the key personnel proposed are fully qualified in terms of specific skills and
      skill levels, pertinent technical management experience on jobs of similar scope, and past performance on those jobs. Resumes shall include
      the following content:
         ● Position Description - Provide a brief description of the duties for this position.

         ● Summary of Qualifications - Provide a brief summary of why the person is qualified for the position.

         ● Education (and Training) - Provide degree(s) earned, major field of study, and name of college or university.

         ● Professional and/or Technical Certifications - List certifications earned and name of certifying body and  year  awarded.  List  only
           those certifications that are relevant to the nature of the solution being proposed.

         ● Employment History - Provide name of employer, total period of employment with employer, and reverse  chronological  listing  of  job
           assignment. List only job assignments relevant to the individual’s  proposed  role  on  ECMP.  For  each  job  assignment,  show  the
           candidate's:

           ○ Position description or labor category and duration of assignment, including month and year

            ○ Major customer(s) and program(s) served on the assignment

           ○ Specific relevance of work performed, including accomplishments or innovations in technical or managerial performance.



      The resumes should demonstrate the depth and breadth of the key personnel’s experience,  both  with  the  technologies  proposed  and  with
      projects similar to ECMP in scope, size, and complexity.  Individual resumes are limited to three (3) 8.5 x 11-inch pages each, with a font
      size no smaller than 12 points.  The format of the resumes is left to the discretion of the Offeror; however, all resumes included  in  the
      Offeror’s proposal must follow the same format.


      Resumes, which should be provided in an appendix, are excluded from the page count for the Management Approach.

L.10.10.7   Risk Management
      Please explain the approach that the Offeror will use to identify, manage, and mitigate risks throughout all phases of the implementation
      (including operations and maintenance phases). This approach should be specific to ECMP, not a general discussion of risk management.  The
      Offeror’s risk management approach should include the following components, as described in Sections L.10.10.7.1 through L.10.10.7.3.

L.10.10.7.1 Offeror’s Explanation of the Solution Architecture with Regard to its Ability to Mitigate Risk

      If the Offeror proposes to deviate from the SAS recommended architecture, this section of the Management Approach should explain how the
      Offeror’s proposed solution architecture successfully mitigates technical, cost, schedule, and other types of project risk.  If the Offeror
      does not propose to deviate from the SAS recommended architecture, this section of the proposal is not required.

L.10.10.7.2 Risk Management Plan
      The Offeror is required to submit, as a separate artifact provided in an appendix, the Risk Management Plan it proposes to use throughout
      all phases of the ECMP implementation. The Risk Management Plan is excluded from the page count for the Management Approach.



L.10.10.7.3 Risk Register
      The Offeror should include, as part of its Risk Management Plan, a matrix that identifies, at a minimum, ECMP risks for the following
      categories:
         ● Technical (including data-management and performance risks)

         ● Cost

         ● Schedule (including dependency risks)

         ● Change management (including user-adoption risks)

         ● Security (including privacy risks)

         ● Business (including strategic risks)

      For each identified risk, please document a description, category, probability (as a percentage), impact (high, medium, or low), triggering
      event/condition, and mitigation strategy. This risk register should provide a comprehensive assessment of the key risks  that  the  Offeror
      has identified for the project. Upon contract award, this risk register will become the  baseline  risk  register  that  the  Offeror  will
      maintain and deliver to the OCC on a regular basis. The Risk Register is excluded from the page count for the Management Approach.

L.10.10.8   Approach to User Adoption of the Solution
      Describe the Offeror’s approach to managing organizational change to ensure that all OCC Economics users transition successfully from the
      “as is” computing environment to the new ECMP solution environment. Describe the training, knowledge-sharing, and/or communication
      activities that will occur in support of the user-adoption effort.

L.10.10.9   Exit Plan
      Describe the approach that will be used to transition the OCC’s infrastructure (both hardware and software) and/or data to another solution
      provider’s hosting facility in the event that an existing contract comes to an end, a contract option is not executed, or the Offeror goes
      out of business.

L.10.10.10  Management Approach Page Limits and Formatting Requirements
      The Management Approach is limited to 35 pages in length. These pages are to be 8.5 x 11 inches in size. For text appearing in the
      narrative sections of the document, the font size should be no smaller than 12 points. The font size for text appearing in the footnotes,
      captions, figures, and tables should be no smaller than 8 points. The font style is left to the Offeror’s discretion.


      With the exception of the following artifacts, which should be provided in appendices, all content of the Management Approach is included
      within the 35-page limit:


         ● WBS and Project Schedule – Please note that these can be delivered as two separate artifacts,  or  they  can  be  combined  into  one
           document.

         ● Risk Management Plan, including the Risk Register

         ● QCP

         ● Resumes

      While the appendices are not page-limited, Offerors are not permitted to include in their Technical Proposal any appendices not specified
      by these instructions.  The complete Technical Proposal, including the Technical Approach and Management Approach, is limited to a total 85
      pages, appendices and Past Performance references excepted.


L.10.11 Past Performance
      This section shall contain three (3) references that meet the following criteria:


        1. All three (3) referenced solutions should use many of the same technologies being proposed for the ECM solution. At  a  minimum,  SAS
           must be one of the components of each of the three (3) referenced solutions, and the referenced solutions must  include  other  data-
           analytics applications besides SAS (ideally some of the same applications being used by the OCC, e.g. Stata or Matlab).

        2. The three (3) referenced solutions must be of similar size, scope, and complexity to the effort described in the SOO.

        3. At least one (1) of the referenced solutions should be for a customer in the banking or financial-services sector. (A reference  from
           a customer in the banking or financial-services sector may receive more weight in terms of relevancy.)  A solution  for  a  financial
           regulatory agency will also satisfy this requirement.

        4. At least two (2) of the referenced solutions must have been hosted in either a shared or dedicated infrastructure by the Offeror.

        5. At least two (2) of the referenced solutions must have been supported by the Offeror in the capacity of a prime contractor.

      Offerors should submit each reference using the form provided in Section J, Attachment J.10. The completed forms should be returned
      directly by the referenced customers to the OCC Contracting Specialist (CS), per the information provided on the form. The forms are due to
      the OCC no later than the specified deadline for submitting proposals in response to this RFP. The OCC reserves the right to contact other
      entities not specifically identified by the Offeror in its proposal, or use other sources of information (such as published articles) and
      past performance databases to obtain past performance information.


      Please note that Past Performance references are not included in the total page count limitation.

L.10.12  Subcontracting Plan
      As part of its initial proposal, each large business Offeror shall submit a subcontracting plan as described in FAR 52.219-9. Use of the
      subcontracting plan outline included in Section J, Attachment J.15, is optional; however, plans must contain all elements included in the
      outline.


      NOTE: The OCC has FY2011 subcontracting goals of:


      Small Business – 28.5%
      SDB – 5%
      WOSB – 5%
      Hubzone – 3%
      SDVOSB – 3%

L.11  INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING THE PRICE PROPOSAL – VOLUME II
      The Offeror’s Price Proposal, should all of the details as identified in Sections B.1 and B.1.2 and Sections L.11.1 through L.11.5.


      In addition, Volume II shall include:


                    1. Signed SF 33
                    2. Section K – Representations and Certifications
                    3. Section L – OCI Disclosure/Representation Statement
                    4. Section L – Written Release for Use of Non-Government Personnel in Evaluation of Proposals or Quotations
                    5. Subcontracting Plan

                    7. Non Disclosure Agreements (for all proposed Key Personnel)

L.11.1      REQUIRED COST DATA

L.11.1.2    Cost Data for Implementation and Transition Tasks
      Using the tables provided in Section B, please provide costs for each task proposed, decomposed to the relevant CLIN level.

      Level of Detail for Labor-Hour Tasks: For labor-hour tasks, the price proposal should specify the required labor categories, associated
      hourly rates, the total number of hours each labor category will work on each task, the total cost for each labor category, and the total
      price of each task.


      Relative Level of Effort for Fixed-Price Tasks: The OCC must confirm that the appropriate skill sets are deployed in support of each task.
      Because this type of information is not otherwise available for fixed-price tasks, the Technical Approach should provide a relative level
      of effort (LOE) to describe how labor resources, identified by role, will be assigned to perform each fixed-price task. The relative LOE
      should be presented in a table, similar in format to the following:

                                                Sample Table for Fixed-Price Tasks Level of Effort
|[Task Number] [Task Name]                                                                                                                  |
|Role Name                                                                             |Relative LOE                                       |
|Project Manager                                                                       |10%                                                |
|Business Analyst                                                                      |25%                                                |

L.11.1.2.1  Discounts
      The Price Proposal should clearly indicate any discounts and any other information important to understanding the price of each task.

L.11.1.2.2  Pricing Assumptions
      Please list the pricing assumptions associated with each task proposed. If there are any pricing assumptions that relate to the entire
      scope of the project, please provide that information as well.

L.11.2      Cost Data for Hardware
      Using the tables in Section B, please provide cost data for all hardware proposed by the Offeror that will be purchased for this project.
      As described above, the costs should be identified and summarized by phase. Please provide costs at the component level for all hardware.
      Three types of hardware should be priced separately from the main components:


         ● Please price the hardware required for back-up and disaster recovery and distinguish which  components  (and  costs)  are  associated
           with each of the three levels of recoverability required in Section 7 of the ECMP Technical and Performance Requirements.

         ● Please price the  hardware  and  circuit(s)  necessary  for  establishing  the  network  connection  between  the  proposed  solution
           environment and the OCC.

         ● Please price the hardware required for storage, including both processing storage and archive storage.

L.11.2.1    Pricing Assumptions
      Please list the pricing assumptions associated with all hardware proposed.

L.11.3      Cost Data for Software
      For software licenses, please clearly distinguish between costs associated with initial license purchases and those required to maintain
      the licenses on a recurring basis. Include the initial costs in the CLINs titled “Provide software licenses required for pilot and Phase-[1-
      3] implementation” (CLINs 4, 11, 17, and 24); maintenance costs will be included in the CLINs titled “Provide software licenses maintenance
      required for pilot and Phase-[1-3] O&M” (CLINs 5, 12, 18, and 25) and “Provide software licenses maintenance required for ongoing O&M”
      (CLINs 29, 33, 37, 41, and 45). When pricing software, do not assume that any existing software licenses will be transferred to the new
      ECMP solution. Therefore, all initial license purchases should be priced as first-time purchases.


      Please consult the Tool Classification Scheme, which is Appendix A of the ECMP Technical and Performance Requirements, for the number of
      users and type of license for each tool that should be included within the ECMP solution. Please note that if a tool is not included in
      this table, it is not required by the OCC as part of the ECMP solution. The exceptions to this guidance are those tools that the Offeror
      proposes as part of its technical solution but which the OCC has neither required nor precluded. Such tools are necessitated by the ECMP
      requirements, but the OCC has not requested a specific application by name. Examples of these types of tools include the applications
      proposed by the Offeror to manage data and metadata, to track the logging of help-desk tickets and change requests, and to facilitate
      system monitoring and reporting.

L.11.3.1    Pricing Assumptions
      Please list the pricing assumptions associated with all software proposed.

L.11.4      Cost Data for O&M Tasks
      It is assumed by the OCC that O&M costs will start after the implementation of Phase 1 and scale up as additional phases of the solution
      are implemented. Using the tables provided in Section B, Offerors should provide details regarding O&M costs sufficient for the OCC to
      understand this progression, as well as the anticipated O&M costs once a steady state is achieved. Specifically, O&M costs should include
      the following:
      ● Infrastructure Services - Please provide any ongoing equipment costs, such  as  hardware  leasing  costs,  separated  by  component  and
        implementation phase.

      ● Professional and Technical Services - Please provide cost data for  each  service  required  by  the  OCC  to  support  the  implemented
        solution. Each service should be priced independently to provide visibility into the extent to which each type of service contributes to
        the overall cost of the solution. The cost data should provide the OCC with an understanding of the staffing  levels  and  staff  skills
        associated with each service.

      ● Software License Maintenance - Please provide cost data for the maintenance of software licenses for each application.  Please  indicate
        the renewal period and license type (e.g., server license or seat license).

L.11.4.1    Pricing Assumptions
      Please list the pricing assumptions associated with each O&M task/service proposed.

L.11.5      Cost Data for Travel
      To the extent possible, the OCC expects key personnel to be located within the Washington metropolitan area. In situations where one or
      more key persons do not reside within this geographic area, the OCC may consider paying the cost of these individuals’ travel in accordance
      with the Federal Travel Regulations.


      Please provide information on travel costs for any key person for whom travel is anticipated. For each task that the individual will
      support, indicate the number of trips to the OCC that are proposed. For each trip, provide the estimated costs for transportation, lodging,
      and per diem. The number of trips proposed for these individuals should be commensurate with their relative level of effort for the tasks
      they will support.

L.11.6      Price Proposal Page Limits and Formatting Requirements
      The Price Proposal is not limited in page count; however, no extraneous information (i.e., information that is not directly relevant to
      solution pricing) should be included in this proposal volume. The pages are to be 8.5 x 11 inches in size. For text appearing in the
      narrative sections of the document, the font size should be no smaller than 12 point. The font size for text appearing in the footnotes,
      captions, figures, and tables should be no smaller than 8 points. The font style is left to the Offeror’s discretion.

L.12  INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONDUCTING SOLUTION DEMONSTRATIONS
      After the determination of the competitive range, the competitive-range Offerors will be asked to demonstrate their solutions. While the
      information provided here should not be considered as the final determination of the scope of the demonstrations, Offerors should consider
      Section J, Attachment J.14 to be a reasonably accurate depiction of the features and functions to be demonstrated by Offerors. Any changes
      to the information provided in Section J, Attachment J.14 will be provided to the competitive-range Offerors at the time they receive
      notification of their eligibility to participate in the solution demonstrations. Upon receiving notice of eligibility to participate,
      competitive-range Offerors will be given six (6) weeks to prepare for their solution demonstrations.[5]


      Each competitive-range Offeror will be given one business day (a total of nine business hours, including breaks totaling 1.5 hours) to
      demonstrate the functionality described in Section J, Attachment J.14.[6] The competitive-range Offerors will draw lots to determine the
      dates of their respective demonstrations. The demonstrations will be conducted at the OCC, and the Offerors will access their demonstration
      environments via an internet connection. (Access to the OCC network is prohibited and will not be provided.)


      At the completion of the demonstrations, the OCC will apply an adjectival evaluation rating to the demonstrations. If an Offeror receives a
      marginal rating or below, the OCC reserves the right to remove the Offeror’s proposal from further consideration. Ratings from the
      demonstration will be factored into each Offeror’s final rating.


      The requirements for presenting the demonstration are as follows:


         ● All four (4) of the Offeror’s key personnel must participate in the demonstration. “Participate” means that each key person will
           execute approximately 25% of the scenarios described in Offerors may combine two or more scenarios into a single scenario wherever it
           makes sense to do so. As long as all the required scenarios are demonstrated, the Offerors are free to combine them into a smaller
           number of scenarios.

      Some scenarios need to be demonstrated to an OCC audience on the scheduled demo date. Other scenarios, because they will involve
      potentially long-running programs, will be executed offline by the Offeror’s team, with documentary evidence of the scenario’s execution to
      be brought to the scheduled demo and provided to the OCC audience. Scenarios that can be executed and documented offline are identified
      within the table below. Offerors should assume that any scenario that does not include a reference to offline execution in its supporting
      details will, by default, be demonstrated live in front of an OCC audience. (Each key person’s contribution to the demonstration must be
      roughly equivalent.) No more than six (6) individuals total may attend the demonstration from the Offeror’s proposed solution team.


         ● Each Offeror must provide an overview or summary presentation to accompany its demonstration. This presentation should provide
           clear, concise, and comprehensive coverage of the content of the demonstration at a high level. It should contain a demonstration
           script that can be followed by the attendees and mapped to the features identified in Section J, Attachment J.14. This presentation
           should not reiterate aspects of the proposal, discuss the management approach, or include marketing materials.

         ● This summary or script presentation will be in addition to the documentation required in support of individual demonstration
           scenarios. Section J, Attachment J.14 specifies, where required, the documentation requested by the OCC in support of a particular
           demonstration scenario. This supporting documentation does not need to be created in real time; that is, it can be created in advance
           of the demonstration and distributed to attendees on the day of the demonstration.

         ● The overview presentation, as well as the supporting documentation for the specified scenarios, should be provided both in
           electronic and in paper form. The paper copies of the documentation should be provided to the attendees at the start of the
           demonstration. The electronic copy of the materials should be e-mailed to the Contracts Specialist no later than 24 hours following
           the completion of the demonstration. The OCC will use this documentation, along with its observations of the executed solution
           features, to judge the quality of each Offeror’s demonstration.

         ● The Offeror should organize its demonstration so as to provide sufficient time to address any questions from the OCC. Time for
           questions and answers will be included within the total timeframe allocated for the demonstration.

         ● The Offeror should not include in its demonstration any features or functions not specifically requested by the OCC, as per the
           information provided in Section J, Attachment J.14.

         ● During the demonstration, all participants will be asked to silence their cell phones and other digital devices. If it is necessary
           to take a phone call or respond to an email message during the demonstration, participants should quietly leave the room (without
           interrupting the demonstration) to address these business needs.

      The demonstration is not an opportunity for the Offeror to obtain clarification regarding the OCC’s requirements. It is an opportunity for
      the Offeror to provide evidence of its understanding of those requirements. Therefore, during the demonstrations, the OCC will not respond
      to clarification questions regarding the demonstration nor questions related to the Technical/Price Proposals. This is to ensure that all
      Offerors are afforded fair treatment.


      Per the guidelines in Section L.10.2, Technical Approach, competitive-range Offerors will be required to submit a sample document for each
      of those deliverables identified as a fixed-price deliverable in the SOO. In lieu of a sample document, the OCC will accept detailed
      information regarding the scope of the document. These samples (or detailed information) are required to be submitted by the competitive-
      range Offerors no later than close of business (COB) on the day of the Offeror’s demonstration.


Offerors may combine two or more scenarios into a single scenario wherever it makes sense to do so. As long as all the required scenarios are
demonstrated, the Offerors are free to combine them into a smaller number of scenarios.

Some scenarios need to be demonstrated to an OCC audience on the scheduled demo date. Other scenarios, because they will involve potentially
long-running programs, will be executed offline by the Offeror’s team, with documentary evidence of the scenario’s execution to be brought to
the scheduled demo and provided to the OCC audience. Scenarios that can be executed and documented offline are identified within the table
below. Offerors should assume that any scenario that does not include a reference to offline execution in its supporting details will, by
default, is demonstrated live in front of an OCC audience.


      Please refer to Section J, Attachment J.14, ECMP Demonstration – Scope, Objections, and Evaluation Criteria

                                                                 End of Section L
SECTION M:  EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

   1. 52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)
      This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in
      full text.  The full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address:  http://acquisition.gov.




     I. FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 1) PROVISIONS


        NUMBER         DATE                  TITLE


        52.217-5            (JULY 1990)                 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS


   2. BASIS FOR AWARD
      The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government, price
      and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria below.  The best value tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101-1,
      permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or the
      highest technically rated proposal.


      To be responsive, the offeror must address all the requirements of the solicitation and must include all information specifically required
      in all sections of the solicitation.  The offeror must state how it will meet the requirements; repeating back the words of the RFP or
      responding with product sales literature is not acceptable.


      The failure of an Offeror’s proposal to meet any given requirement of the RFP may result in the entire proposal being found to be
      unacceptable and thus eliminated from the competition.  The Government intends to award a single contract.  However, no award will be made
      that is not in the best interest of the Government simply to provide coverage in task areas.


   3. UNREASONABLY LOW HOURLY RATES ON CONTRACTS
      The realism of personnel compensation rates will be part of the proposal evaluation.  Unrealistic rates, as determined by the Contracting
      Officer, will be considered in the risk assessment and may result in a reduced score.


   4. RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATION FACTORS
      (1) The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this
      solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and sub-
      factors in the solicitation. The offeror’s proposal shall be in the form prescribed by, and shall contain a response to each of the areas
      identified in the Section L solicitation instructions.

      The OCC will award a contract to the Offeror that proposes the best-value solution. This solution must conform to the stated requirements
      and be evaluated as the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the basis of award, technical merit is
      significantly more important than price; “technical merit” includes all non-price-related factors. As technical merit of proposals becomes
      more equal, the price will become more important. The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and price
      represents the greatest value to the government, price and other factors considered.


M.4.1 PROPOSAL EVALUATION FACTORS
      The following are the factors and sub-factors that will be used to evaluate Offerors’ proposals. The evaluation factors and sub-factors are
      listed in descending order of importance. In terms of relative importance, the Technical Approach is the most important factor, followed by
      the Management Approach and Risk Management, which are equally important. Additionally, Past Performance and Price are of equal importance.
      Within each factor, the first two subfactors are most important. Cumulatively, the first two subfactors within each factor are worth 50% to
      60% of the total value of the factor.


       ● Factor 1:  Technical Approach

          ○ Requirements Compliance

          ○ Performance Work Statement (PWS)

          ○ Solution Architecture

          ○ Services Provision

          ○ Service-Level Agreement (SLA)

          ○ Testing Approach




       ● Factor 2:  Management Approach

          ○ Project Management Approach

          ○ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

          ○ Staffing/Personnel Retention

          ○ Teaming Arrangements/Small-Business Subcontracting Plan

          ○ Quality Assurance Plan

          ○ Resumes




       ● Factor 3:  Risk Management

         ○ Offeror’s Explanation of the Solution Architecture with Regard to its Ability to Mitigate Risk

          ○ Risk Management Plan

          ○ Approach to User Adoption of the Solution

          ○ Exit Plan




       ● Factor 4:  Past Performance

          ○ Size, Scope, and Complexity of References

          ○ Offeror’s SAS Experience

         ○ Reference Customers’ Level of Satisfaction with Offerors’ Ability to Achieve Customers’ Solution Objectives

          ○ Relevance of References’ Business Line(s)




       ● Factor 5:  Price






      Factor 1: Technical Approach
      The Government will evaluate the suitability and fit of the Offeror’s technical
      approach—including all items as requested in Instructions to Offerors, Technical
      Approach response—with regard to the OCC environment and stated requirements; how that approach will affect the system, its users, and
      other involved parties; and the degree to which the approach applies a known, certified, documented, and repeatable process.


      Factor 2: Management Approach
      The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s ability to effectively and efficiently
      accomplish, administer, staff and manage the day-to-day operations—including all items  as requested in Instructions to Offerors,
      Management Approach response— through the use of resources, processes, techniques and tools to ensure successful completion of all tasks
      required under the contract. The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s approach to managing project organization, performance monitoring
      and control activities, contract
      performance, subcontractors and/or teaming arrangements, task management, and ensuring clear distinct lines of communication and decision-
      making authority are reflected across the program team.


      Of note, the Government will evaluate the Offeror's selection of key personnel positions and the relative role of these positions within
      the program team. The Government will evaluate the Offeror on the availability, accessibility, experience and qualifications of the
      proposed key personnel relative to the tasks specified in the SOO. The Government will evaluate the expertise and skills of proposed key
      personnel in successfully managing and delivering the services required under the contract.


      The Offeror’s subcontracting plan will be evaluated to determine whether it represents the maximum practicable opportunity for
      subcontracting. Offerors are encouraged to submit aggressive subcontracting plans and documentation which demonstrates their prior
      corporate support for small, HUBZone, small disadvantaged, women-owned, and veteran-owned businesses. The Offeror’s record of previous
      performance in carrying out the intent of the subcontracting program will be considered as approximately equal in value. Small business
      Offerors will receive the maximum rating for the factor; (small business prime contractor are exempt from the subcontracting plan
      requirements in accordance with 15 USC 637 (d)(7)).



      Factor 3:  Risk Management
      The OCC will evaluate risk management in order to assess the Offeror’s ability to mitigate risk with regard to the Solution Architecture
      (to effectively mitigate risk to improve the likelihood of project success), user adoption (lower perceived risk by the end user
      community), risk management plan (effectively identify, assess and treat risk), and exit plan (effectively transition services without
      incurring significant cost and risk).


      Factor 4:  Past Performance
      The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including
      sources outside of the Government.  Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on
      past performance, i.e., offerors lacking relevant past performance information will receive a neutral rating.  However, the proposal of an
      offeror with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the
      most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
      If an offeror fails to provide any past performance information which meets the requirements detailed in the RFP or fails to affirmatively
      state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance, the offer may not be acceptable for award.   The
      assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror to successfully
      meet the requirements of the RFP. The Past Performance factor will be used to determine the risk of non- performance, defective
      performance, and/or late performance by evaluating each offeror’s reported quality of work and relevant experience with the type of
      services being solicited.   In determining the rating for the past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater
      consideration to the references which the Government determines are most relevant to the requirements in Section C.


      Factor 5:  Price
      Price will be evaluated, but will not receive an adjectival rating.  The Government will evaluate the total price proposed to determine
      price reasonableness as it relates to the technical requirements and to assist in the best value determination. The Price Proposal will be
      evaluated for accuracy, completeness and reasonableness. The individual CLIN prices will also be evaluated to determine whether the prices
      are reasonable and balanced. The Government reserves the right to reject an offer that contains unbalanced pricing pursuant to FAR 15.404-1
      (g) (3).


      The Offeror's prices will be evaluated for technical compliance in relation to the total price, and to determine whether the proposed price
      is realistic.


      The Government will evaluate the Offeror's use of the proposed labor categories and rates. The Government will evaluate unit prices for
      materials. The Government will evaluate the fairness and reasonableness of the labor rates as compared to industry norms such as the GSA
      Federal Supply Schedule or other government-wide acquisition contracts.


M.4.2 DEMONSTRATION EVALUATION FACTORS
      The following are the factors that will be used to evaluate Offerors’ demonstrations. The evaluation factors are listed in descending order
      of importance:


               ● Use-Case Execution

               ● Alignment of Demonstrated Features with Proposed Solution

               ● Level of Solution Customization

               ● Responsiveness to OCC Questions

               ● Intuitiveness of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)


      At the completion of the demonstrations, the OCC will apply an adjectival evaluation rating to the demonstrations. If an Offeror receives a
      marginal rating or below, the OCC reserves the right to remove the Offeror’s proposal from further consideration. Ratings from the
      demonstration will be factored into each Offeror’s final rating.


M.5   DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE

      The OCC will award the contract to the Offeror of the proposal that is judged, by an integrated assessment of all the evaluation factors,
      to be the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make one award or no award, depending upon the quality of the
      proposals submitted. The OCC will not, in any case, make an award to an Offeror it considers to have substandard capabilities or
      unreasonable prices.

      If an Offeror’s proposal is determined unacceptable in any of the technical evaluation factors and/or sub-factors, the proposal may not be
      considered for award. The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest-priced Offeror.


      The Government reserves the right to make one award or no award, depending upon the quality of the proposals submitted the availability of
      funds, and the availability of funds.


      OCC will not, in any case, make award to an Offeror it considers to have substandard capabilities or unreasonable prices.


      If the offeror’s proposal is determined unacceptable in any of the technical evaluation factors and/or subfactors, the proposal may not be
      considered for award.  The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror.

                                                                 End of Section M

                                                             -----------------------
[1] TBD depending on whether solution providers propose a proprietary data store.
[2] TBD depending on whether solution providers propose a proprietary data store.

[3] Infrastructure services include any on-going costs associated with the hardware, and hardware-related software, which will be incurred by
the OCC (i.e., leasing costs). It does not include the support services listed in the following CLIN for those hardware components.
[4] For a list of requirements categorized as negotiable and the negotiable parameters of those requirements, refer to the Technical and
Performance Requirements.
[5] Given that the scope of the demonstrations may be revised during the period between the release of the RFP and the determination of the
competitive range, it is possible that additional time may be provided to prepare for the demonstration.
[6] At the time of the RFP’s release, the OCC is still determining the scope of the demonstration. Section J, Attachment J.14 reflects the OCC’s
current thinking on the matter; however, the scope of the demonstration may be modified between the release of the RFP and the determination of
the competitive range. In the event the demonstration scope is revised, an updated description of the demonstration will be released to
competitive-range vendors at the time they are notified of their inclusion in the competitive range. The amount of time allotted to prepare for
the demonstration may also be adjusted.
