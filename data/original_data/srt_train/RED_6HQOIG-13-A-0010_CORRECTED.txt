control where segregated facilities are maintained. The offeror agrees that a breach of this certification is a violation of the Equal
Opportunity clause in this contract.
2. As used in this certification, segregated facilities means any waiting rooms, work areas, rest rooms or wash rooms, restaurants or other
eating areas, time clocks, locker rooms or other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment area,
transportation, or housing facilities provided for employees that are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of
race, color, religion, or national origin, because of habit, local custom, or otherwise.
3. The offeror further agrees that (unless it has obtained identical certifications from proposed subcontractors for specific time periods) it

provisions of the Equal Opportunity clause; that it will retain these certifications in its files; and that it will forward the following notice
to these proposed subcontractors (except when they have submitted identical certifications for specific time periods):
Notice: A certification of nonsegregated facilities must be submitted before the award of a subcontract exceeding $10,000 that is not exempt
from the Equal Opportunity clause. The certification may be submitted either for each subcontract or for all subcontracts during a period
(quarterly, semiannually, or annually).

embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, or receiving stolen
property;
c. Are ___ are not ___ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in subparagraph (b) above;
d. Have ___ have not ___ within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in conjunction with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state or local)
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion or receiving stolen property; and
e. Are ___ are not ___ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of

business segment, and similar positions).
4. The offeror must provide immediate written notice to the contracting officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the offeror learns that
its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
5. A certification that any of the items in E.1 and E.2 of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered as part of the evaluation of the offeror's capability (see the Conduct Supplier
Capability Analysis topic of the Evaluate Proposals task of Process Step 2: Evaluate Sources, in the Postal Service's Supplying Practices). The
offeror's failure to furnish a certification or provide additional information requested by the contracting officer will affect the capability
evaluation.
6. Nothing contained in the foregoing may be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by E.1 and E.2 of this provision. The knowledge and information of an offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
7. This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or
fraudulent certification may render the maker subject to prosecution under section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
8. The certification in E.1 and E.2 of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making the award.
If it is later determined that the offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Postal
Service, the contracting officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.
F. Incorporation by Reference. Wherever in this solicitation or contract a standard provision or clause is incorporated by reference, the
incorporated term is identified by its title, its provision or clause number assigned to it, and its date. The text of incorporated terms may be

                                             Hybrid Contract – Firm Fixed Price and Time & Materials
                                                                   01 May 2013


I.    Introduction

   The U.S. Postal Service Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) intends to award a Hybrid contract (Firm Fixed Price and/or Time &  Materials)  to
   qualified supplier(s) with specific subject matter expertise in the area of Virtual Desktop Infrastructure.  Although the  OIG  has  suggested
   the pricing structure for each line item, Offerors should propose their best solution to include the optimal line item pricing structure.  The
   purpose of this contract is to provide the best, flexible and scalable solution and implementation for a mobile workforce.


II.   Background


   The OIG is an independent federal law enforcement agency within the U.S. Postal Service.  Its mission is to conduct  and  supervise  objective
   and independent audits, reviews, and investigations relating to Postal Service programs and operations; to promote  economy,  efficiency,  and
   effectiveness within the Postal Service; and to keep the Postal Service  Governors,  Postal  Service  management,  and  Congress  informed  of
   problems, deficiencies, and corresponding corrective actions.
   The mission of the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) is to provide vision, leadership, and objective consultation in the
   development, procurement, and deployment of secure information resource strategies, technology infrastructure, and technology-based business
   solutions which enable the OIG staff to achieve the agency mission of maintaining the accountability and integrity of the U.S. Postal Service.


III.  Scope of Work


   This Request for Proposal is to establish a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure contract for the OIG Enterprise.  The current environment at the
   OIG is approximately as follows:

    • 1600 Users Enterprise Wide with government issued laptops or desktops

    • 100 Office Locations within the United States

    • Teleworking options available for most employees

   The OIG is requesting proposals from vendors that currently provide Virtual Desktop Infrastructure solutions.  The requirements for this
   contract are as follows:

      • Provide a proposal for Virtual Desktop Infrastructure that focuses on the following Critical Success Factors:

            o Allow centralized management for corporate (OIG) and personal device options (BYOD), providing a reduction in hardware costs and
              maintenance labor hours

            o Provide a multi-faceted approach to mobility that allows for accommodation of users’ work styles and methods

            o Improve user experience

      • Based on the requirements in Attachment A, analyze OIG’s current state, design and implement a solution that fits the current needs and
        provides support for the solution to include Disaster Recovery.  If there is a requirement that the vendor deems inappropriate to the
        solution offered, a justification must be provided in the proposal.

      • The strategy should include a hybrid-approached solution for a varied workforce; those consistently in the office, those that are
        primarily teleworkers and those that alternate locations.  This hybrid approach may include Thin/Zero Client, BYOD and a small quantity
        of government issued laptops.

      • The proposal should also address storage issues and provide recommendations for a long-term storage solution.

      • Ensure that by close of FY13, the OIG Security Handbook compliant, best practices Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Plan allows for
        migration of 400 users to the new solution, and by close of FY14, the migration of the entire user population.

      • Optional: Provide additional solutions or applications that would enhance the recommended solution proposed.






IV.   Deliverables



    • Implementation solution that encompasses the requirements found in Attachment A.

    • Kick-off Meeting and follow-on notes (within 5 days of award)

    • Implementation project plan with briefing on strategy within 10 days of kick-off meeting.  The project plan should be presented in MS Excel
      format so that the OIG may incorporate it into its project management system.

    • Applicable hardware, software, licensing and maintenance included in the proposal.  Support, licensing, and maintenance should last through
      the entire period of performance.  Note: OIG reserves the right to use its own hardware if available and applicable to the solution
      presented.

    • Migration of 400 users to the new solution (by September 30, 2013)

    • Migration of the entire user population (by September 30, 2014)

    • Weekly status reports/meetings with the OCIO POC on the project progress to include a minimum of weekly updates to the project plan

    • Configuration documentation and administrator/end user manuals (by Sept 30, 2013)

    • Training and knowledge transfer for OCIO staff on all technologies implemented (by Sept 30, 2013)



V.    Period of Performance

   The contract has a period of performance that runs from the date of contract award through two calendar years.  All work  under  the  contract
   must be completed within the timeframes stated in Section IV.  At the end of the period of performance, the contract will  expire  unless  the
   OIG exercises an option period.  There are four (4) one-year option periods on this contract for continued licensing, support and maintenance.




   Invoices must be submitted before the end of the Government fiscal year in which the work is completed (30 September), even  if  a  period  of
   performance spans two or more fiscal years.  Under no circumstances will payment be made on invoices submitted after the period of performance
   closes.

VI.   Work Location and Equipment

   The supplier shall work and provide service at the OIG’s Headquarters, located  at  1735  North  Lynn  Street,  in  Arlington,  Virginia.   If
   necessary, the OIG will provide a briefing to orient the supplier’s staff to the OIG’s operations, logistics issues, systems, objectives,  and
   programs.


   The supplier shall have no expectation of privacy while using OIG office equipment, regardless of where the equipment is used.  All use of OIG-
   supplied equipment may be captured, copied, recorded, or otherwise monitored.  OIG-supplied equipment  may  be  used  only  for  OIG  business
   purposes.


VII.  Oversight

   The OIG’s Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) shall monitor overall implementation of the contract terms,  and  shall  be  assigned  to
   interact with the supplier.  The OIG may substitute a different COR to oversee the contract at any time.  The COR shall be named at  the  time
   of contract award.


VIII. Payments on Invoices for Supplier Services


   Payments shall be made on receipt of periodic, task-based invoices.  All OIG payments shall be made in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.
    The supplier shall submit original invoices for services to the OIG, Accounting Manager.  All invoices shall be reviewed  and  certified  for
   payment by the COR and other appropriate OIG-designated officials in accordance with OIG standards  and  procedures  for  approving  invoices.
   Costs for labor must be listed separately and aggregated on each invoice.  Each invoice must contain the  total  hours  cost  for  each  task.
   Invoices not submitted in the correct format shall be returned and not processed until they adhere completely to OIG  policies  and  guidance.
   Documentation and reports for each task must successfully meet OIG quality control standards prior to issuance of payment.


   The OIG will not pay the supplier’s General and Administrative (G&A) expenses.  The OIG will not  pay  for  typical  and  incidental  expenses
   incurred by the supplier, such as document reproduction outside of OIG facilities,  delivery  expenses,  and  courier  services  (unless  such
   expenses are for activities outside of the scope of customary business practices and specifically requested by the OIG).


IX.   Supplier Staffing Requirements


   The supplier must make sufficient personnel available to complete individual tasks in mutually agreed-upon timeframes.  To the extent that the
   individual tasks provide for services to be performed by specific personnel, those services must be performed by the personnel  identified  in
   the supplier's proposal or in the individual task, unless the Contracting Officer has given advance written approval for substitutes.  Use  of
   junior personnel is not authorized, even under the supervision of key personnel, unless the OIG approves of the use  of  junior  personnel  in
   writing. At the OIG’s direction, with or without cause, the supplier shall remove any personnel from performing work under  the  contract  and
   replace such personnel without any cost to the OIG.


   All personnel performing under this contract shall be considered independent  contractors,  or  subcontractors  or  employees  of  independent
   contractors, as appropriate; such personnel shall not be considered employees of the OIG or the U.S. Postal Service under any circumstances.


X.    Travel


   Travel reimbursement is not authorized under this contract. The supplier is responsible for paying all expenses related to  travel.   The  OIG
   will not reimburse the supplier for any travel expenses.




XI.   Status Reports and Progress Meetings


   The supplier may be required to provide status reports to the COR or other OIG officials, depending on the subject matter and  specific  tasks
   assigned under the contract.  The reports should detail the progress made on each assigned  task,  the  individuals  assigned  to  each  task,
   projected start and completion dates, the status of work already completed, and applicable time charges.  The supplier may also be required to
   give periodic oral presentations to accompany the status reports.  If reports are required, the OIG will schedule a meeting with the  supplier
   to detail the format of the status reports shortly after contract award; no status report will be due until at least ten  (10)  business  days
   after this meeting.  The OIG may change the status report format and content requirements at any time by written notice to the supplier.   The
   supplier may also be required to attend periodic progress meetings at OIG Headquarters.


   Any difficulties complying with timeframes and deadlines under the contract should be communicated orally to the  COR  immediately,  and  then
   documented in the next regularly scheduled status report.


XII.  Periodic Reviews


   The OIG will conduct periodic reviews of work performed by the supplier.  These reviews will assess the supplier’s  timeliness  in  completing
   tasks, the overall quality of the work product provided, and whether the deliverables provided met the task order requirements.   The  reviews
   will also assess the overall value of the work performed by the supplier.

XIV.  Security of Material and Records


   The supplier shall ensure that all individuals having access to or custody of records related to the  contract  understand  the  security  and
   confidentiality requirements of the contract.

XV.   Security, Suitability, and Background Investigation


   In order to have access to the OIG’s data, systems, or facilities, the selected supplier must have completed a background investigation within
   the past five (5) years, and must currently maintain a Secret level or higher  security  clearance  obtained  through  or  continued  by  that
   investigation.  The background investigation must be verified prior to the supplier commencing work, and the supplier must provide a  copy  of
   its security clearance to the OIG’s Personnel Security Office.  The copy of the  security  clearance  must  be  on  the  authorizing  agency’s
   letterhead, be signed by the appropriate security official, and detail the date and type of the last completed background  investigation,  the
   type of clearance granted, and the investigating agency.  A supplier who meets this requirement must also complete and  submit  the  following
   documents to the Personnel Security Office:

      • Postal Service Form 2181C (attached) – Authorization and Release – Background Investigations.
      • Postal Service Form 2025 (attached) – Contractor Questionnaire.
      • Office of Personnel Management Form SF-85-P – Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (available at: http://www.opm.gov/forms/).
      • Certification, dated within 90 days of submission, that the supplier has  passed  a  drug  screening  test  for  the  five  most  abused
        substances identified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
      • Digital photo taken from the shoulders up, preferably in front of a blue background.


   Upon receipt of these documents and successful completion of a pre-screening process, which may include a credit  and/or  criminal  background
   check, the supplier will be granted an interim security clearance, and will then be permitted to commence work.


   If the supplier does not currently possess and maintain a security clearance at Secret level or higher, then  in  addition  to  the  documents
   listed above, it will be required to complete and submit the following documents to the Personnel Security Office:


      • Proof of U.S. citizenship (copy of birth certificate or U.S. passport), copy of United States Permanent Resident Card, or copy  of  H-1B
        or student visa, as applicable.
      • Federal Bureau of Investigation Form FD-258 – two (2) Fingerprint Charts.  The fingerprint charts must be signed and  dated  by  someone
        with experience taking fingerprints.


   Upon receipt of all documents listed above, including these additional documents, the OIG  will  initiate  a  pre-screening  process  for  the
   supplier.  A supplier who is a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States will be  granted  an  interim  security
   clearance after successfully completing the pre-screening process, and will then be permitted to commence work.  A supplier who is a temporary
   resident of the United States may not commence work until receiving a full security clearance upon the successful completion of both the  pre-
   screening process and a full background investigation.
   The above requirements also apply to all subcontractors working on this contract.  All forms must be typed or handwritten legibly.

XVI.  Subcontracting

   Subcontracting of work required under the contract shall not be allowed without the prior written consent of the OIG Contracting Officer.  Any
   subcontractor must meet the same standards of conduct and independence as the supplier.  The supplier  must  cooperate  with  the  Contracting
   Officer to provide all information necessary for the Contracting Officer to make an informed decision to authorize or disapprove the  services
   of a proposed subcontractor.  Approval shall be in the form of a bilateral written modification of the  contract  issued  by  the  Contracting
   Officer.  In addition, suppliers are required to submit the  qualifications  of  the  subcontractor’s  key  personnel  with  the  request  for
   modification.


   The requirements of this contract shall extend to any subcontractors.  It shall  be  the  obligation  of  the  supplier  to  ensure  that  the
   subcontractor complies with the terms of the contract, and the supplier shall be jointly and severally liable  for  any  shortcomings  in  its
   subcontractor’s work.  Noncompete provisions and other clauses effecting a restraint of trade shall not be permitted in contracts between  the
   supplier and its subcontractors, unless prior written authorization is given by the OIG Contracting Officer.


XVII. Contract Modification


   The supplier must communicate to the COR, immediately and in writing, the occurrence of any event that may  lead  to  or  require  a  contract
   modification.  The supplier must submit any request for contract modification to the Contracting Officer and the COR, either by e-mail  or  by
   certified mail.  Only the OIG Contracting Officer may approve contract modifications.  No contract modification shall be effective  until  the
   Contracting Officer has approved the modification, in writing, and the modification has been signed by both parties.


XVIII.      Contract Termination

   The OIG reserves the right to terminate the contract with or without cause at any time during the contract period.  In the event of a contract
   termination without cause, the OIG will give 30 calendar days’ written notice informing the supplier of the  OIG’s  intent  to  terminate  the
   contract on a stated date.  After receiving such notice, the supplier shall use its best efforts to finish  any  in-progress  assigned  tasks.
   The supplier shall convey all deliverables (whether completed or in progress) to the OIG by the stated date. In the event of  termination  for
   cause, the OIG reserves the right to terminate immediately with no advance notice.


XIX.  Ownership of Work Product

   The OIG will exclusively own and hold title to all property rights in the work produced  under  this  contract,  as  well  as  all  documents,
   information, and records provided to the supplier pursuant to the contract.  The supplier shall not represent or claim that  it  has  acquired
   any right, title, or interest in the work produced or supplied under this contract.  Neither the supplier nor its personnel may sell, publish,
   copy, lend, display, or distribute the work produced or supplied under this contract to any person, without the prior written approval of  the
   Contracting Officer.


   Upon the completion or termination of the contract, or at the OIG’s request, the supplier and its personnel must promptly deliver to  the  OIG
   all work produced or supplied under this contract, including raw information and drafts, whether or not complete.

XX.   Additional Terms for Requests for Proposals:


   A. Technical and Cost/Price Proposals

   Interested suppliers should submit technical proposals addressing all stated work areas.  The proposals should be one-sided, in 12-pitch font,
