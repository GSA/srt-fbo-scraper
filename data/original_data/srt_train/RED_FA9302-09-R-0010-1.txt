(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the CCR database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

Failure to satisfy a given requirement may result in an offeror's proposal being determined non-responsive. The proposal discussion should include as much detail as possible with particular emphasis placed on demonstrating that the primary areas of concern stated in each item below is satisfied. 3.1.2 ARSU (Flight Vision Upgrade Project Specific) The purpose of this factor is to evaluate how the proposed ARSU Flight Vision Upgrade will meet the minimum requirements as outlined in the SRD. The following are the Key Performance Parameters that are essential in determining technically Acceptable or Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable ratings: 3.1.2.1 Convert Range Flight Vision KTM Systems from Analog to Digital Describe your approach to upgrading the KTM systems from the current analog camera & lens systems (sensor) to digital, High Definition progressive scan cameras and dynamic zoom lens mounted in an environmental housing. Describe your approach to provide new camera/lens (sensor) in High Definition and associated digital video equipment necessary to acquire and record Flight Vision video. 3.1.2.2 Operator Ergonomic Tracking Controller-Fixed and Mobile Describe your approach to provide an ergonomic, multi-function, control apparatus for a single operator to maneuver the KTM's (fixed and mobile) pan, tilt, lens, and camera control functions for fluid tracking of test aircraft, bomb drops, or parachute deployment. Describe your approach to provide the Operator On/Off switches to remotely enable or disable Azimuth and Elevation axis independently, to provide separate gain adjustments for Azimuth/Elevation, and adjustable tracking speed. 3.1.2.3 Operator Tracking Range Describe your approach as to how the Flight Vision HD Camera Lens will be capable of acquiring and tracking a test asset at a slant range from 3 to 40 Kilometers and acquiring and tracking aircraft to a ceiling altitude of 45,000 feet (ft). 3.1.2.4 KTM Control System Describe your approach to integrating a new ergonomic tracking control system for the new camera and lens into the existing L-3 Brashear Digital Control System (DCS) for KTM control.

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS

Describe how the implementation of conditioned power and UPS systems will interface with existing power distribution within the Operator's Shelter and to provide time to turn off KTM systems in the event of power loss from the generator. 3.1.2.7 Operator's Console/Racks Building 4785 Describe your approach to provide a new Operator's Console with associated equipment racks to house the ergonomic controller and other pertinent equipment to acquire and distribute Flight Vision High Definition video. Describe how the proposed system shall be of the same configuration and equipment as the Operator's Shelter for the Mobile systems.

This shall include consideration for a compatible control system interface and compatible ergonomic controller that may be used for both KTM and OTM. 3.2 Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Factor 2) APPLICABLE ONLY TO LARGE BUSINESS OFFERORS. Include a Subcontracting Plan containing all requirement identified at FAR 19.704 as part of your proposal submittal in response to this RFP. The Subcontracting Plan must meet all FAR 19.704 requirements to be considered acceptable. 3.3 Past Performance (Factor 3) 3.3.1 Format Use the Past Performance Information form (RFPAttch 2) for submitting relevant recent, past, and present performance. Provide a separate, thoroughly completed form for each contract submitted, including factual, concise, and clear comments regarding your performance on them. This information is required on the offeror and all subcontractors, teaming and/or joint venture partners proposed to perform a major portion of the proposed effort based on the total proposed price, or perform aspects of the effort the offeror considers critical to overall successful performance. The Government will use information provided by the offeror in this volume and information obtained from other sources in the evaluation of the Past Performance Factor. 3.3.2 All past performance should be either completed within the past three years or still in progress and have at least one year of performance history. 3.3.3 Offerors are required to thoroughly explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. Specifically relate them to the SRD. Refer to 52.212-02 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jan 1999), paragraph 5.4 for determining if the contracts you propose to submit meet the definitions of relevant. Indicate the relevancy and provide rationale for each classification using the following relevancy definitions: Very Relevant Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS FA9302-09-R-0010 PAGE -9 of

31

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS

Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. 3.3.4 Include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Merely having problems does not automatically equate to a little or no confidence rating, since the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to overcome the problems encountered. The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effect of those actions, in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified. This may allow the offeror to be considered a higher confidence candidate. For example, submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that clearly support that an offeror has overcome past problems is required. Categorize the relevant information into the specific requirements of the ARSU (Flight Vision Upgrade Project Specific) acquisition. 3.3.5 Organizational Roadmap Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant present or past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this acquisition. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination, include a "roadmap" in your past performance volume describing all such changes in the organization of your company. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any contracts you identify for past performance evaluation. Since the Government intends to consider current, recent and relevant past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offerors, your "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources. 3.3.6 Partnership Agreements If any of the contracts you identify were performed as teaming or joint venture partners, offerors must thoroughly explain the relationship of each partner, e.g. managing partner, under the contract(s) submitted, and include copies of the teaming and/or joint venture agreement(s) for these contracts. For joint venture partners, define this relationship as it relates to "populated" or unpopulated" performance of the services by each of the partners. 3.3.7 Consents Offerors are required to include written consents from their proposed subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners for the disclosure of past performance information by the Government to the offeror (prime). These written consents will facilitate the performance confidence assessment process by enabling the Government to clarify (FAR 15.306(a)(2) and, if necessary communicate and/or discuss (FAR 15.306(b) and (d), subcontractor, teaming partner, and/or joint venture partner past performance information with the offeror (prime) (Attachment 3). 3.4 Price Volume (Factor 4) 3.4.1 Price Reasonableness and Affordability These instructions are to assist you in submitting information other than cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness of your proposed price. It is anticipated that pricing of this action will be based on adequate price competition. Compliance with these instructions is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your proposal. Note that unrealistically low or high proposed prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an

unrealistic proposal. Offers should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness. The burden of proof for credibility of proposed prices rests with the offeror. 3.4.2 Complete Blocks 17a, 30a, 30b, 30c, of SF 1449. In doing so, the offeror accedes to the contract terms and conditions as written in the entire RFP. 3.4.3 Complete unit prices for CLINs 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, and 0005 of the Price Schedule. CLIN 0006 is a Government estimate and is NOT to be priced at contract award. CLIN 0007 price will be determined from the completed Exhibit B of the proposal which will be used to price task orders when/if the need arises. See Exhibit B for specific instructions on the completion of the Exhibit. Ensure all rounded unit prices, extended amounts and totals are correct. 3.4.4 Do not submit any other pricing, e.g. information other than pricing data such as pricing worksheets or spreadsheets, manpower labor costs, etc. In accordance with FAR 15.403-3(a), information other than cost or pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness. 3.4.5 As mentioned above offerors are not required to submit certified cost or pricing data. However, if after receipt of proposals it is determined that adequate price competition does not exist, cost or pricing data (see FAR 15.406-2, Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data) shall be required. If it is determined that adequate price competition does not exist, the offeror shall provide current, complete and accurate cost or pricing data within 10 calendar days after receipt of the Contracting Officer's request. 3.5 Contract Documentation 3.5.1 Contract/Representations and Certifications Under this volume, the offeror shall provide required contract documentation, supporting information and any exceptions to the RFP. 3.5.2 Narrative Summary This volume shall include a concise narrative summary of the entire proposal, including significant risks, and a highlight of any key or unique features, excluding price. The salient features should tie in with evaluation factors/subfactors.

This same information must be provided if the work for this contract will be performed at any other location(s). List all locations where work is to be performed and indicate whether such facility is a division, affiliate, or subcontractor, and the percentage of work to be performed at each location. 3.6 Determination of Competitive Range (a) Pursuant to FAR 15.306, the Contracting Officer's determination of competitive range of proposals submitted as a result of this solicitation will consider such criteria as technical evaluation, subcontracting plan (if applicable), past performance, price proposed, and other items evaluated from this solicitation. See Provision 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items, for a definitive listing of the evaluation criteria and their relative importance. (b) Offerors are hereby advised that only those proposals determined to have a reasonable chance for award of a contract will be included in the competitive range. While every effort will be made to maintain strong competition, the Contracting Officer will also look to eliminate time consuming and unnecessary discussions with those offerors whose proposals have no reasonable chance for award. This procedure is considered beneficial to both the Air Force and the offerors involved since, in addition to saving further expenditure of resources, acquisition lead time should be reduced. (c) Accordingly, offerors should submit initial proposals on their most favorable terms, from both a technical and price standpoint. Again, it should be noted that proposals will not be included in the competitive range solely on the basis of technical acceptability, nor will they be included due to price considerations alone. (d) Offerors whose proposals are not included in the competitive range will be notified as soon as practicable. Additional information relative to such proposals will be provided through debriefing of unsuccessful offerors.

(End of Provision) 2. FAR 52.212-02 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jan 1999) 1.0 This will be a Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) source selection which will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), and Air Force Materiel Command Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS

(AFMCFARS). These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FAR Site: http://farsite.hill.af.mil. One contract may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements, and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors, to represent the best value to the Government using the trade-off process at FAR 15.101-1. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms, conditions, representations, certifications, technical requirements (reference AFFARS 5315.305(a)), and be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (reference DFARS 252.204-7004). Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the offeror being removed from consideration for selection. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. Any exception and rationale shall be part of Volume V Contract Documentation and will not be reflected in any other volumes of the proposal response. 1.1 The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Air Force satisfactory confidence, or greater, that they will best meet the requirements affordably. This may result in an award to other than the lowest priced offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors. To arrive at a source selection decision, the Source Selection Authority (SSA) will integrate the source selection team's evaluations of the factors and subfactors described at paragraph 2 below. While the Government source selection evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective, and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. The Government may: a. Award one or no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposal(s) submitted. b. Reject proposals that are evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposals are deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program. The Government will: (1) Consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency that is discovered. The judgment of such correctional potential is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range. (2) Evaluate considerations which will include proposed contractual terms and conditions; and, the results of past performance surveys or other capability/capacity reviews. 2.0 Evaluation Factors and Subfactors Award will be made to the offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and subfactors described below. The evaluation factors are listed below: Factor 1: Mission Capability -- Within the Mission Capability factor, there are nine subfactors, of which are of equal importance. Factor 2: Subcontracting Plan Factor 3: Past Performance Factor 4: Price 2.1 Evaluation Methodology The Government will first evaluate all offeror proposals for technical acceptability of Factor 1 Mission Capability as shown in paragraph 3.0 below. The Government will then evaluate all Large Business offerors for acceptability of their Subcontracting Plan as shown in paragraph 4.0 below. All offerors receiving a rating of Acceptable or Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable will be further evaluated for Past Performance Factor 3 shown at paragraph 5.0 below, and Price Factor 4 shown at paragraph 6.0 below. 2.2 Relative Order of Factor Importance

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS FA9302-09-R-0010 PAGE -13 of

31

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS

Factors 1 and 2 (Subcontracting Plan applicable to Large Business Only) are pass/fail and as such are equally important for an offer to be further considered for award. Of the remaining Factors, Past Performance Factor 3 will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal in importance to Price Factor 4. 3.0 Factor 1: Mission Capability The Government will initially evaluate the offeror's Mission Capability proposal for the following key performance parameter Subfactors 1 through 9 on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. In addition, offerors must meet ALL requirements of the Statement of Work to obtain a rating of technically Acceptable or Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable. 3.1 Convert Range Flight Vision KTM Systems from Analog to Digital The offeror's proposed approach has shown the capability to upgrade the KTM system from the current analog camera & lens systems (sensor) to digital, High Definition progressive scan cameras and dynamic zoom lens mounted in an environmental housing. The offeror's proposal adequately describes an approach to provide new camera/lens (sensor) in High Definition and associated digital video equipment necessary to acquire and record Flight Vision video. 3.2 Operator Ergonomic Tracking Controller-Fixed and Mobile The offeror's proposed approach has shown the capability to provide an ergonomic, multifunction, control apparatus for a single operator to maneuver the KTM's (fixed and mobile) pan, tilt, lens, and camera control functions for fluid tracking of test aircraft, bomb drops, or parachute deployment. The offeror's proposed approach has shown the system can provide the Operator On/Off switches to remotely enable or disable Azimuth and Elevation axis independently, have separate gain adjustments for Azimuth/Elevation, and adjustable tracking speed. 3.3 Operator Tracking Range The offeror's proposed approach shows the capability that the Flight Vision HD Camera Lens shall be capable of acquiring and tracking a test asset at a slant range from 3 to 40 Kilometers and acquiring and tracking aircraft to a ceiling altitude of 45,000 feet (ft). 3.4 KTM Control System The offeror's proposed approach has shown that the new ergonomic tracking control system for the new camera and lens can be integrated into the existing L-3 Brashear Digital Control System (DCS) for KTM control. The described approach demonstrates the offeror understands the full capabilities and functions of the DCS in order to properly interface the functions of the DCS. 3.5 Convert Umbilical Cabling Connecting KTM Mount to Operator's Shelter from Copper to Fiber-optic The offeror's proposed approach has shown the Flight Vision modifications include a mounted KTM Camera, Lens, Pan/Tilt control that is interfaced to the Operator's Shelter or Building 4785 via fiber-optic cabling, replacing the current copper umbilical cabling from KTM to Operator's Shelter/Console. 3.6 Operator's Shelter Equipment Racks and Power The offeror's proposed approach has shown the capability to provide conditioned power and UPS systems to facilitate clean power to the Operator's Shelter system equipment and provide time to turn off KTM systems in the event of power loss from the generator. 3.7 Operator's Console/Racks Building 4785 The offeror's proposed approach has shown the capability to provide a new Operator's Console with associated equipment racks to house the ergonomic controller and other pertinent equipment to acquire and distribute Flight Vision High Definition video. The offeror's proposed approach has shown the capability that the proposed system shall be of the same configuration and equipment as the Operator's Shelter for the Mobile systems. The offeror's proposed approach has shown the capability for proper power distribution and grounding into the Operator's console and equipment racks. 3.8 Digital Video Recorder The offeror's proposed approach has adequately described how the acquisition of Flight Vision High Definition video shall be recorded in full-band HD formats onto a removable disk array for a minimum recording time of 1 hour (uncompressed) that can be hand carried from the range back to Ridley Mission Control Center for playback and any further analysis.

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS

3.9 Building 4785 Optical Tracking Mount (Optional) The offeror's proposed approach has shown the capability to provide a migration path toward a new Optical Tracking Mount (OTM) at Building 4785, to include consideration for a compatible control system interface and compatible ergonomic controller that may be used for both KTM and OTM. 4.0 Factor 2: Subcontracting Plan (Applicable to Large Business Offerors Only). If the offeror is a large business, the offeror must submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan, submitted in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The Government will evaluate the plan to determine if it meets all FAR 19.704 requirements, on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. Failure to submit such a plan (When Required) may render the offeror ineligible for award. 5.0 Factor 3: Past Performance Evaluation/Methodology. 5.1 The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the efforts described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. When completed, the assessment will result in an overall performance confidence assessment for Factor 3 as shown below:

PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS Rating Description SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. LIMITED CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. 5.2 The performance assessment rating will be based upon an assessment of performance risk, and represents the Government's confidence in the offeror's probability of successfully performing as proposed. The Government will evaluate the past performance focusing on performance that is relevant to the Mission Capability subfactors. In addition to Mission Capability requirements, the past performance assessment will consider relevant performance on such things as, but not limited to, the offeror's history of adhering to schedules (including the administrative aspects of performance), price, reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, quality, and the contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. Pursuant to DFARS 215.305(a)(2), the assessment will also consider the extent to which the offeror's past performance demonstrates compliance with FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan (if applicable). 5.3 The performance evaluation may include data on relevant current and/or recent efforts performed by other divisions, corporate management, subcontractors, teaming and/or joint venture partners, or the relevant element of predecessor entities forming new companies by merger/consolidation, if such resources will be brought to bear or significantly influence the performance of the proposed effort. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS FA9302-09-R-0010 PAGE -15 of

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS

rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably in accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv).

5.4 Relevant. Relevant performance is defined as performance of efforts that are similar or greater in magnitude and complexity relative to the Key Performance Parameters shown at paragraphs 3.1 through 3.9 above. The Government may consider as relevant those efforts performed for agencies of the federal, state, or local governments and commercial customers. A strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than no identifiable record of past performance. Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance. In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP. 5.5. Current and Recent. Current contracts are those active, on-going contracts with a performance record of at least one year. Recent contracts are those completed within the past three years from the issue date of this solicitation. More recent and relevant performance, which have an actual measurable performance record, will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than less recent effort. 5.6 Adverse past performance information is information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation aspect or any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system. Where relevant performance record indicates adverse performance information, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness. 5.7 Past performance information may be obtained through the Past Performance Information and Retrieval System (PPIRS), Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), similar systems of other Government departments and agencies, questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of this acquisition, Defense Contract Management Command (DCMC) channels, interviews with program managers and contracting officers, and other sources known to the Government. Offerors are to note that, in conducting this assessment, the Government reserves the right to use both data provided by the offeror and data obtained from other sources. 5.8 Obtaining Past Performance Information. The Government will seek to obtain relevant performance information on all offerors (whose proposals are determined technically Acceptable or Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable) using a completed Past Performance Questionnaire, based on the Past Performance Information (RFP Attch 2) provided by the offeror.

6.0 FACTOR 4: PRICE 6.1 After the Government evaluates proposals under Mission Capability Factor 1 and Subcontracting Factor 2 and the offeror has received a technical rating of Acceptable or Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable for both these factors, the Offerors will then be evaluated by price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by evaluation of the proposed unit and total price for CLINs 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, 0005, and for CLIN 0007 from Exhibit B of the RFP. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.

SOLICITATION PROVISIONS

6.2 The Government may use pricing information furnished by other Government sources or the Independent Government Estimate (IGE) in evaluating the reasonableness of the proposed price in addition to any pricing data submitted. 6.3 If the lowest priced evaluated technically acceptable offer is judged to have a Satisfactory performance confidence assessment or higher, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offerors. 6.4 The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of Limited Confidence or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision. 6.5 Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in RFP provision 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision. 6.6 The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. 6.7 A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) Advanced Range System Upgrade (ARSU) plans to modernize Range Optics Flight Vision video systems. ARSU is an Improvement and Modernization (I&M) program aimed at enhancing AFFTC Flight Vision capabilities by integrating modern digital high definition camera and lens to ground-based optical tracking mounts, and provide Range Video with a capability to encode metadata for future data and asset management archiving. This approach will replace the current analog video infrastructure, which has reached the end of its lifecycle. ARSU seeks to provide a high-quality video product to the Test and Evaluation (T&E) community at the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) Edwards AFB, CA. The System Requirements Documents (SRD) defines the capabilities needed by the AFFTC for both mobile and fixed Flight Vision digital systems. Once the capabilities are established, the SRD will be used to generate one or more RFPs needed to implement the system. The following material establishes the system requirements for the Range Flight Vision Video Upgrade being developed by the ARSU Program.

1.2 Scope
Current Range Flight Vision Systems are ground-based and used to locate and track aerial test assets for mission analysis. Test assets consist of manned and unmanned aircraft, bomb deployment from aircraft (aerial release to ground impact), and parachute deployment (aerial release to landing). This document presents the system requirements for the Flight Vision tracking systems. Included are system requirements for field acquisition of Flight Vision missions. Some features of the ARSU Upgrade will satisfy various mission requirements such as situational awareness/surveillance imagery and downrange video support of operations at the AFFTC. The upgrade to the Flight Vision subsystems includes providing the current L-3 Brashear Kineto Tracking Mounts (KTM) with new remote tracking and control systems. Future upgrades will include transporting high definition video from the Flight Vision systems from downrange for display, recording, editing, retrieval and cataloging, situational awareness, and range safety for the Mission Control Rooms and other mission essential personnel. Another future option shall consist of an upgrade from a temporary KTM integration at Building 4785 fixed site to a permanent Optical Tracking Mount (OTM) using the current KTM equipment infrastructure.

Currently, the Range ground based instrumentation uses manually controlled Kineto Tracking Mounts (KTM) from L-3 Brashear. The current system consists of analog cameras and aging optics to provide customers with flight vision video and situational awareness imagery. The analog systems are soon to be transitioned to digital systems and migration to high definition, progressive scan imagery is the desired end-state. The ARSU Range imaging and display system upgrade program will significantly change current Range Video configuration to migrate from analog to digital video. This SRD will focus on conceptual applications for upgrading the Range Flight Vision Systems to capture range video rich media assets, with associated metadata, and consideration toward migration paths, adaptability, and scalability for future system enhancements as newer technology evolves.

2.2 System Definition
Existing Flight Vision systems consists of a live video feed of an event (with back up recording on a VHS tape, DVD or HDD) using analog NTSC standard definition video. The ARSU Flight Vision modernization effort will enhance the video product delivered to the Range customer in various ways. Image resolution, frame rate, noise immunity, storage media and archiving/retrieval of the video product will be superior to the current analog systems. In addition to the video product improvements, the work flow through which customers receive their video may also change dramatically, going from a baseband video switching architecture (analog) to a digital network-centric layout, using a Conditional Access system for video distribution. Future requirements for transporting of classified video may use a National Security Agency (NSA) approved encryption device. Video created by the upgraded system will contain acquisition metadata and input KTM graphic data (Azimuth, Elevation, and IRIG-B Time Code) onto the display, covering various mission parameters, allowing for easy archiving and retrieval of a certain video file post mission using Conditional Access (CA). The end-to-end solution such as the implementation of Digital Data Asset Management (DDM) systems to ingest, annotate, store, and access imagery generated from the KTM/Fight Vision Systems

FA9302-09-R-0010 ATTACHMENT 1

needs to integrate with the current analog Ridley Master Control Center and South Base Video Control Centers (VCCs). The objective system shall consider legacy formats where applicable, and provide conversion to allow continued use of legacy analog sources for the older generation Mission Control Rooms (MCRs). The system shall be scalable to provide future additions as detailed requirements are determined. The SRD will encompass the overall concept of the proposed system so the potential contract vendor will understand the full intent of the ARSU for Range Optics Flight Vision systems. As this upgrade will be done in a phased approach, the responses shall be for Phase 1 only.

Figure 1 Phase I Configuration

2.2.1 Mobile Kineto Tracking Mount (KTM) with Trailer The proposed Improved and Modern Flight Vision system will originate with the current Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) L-3 Brashear Kineto Tracking Mount system (Figure 2). The Brashear L3 Kineto Tracking Mount (KTM) systems provide the base platform for servo controlled tracking mounts for the cameras. These systems are primarily mobile, yet one system will be temporarily located at fixed site Building 4785. The KTM systems will require an upgrade from the current analog camera and lens systems (sensor) to digital, High Definition progressive scan cameras and dynamic zoom lens. These new control systems will be integrated into the existing Digital Control System (DCS) that is the primary controller for the KTM. The Range Flight Vision systems are typically mounted at locations where there is a vast field of view of flight or mission operations. The KTM is remotely controlled by a nearby operator's tracking control system in the Operator's Shelter co-located with the KTM.

FA9302-09-R-0010 ATTACHMENT 1

Figure 2 Refurbished KTM

The typical KTM System is a self-contained, trailer-mounted, direct-torque-driven elevation over azimuth mount. The KTM is designed to provide smooth, jitter-free motion for optical, video data acquisition and tracking of a variety of targets. The unit is operated by the Digital Control System (DCS) chassis. The DCS receives external designation via Ethernet communication which provides the internal positioning of the line of sight (LOS).
2.2.1.1 Tracking Mount Component

The tracking mount includes the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ Stationary Base Assembly Azimuth Carriage Assembly Elevation Tracking Assembly

The stationary base supports the azimuth carriage bearing assembly. It carries the complete tracking mount. The azimuth carriage assembly consists of continuous rotating position of the mount. This includes the trunion standard which supports the elevation tracking assembly. The elevation tracking assembly includes the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ Payload Support Mounting Structures Fine Level (10 arc seconds) Axis Converter Module

FA9302-09-R-0010 ATTACHMENT 1

Digital Control System The DCS is a digital motion that controls the KTM azimuth and elevation motors for acquisition and target tracking. Trailer Assembly The trailer assembly contains three built-in, dual-speed electrical jacks for fine-leveling the trailer, an air-conditioning system to supply cool air into the electronic bay, and 3-phase AC power to the KTM. System Interfaces The primary interfaces used in the KTM System consist of internal and external interfaces and a DCS chassis. ˇ Internal Interfaces

The DCS is a two-axis proportional-integral-derivative (PID) rate loop control system with various safety features and controls. It is designed to be a standalone module with simple wiring interfaces to customer power, motors, switches and indicators. ˇ External Interfaces

The KTM unit is operated by the DCS chassis. The DCS receives external designation via Ethernet communication which provides the internal positioning of the LOS. ˇ Software

The DCS GUI software provides feedback compensator and filter design based on common tuning parameters for rigid body systems with torque control input and position feedback. Results can be evaluated using common frequency response plots. See Appendix C for more information on KTM. 2.2.2 Fixed Building Kineto Tracking Mount-Temporary The Fixed Building 4785 assembly shall share the same features as the mobile KTMs. The Fixed Building KTM is located at Building 4785. This KTM shall be upgraded for the same enhancements as the Mobile KTMs to allow for continuity and similarity between equipment and operator control ergonomics. The Fixed Building KTM will be a temporary integration until a future enhancement for a permanent fixed Optical Tracking Mount (OTM) option. Once the OTM is in place and functioning, the temporary KTM will join the mobile KTM pool for use in downrange missions. The fixed KTM at Building 4785 for temporary installation will be GFE. 2.2.3 Operator's Shelter & KTM Support Equipment-Mobile The Mobile Operator's Shelters accommodate the associated mobile KTM with trailer assembly and are currently wired via copper cable to connect the two. One aspect of the upgrade will convert the copper umbilical cable to fiber-optic cable to allow variable extension of distance from the KTM trailer mount to the Operator's Shelter. The intent is to place the KTM closer to objective test assets while keeping the tracking operators at safer distances.

FA9302-09-R-0010 ATTACHMENT 1

The shelter shall contain the necessary equipment and infrastructure to provide the tracking operator with ergonomic control over the KTM and attached camera/lens sensors (Figure 3). The ergonomic control for the Flight Tracking Operator is one of the key features to address in this upgrade. The Prime Movers, Operator Shelters, and generators will be GFE.

Figure 3 Operator Shelter

2.2.4 Operator's KTM Support Equipment-Fixed Building 4785 The Operator's KTM Support Equipment located in Building 4785 will not require the mobile environmental shelter as do the mobile KTM systems. This system's equipment will be located within Building 4785 and will require a new operator's console and any new equipment racks necessary to house the KTM Support Equipment. The KTM Support Equipment at the fixed site shall contain the necessary equipment and infrastructure to provide the tracking operator with ergonomic control over the KTM and attached camera/lens sensors. The ergonomic control for the Flight Tracking Operator is one of the key features to address in this upgrade. The fixed system shall require the replacement of copper umbilical cable with fiber-optic cable from the KTM to the Support Equipment. The KTM is GFE. Contractor shall be responsible to access local power, distribute conditioned power within racks/consoles, and properly ground the new console and new equipment racks. 2.2.5 Fixed Building 4785 Optical Tracking Mount-Permanent The initial installation for Flight Vision at Building 4785 (See 2.1.2 Fixed Building 4785 Kineto Tracking Mount-Temporary) is to upgrade the KTM for temporary use at Building 4785. The KTM will be replaced by a permanent, fixed Optical Tracking Mount (OTM) option and the KTM may be retasked to the Mobile KTM pool with all of the standard enhancements implemented. 2.2.6 Video Transport Network from Range Sites (Future) Most of the range sites that have been chosen for the Range Video Flight Vision such as C-1, C-5, and C-7 have available power (local or generated) and fiber-optic cable. Range Flight Vision will use the

FA9302-09-R-0010 ATTACHMENT 1

available fiber-optics to transport to the aggregation site at Downfall where the video will map onto the network equipment to connect to Ridley Video Command and Control (VCC) and Mission Control Rooms (MCR). 2.2.7 Downfall Site Range Video Aggregation Point (Future) The Downfall Site is where downrange monitoring of Operations and Maintenance activities occur. Most of the sites chosen for Range Flight Vision have fiber-optic cable and power available. These sites will bring the Flight Vision Range Video to a common aggregation point located at the Downfall Site on the range. The Downfall site will take a local monitoring feed from the down range sites where the Flight Vision systems sites are located. The Downfall Site will have the network equipment to place the Range Flight Vision video onto transport for backhaul to the Ridley Building 1440 and South Base Building 145 infrastructures. 2.2.8 Video Command & Control -Ridley Bldg 1440 (Future) The Video Command and Control (VCC) Subsystem at Ridley Building 1440 will act as "traffic police" from capture to distribution to acquisition and final cataloging of the range video content. Incoming source video will require administration of network switching to ensure video inbound paths are properly working and provide a means for quality control monitoring, The Command and Control System is responsible for monitoring alarms or certain conditions which may require special attention to avoid impact on the video system performance. Problems may be analyzed before they occur, so the appropriate personnel can correct it in a reasonable time before it becomes a greater issue. In some cases, it is almost impossible to anticipate severe conditions such as power failures or a cut in the fiber-optics, but the Command and Control System would have a capability to notify professionals immediately to remedy the problem. 2.2.9 Video Command & Control-South Base Bldg 145 (Future) The South Base VCC Subsystem located at Bldg 145 acts as an extension of Ridley Building 1440 VCC for South Base Mission Control Rooms. The South Base VCC directs the Range Video traffic to the South Base Mission Control Rooms. 2.2.10 Digital Data Management-Ridley Bldg 1440 (Future) Located at Ridley Mission Control Center in Building 1440 will be a Digital Data Management system that will archive the Range Video rich media assets.

2.3 User Characteristic
The ARSU Range Video System Upgrade will be capable of providing end-to-end high resolution digital video support for flight test needs. The involvement and dedication of the Range, from the Range Control Officer (RCO), Range Safety Office, the operators, engineering, the O&M staff and analysts are key to the successful implementation of the ARSU Range Video System Upgrade capabilities.

All equipment and software will be compliant with procedures and processes related to the Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP), DoDI 8510.01. There are several key considerations that will affect the choice of equipment and design layout of the ARSU upgrades. Distance between the Flight Vision camera/lens and target aircraft promote visual aberrations due to a combination of weather (scintillation, blowing dust, clouds etc.) and intervening geographical obstructions and harsh environmental conditions. Missions can occur during either dawn, day, dusk, or night and can create various problems with ambient lighting conditions. Many of these issues will be addressed through the evaluation of design options and close coordination with all stakeholders.

Appendix B ­ Glossary
Digital Assets Digital assets are electronic files in a multitude of formats including graphics, photographic images, audio files, and video files. They are typically used as part of a corporate identity program or for product marketing. Many are associated with past events and have a historical value. The primary components of a Digital Data Management System (Asset Management) are the repository where the assets are stored, the database where the information about the assets is stored, and the user interface. Workflow is a key function layered on top of these components that manages the processes through which the assets move. The term is used in contrast to media which only utilize traditional forms of printed or hand-produced text and still graphics. In general, rich media or multimedia includes a combination of text, audio, still images, animation, video, interactivity content forms and associated metadata. Rich media usually requires more storage and is more bandwidth intensive than ordinary text such as video, computer displays, radar displays, SA displays, power point presentations, still pictures etc. Abbreviated as CA, in digital television broadcasting, conditional access is the term used to describe a system of allowing users access to only those services for which they have subscribed.

            Past performance information concerning subcontractors and teaming partners cannot be disclosed to a private party without the

      the Government in assessing your past performance relevancy and confidence, we request that the following consent form be completed by the
      major subcontractors/teaming partners identified in your proposal.  The completed consent forms should be submitted as part of your Past
      Performance Volume.

                                                                      SAMPLE
