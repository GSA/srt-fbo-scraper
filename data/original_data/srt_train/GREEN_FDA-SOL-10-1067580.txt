Background and Purpose

FDA researchers require access to CSA Biological Sciences Database, providing access to a suite of abstracts and citations to a wide range of
research in biomedicine, biotechnology, zoology and some aspects of agriculture and veterinary science.   The unlimited online meets the
information needs of FDA researcher’s and ensures they have access to the information they require to do their work. These resources are highly
valued and used by FDA researchers in support of the Agency mission as evidenced by usage statistics.

The requirements for the services are provided below:

1.0  Scope and Requirements

1. The FDA Biosciences Library requires unlimited online web access, to a select group of core resources based on IP authentication.  They are
   available 24/7 at the researcher’s desktop.
1. The resources include the following areas:


Supporting over two dozen areas of expertise, this CSA database provides access to literature from over 6000 serials, as well as conference
proceedings, technical reports, monographs and selected books and patents.

Note: subscribers to this database also have complimentary access to Biology Digest, Conference Papers Index, rolling 10-year file of MEDLINE,
Plant Science, and a rolling 5-year file of TOXLINE.

2. Specific Requirements

2.1 The FDA requires unlimited online access to a suite of abstracts and citations to a wide range of research in biomedicine, biotechnology,
agriculture and veterinary science

2.2   For the above, the contractor shall provide the following:

a.  A site license for 24/7 desktop web access for Agency wide based on IP authentication.
b.  Customer service shall be available to troubleshoot website/connectivity issues via phone, email, etc.
c.  Researchers and librarians need access to all of the resources and must be able to search selected resources with one query and one
interface.
d.  Customers require a single access interface to search across multiple resources.  This type of simultaneous searching reduces the need for
multiple searches and saves the agency researcher’s research time and the cost of purchasing multiple print subscriptions through various
contractors.


3.0  Description of Work

3.1   The contractor shall provide the FDA Biosciences Library a search platform on their server. Database includes a compilation of abstracts
in the subject areas of biomedicine, biotechnology, zoology and some aspects of agriculture and veterinary science. Further, we will have
complimentary access to Biology Digest, Conference Papers Index, rolling 10-year file of MEDLINE, Plant Science, and a rolling 5-year file of
TOXLINE.

 We prefer to search across one platform rather than multiple platforms.  This method provides a more efficient, time and cost savings manner
for FDA researchers by saving of overall search time necessary for finding necessary information and performing the research work necessary to
meet the mission of FDA.
The contractor is expected to troubleshoot access as needed, but it will not be necessary to respond during non-operational hours as defined
above.


3.2  Deliverables:

3.2.1 The interface is hosted on the contractor’s server via IP access

      Usage statistics are available on a monthly basis with a userid and password.



4.  Period of Performance

1/1/2010 to 12/31/2010


5. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act
The following Section 508 standards are applicable to this requirement (See Clause).

§ 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.


§ 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.
