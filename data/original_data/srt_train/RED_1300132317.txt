                                                      Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility
                                                         Strip Chart Recorder/Workstation

A. Background

The Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility is upgrading the testing capability in the Rotor Spin Facility (RSF).  The RSF consist of four test
chambers for conducting T&E of gas turbine engine rotating components.  Each test chamber control system requires a strip chart
recorder/workstation for real time display of critical operating parameters for test article monitoring and tracking of test progress and the
protection of RSF equipment and test article.
