Be advised that 18 U.S.C. §641 provides, in pertinent part, as follows: Whoever...steals, purloins, or knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys or disposes of any record...or thing of value of the United States or of any department or agency thereof...Shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both. b. All information, as described in paragraph (a) that is made available to [name of company], its employees, subsidiaries, and agents in the course of performing the services sought through this contract, whether or not that information was directly or intentionally communicated, is confidential unless otherwise indicated in writing. [name of company], its employees, subsidiaries, and agents shall not use, disclose or knowingly permit to be disclosed either orally, in writing, or by electronic means to any person (except those employees, subsidiaries, or agents who need to know the information for the purposes of this contract) any such information without the prior written consent of the NTSB. c. [name of company] shall use its best efforts to prevent any disclosure of any confidential information to any third party and use at least the same care and discretion that it uses with similar data it designates as confidential. d. In the event of any material breach of confidentiality by [name of company], the contract will become void at the NTSB's option, at which time [name of company] will forfeit any payment and return 1) all monies paid under this contract to the NTSB and 2) any and all data collected or generated up to that point in performance of work for the NTSB. The NTSB will determine materiality of breach. The NTSB does not waive any other legal recourse available to the agency or the United States. e. [name of company] will not act at any time as a consultant or provide opinion or expert testimony for any person or entity other that the NTSB on any matter related to the services performed under this contract.

a. The ordering Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), or Contracting Officer are neither aware of any organizational conflicts of interest that may exist with respect to the company accepting work as a result of this Contract, nor is the Contracting Officer aware of any organizational conflicts of interest that may exist with respect to any employees of the company performing the services described in the contract.

The Contractor agrees that if an actual, apparent or potential OCI is discovered after award, the Contractor will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual, apparent or potential conflict. d. Remedies ­ If the Government discovers an actual or potential conflict after award, it may terminate this contract (and any task orders issued hereunder) for convenience, in whole or in part. If the government deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI prior to award, no award will be made. If the Contractor did not disclose relevant information or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the government may terminate the contract for default, debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--

(1) Are, are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;

(2) Have, have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(3) Are, are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) Have, have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

Page 26 of 29

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. § 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

National Transportation Safety Board SECTION C - Statement of Work Digital Asset Management Software and Installation/Training Services
1.0 BACKGROUND The NTSB seeks a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software solution capable of providing a centralized, secure, and multi-faceted software solution to store digital evidence in the form of photos, videos, and audio files. Although, initial use of the software will focus on the centralization of photo management it is anticipated that centralized storage and management of other digital items will closely follow. Implementation of this solution will serve to improve evidence handling, reduce storage demand for photos and ensure that all applicable photos are properly managed throughout their life cycle. By providing centralized management of photos and other digital assets the NTSB will improve internal operating efficiencies in conducting mission and support activities such as accident investigations, advocacy on safety issues, public relations, responses to FOIA requests and other routine functions 2.0 SCOPE OF WORK The Contractor shall provide all software, labor and materials to implement its COTS solution to be fully functional and to meet the requirements of this SOW, including testing and demonstration, and provide training to NTSB users. The Contractor shall also provide software maintenance in the form of upgrades and technical support. 3.0 SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY AND FEATURES The following is a list of desired software solution system functionality and features: REQUIREMENT Security/User Rights/Licensing 1. Photo Authentication is a mandatory requirement. The system must have the ability to Authenticate digital Jpeg or Camera RAW digital photo files produced by digital cameras. By "Authentication" we specifically mean the examination of the photos at the time it is imported into the system to look for signs that the photos were edited by photo editing software PRIOR to import into the system and PRIOR to acquisition of the photo into the system. If no signs of editing were found the system needs to indicate that the photo passed Authentication. Authentication must be able to determine the known camera model that produced the photo file to be imported and that the photo file does or does not show signs that it has been altered by photo editing software between when the camera took the photo and when the photo is imported into the computer. Authentication must be able to work with multiple brands of cameras to allow our agency a choice of

Section C, Statement of Work dated 8/23/2011 Page 1 of 9

REQUIREMENT brands including, but not limited to, cameras from Nikon, Canon, Agfa, Pentax, Contax, Epson, Kodak, FujiFilm, HP, Konica Minolta, Kyocera, Leica, Olympus, Ricoh, Samsung, Sanyo, Sigma, Casio, SONY, Toshiba, Panasonic. 2. System must have an audit trail. The audit trail should include tracking all persons (using login and password) who accessed the system/file and the actions performed (print, view, etc.). All audit trail items must be time stamped with a time based on a hardware based tamperproof trusted time clock provided as part of the system. System must have variable user rights as assigned by the System Administrator (SA). 3. System must have variable user rights as assigned by the System Administrator (SA). 4. Only personnel with download access rights will be allowed to enter case picture files into the system. 5. Photo securing is required. Once photos are imported (acquired) into the system they need to be "Secured" by some form of multiple HASH values to represent the state of the photo at the time it is imported. This guards against modification of the photo from this point forward because the system can recalculate the HASH values at a later time and compare it to the calculated HASH values at the import time to see if the photo remains unchanged. The HASH algorithm used in item 5 must have multiple interlocking HASH values. This means calculating multiple HASH values for the same digital file using different HASH methods such that all HASH values must be satisfied simultaneously in order for the file to be declared "Secured". This is to prevent problems with the well know property of HASH algorithms know as collisions where it's possible to have different digital files come up with the same value when only a single HASH is used. We require the use of multiple HASH values to prevent this problem and to secure the file properly. Any system using a method described in US Patent 7,480,796 will meet this requirement. System must allow for additional licensing/workstations as needed. System must be fully networkable. System must have the option of a web browser based viewer for possible future expansion of the system. System must assign a serial number to each photo that is unique in the system. No two photos in the system may have the same serial number. Photos may be referenced or searched for by the serial number. System must allow photographer to sign digital photos with a digital signature if this option is selected. System must allow single or groups of photos to be encrypted for safe transportation of the photos outside of the system. The system must have a true client / server software with a smart client software (also known as a thick client) on each client computer to assist in the computing load and add additional security and performance. Photos, video and audio stored in the database must be encrypted. Encryption is necessary because a database administrator who may not be authorized access to the data could see and extract data in a Microsoft SQL Server database. In order to maintain security over sensitive data so that IT personnel that aren't supposed to Section C, Statement of Work dated 8/23/2011 Page 2 of 9

REQUIREMENT be able to view this data won't be able to we require that data stored in the database must be encrypted with a non-publicly known encryption algorithm. Publicly known algorithms such as DES, Blowfish, SHA, RC2, RC4 and other publicly known methods are not permitted. A secure non-public domain encryption method must be used, preferably a FIPS 140-2 approved module. 1. Ability to download photos, audio files and video files governed by user access rights. Personnel will be able to download photos, audio files and video files if they are permitted by their access rights. Ability to add a title and free format notes to multiple photos at a time or to later edit the notes or title for any individual photo individually. All words in the title and notes must be indexed by the database and can be used as a search term to find that photo or group of photos. Searching functions ­ Ability to search downloaded picture files by using tagged metadata fields. Ability to allow the user to select which photo files to import from a thumbnail preview of photos on the memory card before the import has been performed. The system must handle various types of media files including but not limited to, .jpg, .tif, bmp, video files that Microsoft Windows can handle and audio files that Microsoft Windows can handle. System must have the available option of storing any digital file type to allow for future expansion of the system. The system must be able to view Camera RAW format files in both full screen and thumbnail views from within the system without having to export the files out of the system to use an external viewer. The system must be able to do this with RAW files without converting the RAW files into another format. A Wizard Mode for importing photos needs to be provided. Such a mode needs to walk the user through the import process one step at a time to reduce the chance of user errors during the import process. A lossless photo enhancement process must be included. The original photo must be perfectly preserved. Tools must be provided so that common enhancement processes such as Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, RGB color channel strength adjustments may be made without affecting the original photo. The system must be able to perform these enhancements from within the system and should not require exporting the photo out of the system or using third party tools. Exporting the photo out of the system or using third party tools for enhancements is a security breach and is unacceptable. The system can potentially take hundreds of thousands of photos per year. Storage capacity is a concern. The system must be able to store only one copy of each photo to reduce the storage requirements. Enhancements to the photo (see lossless photo enhancement process above) must be stored as separate data, that is much smaller than storing a second copy of the photo, and reapplied to the displayed image without affecting the quality of the original photo and without the need to store additional copies of the photo in order to reduce the disk storage requirements. Ability to view by user access rights, the system must allow for concurrent users

REQUIREMENT to view picture files in the system. 2. User rights may be assigned to restrict the ability to print, copy, export, view, import, edit titles and notes of the photos. Users and cases may also be assigned to groups. In order to view a particular photo the users must belong to the correct group as well as have a high enough security right or permission to view the photo. Items should be searchable by meta data tags. A full screen viewing mode should be available where the photos can be viewed full screen. If multiple photos are selected this mode should allow the user to go from photo to photo by pressing the left or right arrow keys. The user should also be able to zoom in on a portion of the photo by clicking over that portion of the photo with the mouse. Full screen viewing performance: While viewing photos in full screen mode the system should be able to display photos at 5 photos per second or faster to allow quick browsing of the photos in a particular set. This saves labor costs and saves this agency money by reducing manpower waste. This speed requirement applies to all photos up to 50 Megapixel in size and for all photo formats, including but not restricted to, Jpeg, RAW, BMP, TIFF. The system should allow photos to be viewed in thumbnail mode where multiple photos may be viewed in thumbnail form in a single window. The thumbnails need to show in 3 sizes (small, medium and large). The thumbnail performance needs to be extremely fast and the thumbnails need to display at the minimum of 50 thumbnails per second or faster. A page with 50 thumbnails should not take longer than 1 second to refresh on a computer with at least 2 GHz CPU. The system should have a portable slide show feature so that photos can be shared with locations that may not have a network connection to the system. The portable slide show feature must be a single file that is self contained and contains both the player and photo data. This slide show viewer, when launched, will have a simple, easy to use VCR type controls to allow the recipient to play automatically, go forward and backwards through the photo slide show. This portable slide show must compress efficiently and be able to store at least 50 photos or more in a typical package of 3 Megabytes or less so that it can be optionally emailed without overflowing a typical email "in box". The portable slide show must have an optional password feature and protect the photos by not allowing full resolution photos to be printed or copied and pasted into another program. System must offer capability to play back any audio or video file compatible with Microsoft Windows. These files must be searchable by title or notes or case number. System should have a messaging function where messages can be sent between users. The messages are intended to show the next time the user logs in. The messaging function should also allowed messages to be scheduled and delayed such that they are delivered the next time the user logs in after a specific date and time.

SECTION M ­ EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
Basis for Award The Government intends to award one (1) purchase order to the responsible Quoter whose quote conforms to the RFQ, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other non-price factors considered, such that it provides the best value to the Government. Best value is defined as the procurement process that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government that is performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis between price and non-price factors. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all Quotes if such action is in the public interest. Under a best value procurement, the NTSB may reasonably determine that the superior capability merits a higher price. The NTSB may also reasonably determine that the Quoter with other than the highest capability in non-price factors is the best value. The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in Quotes. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Quoters are cautioned that they must submit a best quote with the initial quote. Responsibility Determination In order to be eligible for award, the Contracting Officer must determine that the Quoter is responsible according to the standards of FAR 9.1, "Responsible Prospective Contractors". Evaluation Process The following factors will be evaluated by the Government: QUOTE PART # I Technical Quote FACTORS 1 2 3 4 TITLE Corporate Experience Software Capability Past Performance Price

NTSBR110020, Attachment 1 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST Quoters are instructed to respond to each numbered item in the grid below. If the quoter desires to supplement the response with comments, indicate where in the quote (Section and Page Number) the information can be found. The quoter may also qualify a response by explaining how its software accomplishes the item, or how the software may be modified to accomplish the item. Do not respond "Meets" if your system requires a modification to accomplish the item.

Security/User Rights/Licensing 1. Photo Authentication is a mandatory requirement. The system must have the ability to Authenticate digital Jpeg or Camera RAW digital photo files produced by digital cameras. By "Authentication" we specifically mean the examination of the photos at the time it is imported into the system to look for signs that the photos were edited by photo editing software PRIOR to import into the system and PRIOR to acquisition of the photo into the system. If no signs of editing were found the system needs to indicate that the photo passed Authentication. Authentication must be able to determine the known camera model that produced the photo file to be imported and that the photo file does or does not show signs that it has been altered by photo editing software between when the camera took the photo and when the photo is imported into the computer. Authentication must be able to work with multiple brands of cameras to allow our agency a choice of brands including, but not limited to, cameras from Nikon, Canon, Agfa, Pentax, Contax, Epson, Kodak, FujiFilm, HP, Konica Minolta, Kyocera, Leica, Olympus, Ricoh, Samsung, Sanyo, Sigma, Casio, SONY, Toshiba, Panasonic. 2. System must have an audit trail. The audit trail should include tracking all persons (using login and password) who accessed NTSBR110020, Attachment 1 Page 1 of 7

the system/file and the actions performed (print, view, etc.). All audit trail items must be time stamped with a time based on a hardware based tamperproof trusted time clock provided as part of the system. System must have variable user rights as assigned by the System Administrator (SA). System must have variable user rights as assigned by the System Administrator (SA). Only personnel with download access rights will be allowed to enter case picture files into the system. Photo securing is required. Once photos are imported (acquired) into the system they need to be "Secured" by some form of multiple HASH values to represent the state of the photo at the time it is imported. This guards against modification of the photo from this point forward because the system can recalculate the HASH values at a later time and compare it to the calculated HASH values at the import time to see if the photo remains unchanged. The HASH algorithm used in item 5 must have multiple interlocking HASH values. This means calculating multiple HASH values for the same digital file using different HASH methods such that all HASH values must be satisfied simultaneously in order for the file to be declared "Secured". This is to prevent problems with the well know property of HASH algorithms know as collisions where it's possible to have different digital files come up with the same value when only a single HASH is used. We require the use of multiple HASH values to prevent this problem and to secure the file properly. Any system using a method described in US Patent 7,480,796 will meet this requirement. System must allow for additional licensing/workstations as needed. System must be fully networkable. System must have the option of a web browser based viewer for possible future expansion of the system. System must assign a serial number to each photo that is unique in the system. No two photos in the system may have NTSBR110020, Attachment 1 Page 2 of 7

the same serial number. Photos may be referenced or searched for by the serial number. System must allow photographer to sign digital photos with a digital signature if this option is selected. System must allow single or groups of photos to be encrypted for safe transportation of the photos outside of the system. The system must have a true client / server software with a smart client software (also known as a thick client) on each client computer to assist in the computing load and add additional security and performance. Photos, video and audio stored in the database must be encrypted. Encryption is necessary because a database administrator who may not be authorized access to the data could see and extract data in a Microsoft SQL Server database. In order to maintain security over sensitive data so that IT personnel that aren't supposed to be able to view this data won't be able to we require that data stored in the database must be encrypted with a non-publicly known encryption algorithm. Publicly known algorithms such as DES, Blowfish, SHA, RC2, RC4 and other publicly known methods are not permitted. A secure non-public domain encryption method must be used, preferably a FIPS 140-2 approved module.

Downloading 1. Ability to download photos, audio files and video files governed by user access rights. Personnel will be able to download photos, audio files and video files if they are permitted by their access rights. 2. Ability to add a title and free format notes to multiple photos at a time or to later edit the notes or title for any individual photo individually. All words in the title and notes must be indexed by the database and can be used as a search term to find that photo or group of photos. 3.

files by using tagged metadata fields. Ability to allow the user to select which photo files to import from a thumbnail preview of photos on the memory card before the import has been performed. The system must handle various types of media files including but not limited to, .jpg, .tif, bmp, video files that Microsoft Windows can handle and audio files that Microsoft Windows can handle. System must have the available option of storing any digital file type to allow for future expansion of the system. The system must be able to view Camera RAW format files in both full screen and thumbnail views from within the system without having to export the files out of the system to use an external viewer. The system must be able to do this with RAW files without converting the RAW files into another format. A Wizard Mode for importing photos needs to be provided. Such a mode needs to walk the user through the import process one step at a time to reduce the chance of user errors during the import process. A lossless photo enhancement process must be included. The original photo must be perfectly preserved. Tools must be provided so that common enhancement processes such as Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, RGB color channel strength adjustments may be made without affecting the original photo. The system must be able to perform these enhancements from within the system and should not require exporting the photo out of the system or using third party tools. Exporting the photo out of the system or using third party tools for enhancements is a security breach and is unacceptable. The system can potentially take hundreds of thousands of photos per year. Storage capacity is a concern. The system must be able to store only one copy of each photo to reduce the storage requirements. Enhancements to the photo (see lossless photo enhancement process above) must be stored as separate data, that is much smaller than storing a second copy NTSBR110020, Attachment 1 Page 4 of 7

of the photo, and reapplied to the displayed image without affecting the quality of the original photo and without the need to store additional copies of the photo in order to reduce the disk storage requirements. Viewing and Communication 1. Ability to view by user access rights, the system must allow for concurrent users to view picture files in the system. 2. User rights may be assigned to restrict the ability to print, copy, export, view, import, edit titles and notes of the photos. Users and cases may also be assigned to groups. In order to view a particular photo the users must belong to the correct group as well as have a high enough security right or permission to view the photo. Items should be searchable by meta data tags. A full screen viewing mode should be available where the photos can be viewed full screen. If multiple photos are selected this mode should allow the user to go from photo to photo by pressing the left or right arrow keys. The user should also be able to zoom in on a portion of the photo by clicking over that portion of the photo with the mouse. Full screen viewing performance: While viewing photos in full screen mode the system should be able to display photos at 5 photos per second or faster to allow quick browsing of the photos in a particular set. This saves labor costs and saves this agency money by reducing manpower waste. This speed requirement applies to all photos up to 50 Megapixel in size and for all photo formats, including but not restricted to, Jpeg, RAW, BMP, TIFF. The system should allow photos to be viewed in thumbnail mode where multiple photos may be viewed in thumbnail form in a single window. The thumbnails need to show in 3 sizes (small, medium and large). The thumbnail performance needs to be extremely fast and the thumbnails need to display at the minimum of 50 thumbnails per second or faster. A NTSBR110020, Attachment 1 Page 5 of 7

page with 50 thumbnails should not take longer than 1 second to refresh on a computer with at least 2 GHz CPU. The system should have a portable slide show feature so that photos can be shared with locations that may not have a network connection to the system. The portable slide show feature must be a single file that is self contained and contains both the player and photo data. This slide show viewer, when launched, will have a simple, easy to use VCR type controls to allow the recipient to play automatically, go forward and backwards through the photo slide show. This portable slide show must compress efficiently and be able to store at least 50 photos or more in a typical package of 3 Megabytes or less so that it can be optionally emailed without overflowing a typical email "in box". The portable slide show must have an optional password feature and protect the photos by not allowing full resolution photos to be printed or copied and pasted into another program. System must offer capability to play back any audio or video file compatible with Microsoft Windows. These files must be searchable by title or notes or case number. System should have a messaging function where messages can be sent between users. The messages are intended to show the next time the user logs in. The messaging function should also allowed messages to be scheduled and delayed such that they are delivered the next time the user logs in after a specific date and time.

Printing, analysis and advanced technology 1. System must offer an optional calibration module that permits calibrated 1:1 printouts and measurement capability of items in the same focal plane as a ruler or scale. Known sized object selection and calibration must be easy to use and performed with a mouse. 2. The proposed system must provide an audit trail report of the system's use for security purposes.
