INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING NRC FORM 187

NRC Form 187, "Contract Security and/or Classification Requirements," including attachments and supplements, furnishes the basis for providing security and classification requirements to contractors, subcontractors or others (e.g., bidders) who have or may have an NRC contractual relationship which requires access to classified information or matter, for unescorted access to nuclear power plants, access to Unclassified Safeguards Information, access to sensitive IT systems or data and/or access to NRC Headquarters buildings. WHO USES NRC FORM 187: All organizations which have or may have an NRC contractual relationship of the nature set forth above. WHEN TO USE: Responsibility for initiation of NRC Form 187 rests with the office or division sponsoring a contract, project, or consultant, or requesting that such work be conducted (e.g., at a Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory) Early preparation and submission of this form will help assure that all necessary classification and security actions are completed prior to contract award. Experience has shown that incomplete information or untimely submission delays both the security and contractual process. WHERE TO SEND: Send two (2) copies of this form to the NRC Division of Contracts and Property Management (DCPM) with the Request for Procurement Action (NRC Form 400), when the interest does not involve a DOE security interest or consultant obtained through the Office of Human Resources. If the interest involves a DOE National Laboratory or consultant and does not require action by DCPM, forward one (1) copy of the form directly to the Division of Facilities and Security. PREPARATION: Items are keyed to the numbered items on NRC Form 187. 1. 2. 3.
4. 5.A.

Identify contractor, contract number, JOB CODE, or other identifying number(s). Check either 2.A, B, or C as appropriate. If NRC Form 187 is not for a follow-on contract, check block "Does Not Apply." If it is for a follow-on contract, enter preceding contract identification number from which this contract evolves and its actual or anticipated completion date. Include project title and a brief unclassified statement setting forth sufficient information to identify the nature of the project. Check the appropriate box in each column with the highest level of classified matter under National Security Information and Restricted Data, to which access is required. Check "NA" for any items which are not applicable. Completion of this section should be coordinated with the sponsoring Office Authorized Classifier as well as the Project Manager to assure complete and accurate information. Indicate if a contractor must access, store or handle classified information at contractor facility. Indicate if unescorted access is required to protected and vital areas of nuclear power plants. Indicate if access is required to Unclassified Safeguards Information. Indicate if access is required to sensitive IT systems or data. Indicate if unescorted access is required to NRC Headquarters building. Contractors listed in item 1 will submit proposed releases to DCPM for approval prior to release. Subcontractors shall be instructed to submit proposed releases through the prime contractor listed in item 1 to DCPM. If 5.A. is yes, indicate the nature of classification guidance/identification of classification guides. When the block "Nature of Classification Guidance" is used, identify the areas of classified information involved and, in particular, provide adequate unclassified narrative comment to describe specific items of information within these areas which may require classification guidance.

5.B. 5.C. 5.D. 5.E. 5.F. 6. 7.

8. 9. 9.A. 10.

Furnish name and title of position of authorized classifier if Division of Facilities and Security is not checked. The DCPM will assure distribution of this document to all responsible organizations when completed. After approval, the sponsoring office will assure distribution of this document for DOE aggrements. (Not applicable to DOE agreements) The sponsoring office should obtain the signatures required in Boxes 10A and 10B before submitting it to DCPM.

Additional comments relating to any of the items may be included under "Remarks", to assure that reviewers evaluate the information properly.

                                                  Solicitation  NRC-33-11-0011 Addendum EE


NRCAR Subpart 2009.5 Organizational Conflicts of Interest
§2009.500 Scope of subpart.
In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 2210a., NRC acquisitions are processed in accordance with §2009.570, which takes precedence over FAR 9.5 with
respect to organizational conflicts of interest. Where non-conflicting guidance appears in FAR 9.5, that guidance must be followed.
§2009.570 NRC organizational conflicts of interest.
§2009.570-1 Scope of policy.
(a) It is the policy of NRC to avoid, eliminate, or neutralize contractor organizational conflicts of interest. The NRC achieves this objective
by requiring all prospective contractors to submit information describing relationships, if any, with organizations or persons (including those
regulated by the NRC) which may give rise to actual or potential conflicts of interest in the event of contract award.
(b) Contractor conflict of interest determinations cannot be made automatically or routinely. The application of sound judgment on virtually a
case-by-case basis is necessary if the policy is to be applied to satisfy the overall public interest. It is not possible to prescribe in
advance a specific method or set of criteria which would serve to identify and resolve all of the contractor conflict of interest situations
that might arise. However, examples are provided in these regulations to guide application of this policy guidance. The ultimate test is as
follows: Might the contractor, if awarded the contract, be placed in a position where its judgment may be biased, or where it may have an unfair
competitive advantage?
(c) The conflict of interest rule contained in this subpart applies to contractors and offerors only. Individuals or firms who have other
relationships with the NRC (e.g., parties to a licensing proceeding) are not covered by this regulation. This rule does not apply to the
acquisition of consulting services through the personnel appointment process, NRC agreements with other Government agencies, international
organizations, or state, local, or foreign Governments. Separate procedures for avoiding conflicts of interest will be employed in these
agreements, as appropriate.
§2009.570-2 Definitions.
Affiliates means business concerns which are affiliates of each other when either directly or indirectly one concern or individual controls or
has the power to control another, or when a third party controls or has the power to control both.
Contract means any contractual agreement or other arrangement with the NRC except as provided in §2009.570-1(c).
Contractor means any person, firm, unincorporated association, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, affiliates thereof, or their
successors in interest, including their chief executives, directors, key personnel (identified in the contract), proposed consultants or
subcontractors, which are a party to a contract with the NRC.
Evaluation activities means any effort involving the appraisal of a technology, process, product, or policy.
Offeror or prospective contractor means any person, firm, unincorporated association, joint venture, co-sponsor, partnership, corporation, or
their affiliates or successors in interest, including their chief executives, directors, key personnel, proposed consultants, or subcontractors,
submitting a bid or proposal, solicited or unsolicited, to the NRC to obtain a contract.
Organizational conflicts of interest means that a relationship exists whereby a contractor or prospective contractor has present or planned
interests related to the work to be performed under an NRC contract which:
(1) May diminish its capacity to give impartial, technically sound, objective assistance and advice, or may otherwise result in a biased work
product; or
(2) May result in its being given an unfair competitive advantage.
Potential conflict of interest means that a factual situation exists that suggests that an actual conflict of interest may arise from award of a
proposed contract. The term potential conflict of interest is used to signify those situations that
(1) Merit investigation before contract award to ascertain whether award would give rise to an actual conflict; or
(2) Must be reported to the contracting officer for investigation if they arise during contract performance.
Research means any scientific or technical work involving theoretical analysis, exploration, or experimentation.
Subcontractor means any subcontractor of any tier who performs work under a contract with the NRC except subcontracts for supplies and
subcontracts in amounts not exceeding $10,000.
Technical consulting and management support services means internal assistance to a component of the NRC in the formulation or administration of
its programs, projects, or policies which normally require that the contractor be given access to proprietary information or to information that
has not been made available to the public. These services typically include assistance in the preparation of program plans, preliminary designs,
specifications, or statements of work.
§2009.570-3 Criteria for recognizing contractor organizational conflicts of interest.
(a) General.
(1) Two questions will be asked in determining whether actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist:
(i) Are there conflicting roles which might bias an offeror's or contractor's judgment in relation to its work for the NRC?
(ii) May the offeror or contractor be given an unfair competitive advantage based on the performance of the contract?
(2) NRC's ultimate determination that organizational conflicts of interest exist will be made in light of common sense and good business
judgment based upon the relevant facts. While it is difficult to identify and to prescribe in advance a specific method for avoiding all of the
various situations or relationships that might involve potential organizational conflicts of interest, NRC personnel will pay particular
attention to proposed contractual requirements that call for the rendering of advice, consultation or evaluation activities, or similar
activities that directly lay the groundwork for the NRC's decisions on regulatory activities, future procurements, and research programs. Any
work performed at an applicant or licensee site will also be closely scrutinized by the NRC staff.
(b) Situations or relationships. The following situations or relationships may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest:
(1) The offeror or contractor shall disclose information that may give rise to organizational conflicts of interest under the following
circumstances. The information may include the scope of work or specification for the requirement being performed, the period of performance,
and the name and telephone number for a point of contact at the organization knowledgeable about the commercial contract.
(i) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice and recommendations to the NRC in the same technical area where it is also providing
consulting assistance to any organization regulated by the NRC.
(ii) Where the offeror or contractor provides advice to the NRC on the same or similar matter on which it is also providing assistance to any
organization regulated by the NRC.
(iii) Where the offeror or contractor evaluates its own products or services, or has been substantially involved in the development or marketing
of the products or services of another entity.
(iv) Where the award of a contract would result in placing the offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be biased
in relation to its work for the NRC, or would result in an unfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
(v) Where the offeror or contractor solicits or performs work at an applicant or licensee site while performing work in the same technical area
for the NRC at the same site.
(2) The contracting officer may request specific information from an offeror or contractor or may require special contract clauses such as
provided in §2009.570-5(b) in the following circumstances:
(i) Where the offeror or contractor prepares specifications that are to be used in competitive procurements of products or services covered by
the specifications.
(ii) Where the offeror or contractor prepares plans for specific approaches or methodologies that are to be incorporated into competitive
procurements using the approaches or methodologies.
(iii) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to information not available to the public concerning NRC plans, policies, or programs
that could form the basis for a later procurement action.
(iv) Where the offeror or contractor is granted access to proprietary information of its competitors.
(v) Where the award of a contract might result in placing the offeror or contractor in a conflicting role in which its judgment may be biased in
relation to its work for the NRC or might result in an unfair competitive advantage for the offeror or contractor.
(c) Policy application guidance. The following examples are illustrative only and are not intended to identify and resolve all contractor
organizational conflict of interest situations.
(1)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a Request For Proposal (RFP), proposes to undertake certain analyses of a reactor component as
called for in the RFP. The ABC Corp. is one of several companies considered to be technically well qualified. In response to the inquiry in the
RFP, the ABC Corp. advises that it is currently performing similar analyses for the reactor manufacturer.
(ii) Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work normally would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. because the company would be placed in a
position in which its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC. Because there are other well-qualified companies
available, there would be no reason for considering a waiver of the policy.
(2)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to an RFP, proposes to perform certain analyses of a reactor component that is unique to one type of
advanced reactor. As is the case with other technically qualified companies responding to the RFP, the ABC Corp. is performing various projects
for several different utility clients. None of the ABC Corp. projects have any relationship to the work called for in the RFP. Based on the NRC
evaluation, the ABC Corp. is considered to be the best qualified company to perform the work outlined in the RFP.
(ii) Guidance. An NRC contract normally could be awarded to the ABC Corp. because no conflict of interest exists which could motivate bias with
respect to the work. An appropriate clause would be included in the contract to preclude the ABC Corp. from subsequently contracting for work
with the private sector that could create a conflict during the performance of the NRC contract. For example, ABC Corp. would be precluded from
the performance of similar work for the company developing the advanced reactor mentioned in the example.
(3)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a competitive RFP, submits a proposal to assist the NRC in revising NRC's guidance documents on
the respiratory protection requirements of 10 CFR Part 20. ABC Corp. is the only firm determined to be technically acceptable. ABC Corp. has
performed substantial work for regulated utilities in the past and is expected to continue similar efforts in the future. The work has and will
cover the writing, implementation, and administration of compliance respiratory protection programs for nuclear power plants.
(ii) Guidance. This situation would place the firm in a role where its judgment could be biased in relationship to its work for the NRC. Because
the nature of the required work is vitally important in terms of the NRC's responsibilities and no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of
the policy, in accordance with §2009.570-9 may be warranted. Any waiver must be fully documented in accordance with the waiver provisions of
this policy with particular attention to the establishment of protective mechanisms to guard against bias.
(4)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. submits a proposal for a new system to evaluate a specific reactor component's performance for the purpose of
developing standards that are important to the NRC program. The ABC Corp. has advised the NRC that it intends to sell the new system to industry
once its practicability has been demonstrated. Other companies in this business are using older systems for evaluation of the specific reactor
component.
(ii) Guidance. A contract could be awarded to the ABC Corp. if the contract stipulates that no information produced under the contract will be
used in the contractor's private activities unless this information has been reported to the NRC. Data on how the reactor component performs,
which is reported to the NRC by contractors, will normally be disseminated by the NRC to others to preclude an unfair competitive advantage.
When the NRC furnishes information about the reactor component to the contractor for the performance of contracted work, the information may not
be used in the contractor's private activities unless the information is generally available to others. Further, the contract will stipulate
that the contractor will inform the NRC contracting officer of all situations in which the information, developed about the performance of the
reactor component under the contract, is proposed to be used.
(5)(i) Example. The ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, proposes to assemble a map showing certain seismological features of the Appalachian fold
belt. In accordance with the representation in the RFP and §2009.570-3(b)(1)(i), ABC Corp. informs the NRC that it is presently doing
seismological studies for several utilities in the eastern United States, but none of the sites are within the geographic area contemplated by
the NRC study.
(ii) Guidance. The contracting officer would normally conclude that award of a contract would not place ABC Corp. in a conflicting role where
its judgment might be biased. Section 2052.209-72(c) Work for Others, would preclude ABC Corp. from accepting work which could create a conflict
of interest during the term of the NRC contract.
(6)(i) Example. AD Division of ABC Corp., in response to a RFP, submits a proposal to assist the NRC in the safety and environmental review of
applications for licenses for the construction, operation, and decommissioning of fuel cycle facilities. ABC Corp. is divided into two separate
and distinct divisions, AD and BC. The BC Division performs the same or similar services for industry. The BC Division is currently providing
the same or similar services required under the NRC's contract for an applicant or licensee.
(ii) Guidance. An NRC contract for that particular work would not be awarded to the ABC Corp. The AD Division could be placed in a position to
pass judgment on work performed by the BC Division, which could bias its work for NRC. Further, the Conflict of Interest provisions apply to ABC
Corp. and not to separate or distinct divisions within the company. If no reasonable alternative exists, a waiver of the policy could be sought
in accordance with §2009.570-9.
(7)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. completes an analysis for NRC of steam generator tube leaks at one of a utility's six sites. Three months later,
ABC Corp. is asked by this utility to perform the same analysis at another of its sites.
(ii) Guidance. Section 2052.290-72(c)(3) would prohibit the contractor from beginning this work for the utility until one year after completion
of the NRC work at the first site.
(8)(i) Example. ABC Corp. is assisting NRC in a major on-site analysis of a utility's redesign of the common areas between its twin reactors.
The contract is for two years with an estimated value of $5 million. Near the completion of the NRC work, ABC Corp. requests authority to
solicit for a $100K contract with the same utility to transport spent fuel to a disposal site. ABC Corp. is performing no other work for the
utility.
(ii) Guidance. The Contracting Officer would allow the contractor to proceed with the solicitation because it is not in the same technical area
as the NRC work; and the potential for technical bias by the contractor because of financial ties to the utility is slight due to the relative
value of the two contracts.
(9)(i) Example. The ABC Corp. is constructing a turbine building and installing new turbines at a reactor site. The contract with the utility is
for five years and has a total value of $100 million. ABC Corp. has responded to an NRC Request For Proposal requiring the contractor to
participate in a major team inspection unrelated to the turbine work at the same site. The estimated value of the contract is $75K.
(ii) Guidance. An NRC contract would not normally be awarded to ABC Corp. because these factors create the potential for financial loyalty to
the utility that may bias the technical judgment of the contractor.
(d) Other considerations.
(1) The fact that the NRC can identify and later avoid, eliminate, or neutralize any potential organizational conflicts arising from the
performance of a contract is not relevant to a determination of the existence of conflicts prior to the award of a contract.
(2) It is not relevant that the contractor has the professional reputation of being able to resist temptations which arise from organizational
conflicts of interest, or that a follow-on procurement is not involved, or that a contract is awarded on a competitive or a sole source basis.
§2009.570-4 Representation.
(a) The following procedures are designed to assist the NRC contracting officer in determining whether situations or relationships exist which
may constitute organizational conflicts of interest with respect to a particular offeror or contractor. The procedures apply to small purchases
meeting the criteria stated in the following paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) The organizational conflicts of interest representation provision at §2052.209-71 must be included in solicitations and contracts resulting
from unsolicited proposals. The contracting officer must also include this provision for task orders and contract modifications for new work
for:
(1) Evaluation services or activities;
(2) Technical consulting and management support services;
(3) Research; and
(4) Other contractual situations where special organizational conflicts of interest provisions are noted in the solicitation and would be
included in the resulting contract. This representation requirement also applies to all modifications for additional effort under the contract
except those issued under the "Changes" clause. Where, however, a statement of the type required by the organizational conflicts of interest
representation provisions has previously been submitted with regard to the contract being modified, only an updating of the statement is
required.
(c) The offeror may, because of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, propose to exclude specific kinds of work contained in
a RFP unless the RFP specifically prohibits the exclusion. Any such proposed exclusion by an offeror will be considered by the NRC in the
evaluation of proposals. If the NRC considers the proposed excluded work to be an essential or integral part of the required work and its
exclusion would be to the detriment of the competitive posture of the other offerors, the NRC shall reject the proposal as unacceptable.
(d) The offeror's failure to execute the representation required by paragraph (b) of this section with respect to an invitation for bids is
considered to be a minor informality. The offeror will be permitted to correct the omission.
§2009.570-5 Contract clauses.
(a) General contract clause. All contracts and simplified acquisitions of the types set forth in §2009.570-4(b) must include the clause
entitled, "Contractor Organizational Conflicts of Interest," set forth in §2052.209-72.
(b) Other special contract clauses. If it is determined from the nature of the proposed contract that an organizational conflict of interest
exists, the contracting officer may determine that the conflict can be avoided, or, after obtaining a waiver in accordance with §2009.570-9,
neutralized through the use of an appropriate special contract clause. If appropriate, the offeror may negotiate the terms and conditions of
these clauses, including the extent and time period of any restriction. These clauses include but are not limited to:
(1) Hardware exclusion clauses which prohibit the acceptance of production contracts following a related non-production contract previously
performed by the contractor;
(2) Software exclusion clauses;
(3) Clauses which require the contractor (and certain of its key personnel) to avoid certain organizational conflicts of interest; and
(4) Clauses which provide for protection of confidential data and guard against its unauthorized use.
§2009.570-6 Evaluation, findings, and contract award.
The contracting officer shall evaluate all relevant facts submitted by an offeror and other relevant information. After evaluating this
information against the criteria of §2009.570-3, the contracting officer shall make a finding of whether organizational conflicts of interest
exist with respect to a particular offeror. If it has been determined that real or potential conflicts of interest exist, the contracting
officer shall:
(a) Disqualify the offeror from award;
(b) Avoid or eliminate such conflicts by appropriate measures; or
(c) Award the contract under the waiver provision of §2009.570-9.
§2009.570-7 Conflicts identified after award.
If potential organizational conflicts of interest are identified after award with respect to a particular contractor and the contracting officer
determines that conflicts do exist and that it would not be in the best interest of the Government to terminate the contract, as provided in the
clauses required by §2009.570-5, the contracting officer shall take every reasonable action to avoid, eliminate, or, after obtaining a waiver in
accordance with §2009.570-9, neutralize the effects of the identified conflict.
§2009.570-8 Subcontracts.
The contracting officer shall require offerors and contractors to submit a representation statement from all subcontractors (other than a supply
subcontractor) and consultants performing services in excess of $10,000 in accordance with §2009.570-4(b). The contracting officer shall require
the contractor to include contract clauses in accordance with §2009.570-5 in consultant agreements or subcontracts involving performance of work
under a prime contract.
§2009.570-9 Waiver.
(a) The contracting officer determines the need to seek a waiver for specific contract awards with the advice and concurrence of the program
office director and legal counsel. Upon the recommendation of the Senior Procurement Executive, and after consultation with legal counsel, the
Executive Director for Operations may waive the policy in specific cases if he determines that it is in the best interest of the United States
to do so.
(b) Waiver action is strictly limited to those situations in which:
(1) The work to be performed under contract is vital to the NRC program;
(2) The work cannot be satisfactorily performed except by a contractor whose interests give rise to a question of conflict of interest.
(3) Contractual and/or technical review and surveillance methods can be employed by the NRC to neutralize the conflict.
(c) The justification and approval documents for any waivers must be placed in the NRC Public Document Room.
§2009.570-10 Remedies.
In addition to other remedies permitted by law or contract for a breach of the restrictions in this subpart or for any intentional
misrepresentation or intentional nondisclosure of any relevant interest required to be provided for this section, the NRC may debar the
contractor from subsequent NRC contracts.

                                                ADDENDUM D TO SOLICITATION NO. NRC-HQ-11-R-33-0011
                                                                 AWARD TERM PLAN

1.0   INTRODUCTION

      This Award Term Plan (“Plan”) identifies responsibilities and methods used to monitor and evaluate MOM Contractor performance for the
purpose of awarding additional periods of performance (award term extensions).  The NRC requires top-level performance to meet program
requirements.  This Plan is designed to provide incentive to the Contractor for outstanding performance which benefits the NRC.  The NRC
recognizes that establishing an effective relationship between the contractor and Government is an essential prerequisite of outstanding
performance.  To facilitate an effective relationship, the Government and Contractor will cooperate in developing the essential elements of this
Plan.

The Offeror shall propose a Performance Measurement Metric (PMM) Plan to be submitted with individual task orders.  The Offeror shall propose a
satisfactory level with each metric in the PMM.  The Government and the successful Offeror will negotiate the elements and performance levels
contained in the offeror’s PMM, and the PMM will be incorporated into the resulting Task Order.  In addition to the elements contained in the
PMM, the Government and the Contractor will negotiate achieving Small Business Subcontracting Plan goals, cost control, responsiveness and
business relationship, the performance of which shall be used as part of this Plan.

      The intent of this Plan is to establish procedures for the evaluation of Contractor performance under the IDIQ contract by furnishing
guidelines and procedures for: (1) evaluating the Contractor's performance during each IDIQ contract year; and (2) furnishing sufficient data to
enable the Award Term Approving Official to determine whether an award term will be granted.

2.0   GENERAL

      Through this Plan, NRC seeks to provide incentives for the Contractor to perform at a level NRC considers better than satisfactory.  An
Award Term may only be exercised in accordance with clause B.4 in the solicitation.
3.0   PERFORMANCE AWARD TERM REVIEW TEAM

      3.1   Organization

      The organization of the Team is described in the following paragraphs.

            3.1.1   Award Term Approving Official.  The Award Term Approving Official is a Deputy Director of the NRC Office of Information
Services (OIS).  The Deputy Director may appoint another individual to perform this function for their organization.

            3.1.2  Performance Award Term Review Team.  The Award Term Approving Official will appoint an Award Term Review Team (“Team”) to
evaluate the Contractor's IDIQ contract performance during the then-current IDIQ contract year.  The Award Term Approving Official may appoint a
Chairman to the Team or the Award Term Approving Official may serve as the Chairman.  The team members will ensure a fair and accurate
assessment of the contractor's performance for the period being evaluated.  The Team Chairman may also use non-voting advisors as necessary.

      3.2   Duties of the Team.

      The duties of the Team are as follows:

            3.2.1  Implement the plan and propose timely modifications to the Plan if required, throughout the period of contract performance.

            3.2.2  Evaluate contractor performance for each performance evaluation.

            3.2.3  Prepare and submit to the Award Term Approving Official a written evaluation of the Contractor's performance for a given
evaluation period.

      3.3   Responsibilities.

            3.3.1      Award Term Approving Official.  Approves the Plan and the evaluation factors and scoring methodology.  Approves the
composition of the Team.  Determines the Contractor performance rating for a given IDIQ contract year and whether an Award Term period will be
granted based on the factors of the plan.

            3.3.2      Team Chairman.  Structures the Team membership to provide representation that reflects all appropriate aspects of
contract performance and provides membership to adequately assess contractor performance for the period being evaluated.  Conducts the
evaluation under this Plan.  Schedules Team meetings and serves as a recorder at these meetings.  Leads the Team in developing a consensus
evaluation and in resolving significant differences in ratings.  Provides brief summary documentation for the Award Term Approving Official.
May provide feedback to the Contractor, through the Contracting Officer, in order to focus the Contractor on areas that would lead to improved
performance in subsequent periods.

            3.3.3      Performance Award Term Review Team.  Monitors and evaluates Contractor performance for the period under consideration,
utilizing the factors set forth in the Plan.  Makes written evaluations, completes the evaluation worksheets and formulates award term
recommendations.  Briefs the Award Term Approving Official on evaluations, when requested, and provides supporting data/documentation to support
the assessment of performance.  Prepares the evaluation report and accompanying narrative justification.  Identifies potential improvement areas
and areas of emphasis for the next succeeding evaluation period to the Team Chairman for later Contractor debriefing.

            3.3.4  Contracting Officer.   Prepares and distributes contract modifications awarding the Award Term authorized by the Award Term
Approving Official.  Maintains NRC documentation relating to this Plan as part of the official contract file.    Documents the basis for the
Award Term decision rendered by the Award Term Approving Official in the contract file.  Informs the Contractor in writing of annual Award Term
evaluation results and Award Term decision.

4.0   PROCEDURES FOR AWARD TERM EVALUATION PERIODS

      4.1   Procedures for Award Term Evaluation Periods

Step 1.     The Contractor may submit a brief written self-evaluation of its performance within 10 days after the end of the evaluation period.
The self-evaluation report shall not exceed 7 pages, and will be considered in the Award Term Review Board’s (ATRB’s) (or Term Determining
Official’s) evaluation of the Contractor’s performance during this period.

Step 2.          Team members shall individually initiate their evaluation worksheets (Award Term Evaluation Form) within 3 days after the end
of each evaluation period.  Informational sessions will be conducted at the end of year-one of the base year. The first official Award Term
evaluation for eligibility will be conducted at the end of year-two of the base year and again at the end of the Option Period.   Evaluations
will be completed within 10 days after the end of each evaluation period and completed worksheets will be submitted to the Team Chairman (if one
is appointed) or Award Term Approving Official.  Team members shall be prepared to brief their evaluations to the Chairman if necessary.

Step 3.          The Team will develop a consensus evaluation of Contractor performance in the appropriate areas for the then-current IDIQ
contract period, using the factors set forth in the plan.  The Team shall review all evaluation material along with supporting documentation and
may call additional technical and management advisors to provide supporting information as required.

Recommendations of the Team, together with Contractor self evaluation and other supporting justifications, shall be presented to the Award Term
Approving Official for final decision no later than 20 days from the end of each evaluation period.   Evaluation activities need to be completed
at a point no later than 30 days after the end of each evaluation period to ensure that the Award Term Approving Official’s decision is
announced no later than 90 days after the period being evaluated.

Step 4.     No later than 30 days after the Award Term Approving Official receives the Team’s recommendations, the Award Term Approving Official
shall make a determination of the Contractor's evaluation rating for the applicable evaluation period.  A brief summary narrative report
highlighting Contractor strengths and weaknesses shall be prepared.  The written announcement to the Contracting Officer of Award Term Approving
Official’s decision will be made no later than 60 days after the end of each evaluation period.

Step 5.     Within 30 days after receiving the Award Term Approving Official decision, the Contracting Officer shall forward to the Contractor
the evaluation results.  The Contracting Officer shall forward the notice to the contractor not later 90 days after the end of the applicable
evaluation period and the modification adding the award term entitlement will follow as soon as practicable following the notification.

Step 6.     Prior to Contractor commencement of work under an Award Term period, the Contracting Officer will issue a modification to the IDIQ
contract to authorize the Award Term then negotiate and award task order(s), if any are required and funding is available.

5.0  OPPORTUNITY TO ADJUST PERFORMANCE METRICS

5.1. Adjusting Performance Rating

Bilateral changes may be made to the award term plan at any time.  It is possible that actual performance will reveal that the negotiated levels
are either too easy or too difficult to attain.  The Contractor and Contracting Officer will negotiate the satisfactory and higher levels of
performance ratings.  The values may be renegotiated at the request of either party.  If an agreement cannot be made within 60 days, the
Government reserves the right to set the values unilaterally in the event an agreement is not reached.

5.2. Modification of Performance Measurement Metrics

The Contractor’s PMM is a living document. The parties recognize that performance elements may be added or deleted during the life of the
contract. New or revised performance elements will be considered to be incorporated into this Plan when the elements are incorporated into the
Contractor’s PMM.

use NRC software development methodology

use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to describe solution requirements (use cases) and designs



COTS solutions must:



not be customized in a manner that will inhibit or prevent upgrades to future vendor product versions

be compatible with standard NRC platforms and technologies

leverage common NRC services/solutions for controlling security where feasible, such as identity and access management, and audit logging



NRC Technical Reference Model (TRM):



NRC is maintaining a TRM that documents the technologies and commercial products as service standards for modernization of the agency’s legacy information technology (IT) systems.  Versions supported will normally include the latest vendor major version and the prior vendor major version.  Vendors providing technology services must have the capabilities to implement and maintain technology solutions that are in alignment with the TRM and the agency’s IT modernization vision and strategy.  The TRM is expected to change over time as new technology capabilities are implemented to address agency needs.  Vendors providing technology services are expected to use the latest TRM version in evaluating and selecting technologies for their solutions.  The agency’s TRM and IT modernization strategy includes the following preferred and strategic technologies (use of technologies outside of this list must be pre-approved):



System Runtime Technologies





Technology Standards and Open Source



.Net Framework and Windows Communication Framework, Java and Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE),   and  (AJAX), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Representational State Transfer (REST) Framework, RSS, ATOM, W3C XML Specifications, XML-based Languages such as SOAP and HTML, Oasis Web Services Specifications, Semantic Web and Resource Description Framework.



Software Solution Implementation Support Tools



Adobe Flex, Adobe AIR, Adobe Flash Builder, Adobe Dreamweaver, Code profiling tools (e.g. JProbe for Eclipse and Visual Studio Profiler), Eclipse Based IDE, IBM WebSphere Studio, IBM Rational Software Quality Management Suite, IBM Rational Team Concert, IBM Rational Rose, IBM Rational Requirements Composer, IBM Rational Quality Manager, and other Rational Tools based on the Jazz Platform, Java Software Development Kit (SDK), Java Script, Microsoft Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Jetico BCWipe, K2 Designer for Visual Studio, Microsoft .Net ASP, Microsoft .Net C#, Microsoft Project Server and Project Web Access, Microsoft SDelete,  Microsoft SharePoint Designer, Microsoft Visio and plug-ins for K2, Python Runtime Environment, Report builder/creation tools (e.g. SQL Report Builder and Business Objects/Crystal Report Designer), SQL, Toad



Standard Microsoft Office Suite



Used for productivity purposes and should not be used to develop applications to manage systems of record information (e.g. financial) or as a data store for PII information.  Applications of this nature require appropriate controls to be implemented for security, reliability, and performance.



Other Technologies and Tools by Special Requests



These tools are used for formal software development activities and as such, must be installed and used in a suitable development environment.  Suitable development environment can be any development workstation that is not connected directly to the POE (e.g. a virtual development desktop image, a standalone workstation, or separate/isolated network).    



Java open source or Javascript libraries (e.g. JQuery, etc.)

Any programming SDK or API such as JSpell

Eclipse plugins

Other Integrated Development Environments (IDE’s) or code editor (e.g. jEdit)

Other desktop script-based runtime environments

Other language compilers such as C, C++, and Fortran

 SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK




1 Overview


   1. Background

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was created as an independent Agency by Congress in 1974 to enable the nation to safely use
radioactive materials for beneficial civilian purposes while ensuring that people and the environment are protected. It regulates commercial
nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials, such as in nuclear medicine, through licensing, inspection, and enforcement of its
requirements. The NRC’s headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and there are a number of other offices around the United States.

C.
        1.
        2. Objectives

The objective of this acquisition for “Maintenance, Operation, and Modernization Support of U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Application
Systems and Environment” (also referred to as “MOM”) is to procure continuous maintenance and operational Information Technology (IT) support
services for current and future NRC automated computer systems.  This acquisition will also provide modernization support services while
replacing legacy technologies with secure, innovative, enterprise-wide IT solutions.  This acquisition focuses on both enterprise and service
level requirements for IT services.  The modernization support services and replacement of legacy technologies will help reduce maintenance and
operation (M&O) costs while achieving the goals stated in Section C.

C.
        1.
        2.
        3. Specific Service Objectives

The NRC currently has approximately 100 computer-based application systems that require MOM support services.  These systems are generally
managed by separate NRC organizations responsible for related functional use and system operation.  In addition, the NRC anticipates adding
approximately three new application systems each year over the duration of this contract.

The NRC has the following goals for this acquisition:

   a) Establish secure, enterprise-wide, and standardized IT solutions

   b) Maximize flexibility, agility, and innovation in IT service delivery

   c) Deliver reliable, high quality, and cost effective IT solutions

   d) Create effective IT governance where appropriate

   e) Enable the NRC to more effectively meet its mission


C.2  Maintenance, Operations and Modernization

C.2.1  Maintenance

NRC’s application system maintenance is defined as modification and/or correction of application system code and/or data to make the application
system perform as intended in support of the business process for which the code was written. These modifications may include those made to
programs, scripts, job control languages, and data.  Maintenance also includes, but is not limited to, analysis of conditions and outputs to
identify root causes of problems and define methods for correction by troubleshooting, executing backups, restoring archives, and housekeeping.

Maintenance may take the form of preventive, corrective, adaptive, or perfective actions or any combination of these actions.

   a) Preventive Maintenance – identify potential future faults and modify the system to mitigate the risk


   b) Corrective Maintenance – identify current system faults and modify the system to fix them


   c) Adaptive Maintenance – modify the system to maintain compliance with changing IT infrastructure, IT security requirements, and technology
      upgrades


   d) Perfective Maintenance – modify the system to add new or improved functionality

C.
            1.
            2.
                       1.
2. Operations

The primary goal for the operation function is to manage and support NRC’s software in a production environment. The focus of operations is to
ensure that software is running properly and that the appropriate data is backed up and restored as needed. Disaster recovery plans are created
and, in the event a disaster occurs, are executed to restore primary systems. The focus of operational support is to assist end users by
answering their questions, analyzing the problems they are encountering with production systems, recording requests for new functionality, and
making/applying fixes.

The contractor shall keep systems running, back-up and restore data based on the operations plan and system requirements, manage problems,
performing periodic cleanup, fine tune system reconfigurations, monitor systems, and redeploy systems as necessary.

Contractor operational support may take various forms including, but not limited to, the following:

   a) Data Support – perform data entry, interpretation, scanning, and verification

   b) Report Generation – produce standard and ad hoc reports

   c) Production Support – perform data transfers, system monitoring, and troubleshooting

   d) Test Support – perform application testing in accordance with testing procedures contained in the Project Management Methodology (PMM) and
      Test Management Guide

   e) Plan for Disaster  Recovery – define and update steps for staff to follow to achieve critical system back up and operation in the event of
      catastrophe

   f) Disaster Recovery– maintain, store, and execute the Disaster Recovery Plan to ensure timely recovery of critical systems

C.
             1.
             2.
        1.
        2.
   3. Modernization

Agency system modernization support is a proactive approach to managing the ongoing evolution of business processes and systems, while focusing
on achieving an optimized IT environment for value, cost, and risk.

Many outdated legacy systems will be on unsupported software during the period of performance of this contract and therefore modernization
activities must be executed.  The NRC will review the current IT environment to identify outdated or unsupported application systems for
modernization.

To facilitate optimum business processes and systems, modernization may take the form of application improvement, language-to-language
conversion, platform migration, consolidation, or any combination of the following activities:

   a) Application Improvement – improve the robustness, integrity, quality, consistency, and/or performance of a system

   b) Language-to-Language Conversion – convert an application from one computer language to another computer language

   c) Platform Migration – move a system from one computer platform to another computer platform

   d) Consolidation – combine two or more systems into one

The NRC continues to mature its Enterprise Architecture (EA) to help achieve its mission goals of nuclear safety, nuclear security, and
operational excellence. To effectively manage the complexities of architecting the enterprise, the NRC uses the Office of Management and
Budget’s (OMB) segment architecture approach to analyze similar business functions within the agency, based on a framework and vocabulary common
across the Federal Government.

The NRC has defined 14 segments that are divided into core mission areas that align to the major business functions of the organization, as well
as the business and enterprise service areas necessary to maintain operational excellence.  NRC system architecture can be seen in Figure 1
below.

Figure 1: NRC Segment Architecture

This NRC segment architecture will be utilized during performance of MOM task orders to group application systems into the appropriate segment.
To insure greater consistency among NRC application systems, the NRC segment architecture will allow MOM contractors to focus on a group of
related NRC application systems while providing M&O support to legacy systems, developing requirements and design, modernizing legacy systems,
and providing M&O support for the modernized systems.

             4. Functional Area Requirements

The solicitation requirements have been broken down into five functional areas (FAs) in order to ensure superior maintenance, operations, and
modernization support for NRC application systems. The NRC anticipates awarding separate Indefinite- Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ)
contracts under each of the following five functional areas.

   a) FA1: Centralized Environment Support  (full and open competition resulting in one award)


   e) FA2: M&O of Legacy Systems (full and open competition with potential for multiple awards)


   f) FA3: Requirements and Design (full and open competition with potential for multiple awards);


   g) FA4: Legacy Modernization and New Software Application Development (small business set-aside with potential for multiple awards)


   h) FA5: M&O of Modernized Systems  (small business set-aside with potential for multiple awards)

These functional areas all play an important role in the success of this acquisition.  Contractors under this acquisition shall ensure open
communication between all functional areas in order to seamlessly provide maintenance, operations, and modernization support.  Figure 2, below,
shows the flow of information between contractors in each of the five functional areas.  The NRC will interact directly with contractors in each
of the five functional areas.  Contractors for FA2, FA3, FA4 and FA5 shall all work within the development and testing environments provided by
the FA1 contractor.

Figure 2: MOM Interactions between Functional Areas

The following sections describe each of the five functional areas in more detail.  More detailed requirements for each functional area will be
specified in the performance work statement for each individual task order.

   1. FA1: Centralized Environment Support

This functional area requires the contractor to provide the development and test environments to be utilized by each contractor that receives an
award under this acquisition.  The development and test environments shall simulate the NRC’s IT environment.  The FA1 contractor shall provide
high-speed (something other than dial-up) internet access and a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to other awardees under this
acquisition for development and test efforts.  Contractors in the other four functional areas are responsible for implementing and funding their
own high-speed access and VPN connection in order to access the NRC Centralized Environment.

This FA may also include requirements for non-standard technologies (outside of what is in Appendix F) for engineering technical services that
need to be introduced for modernization.

Figure 3 provides a high level illustration of how the FA1 contractor will interact with the NRC, as well as with contractors in other
functional areas (FA2, FA3, FA4 and FA5).

[pic]
Figure 3: MOM Centralized Environment Overview


                              1. Government Furnished Equipment

For physically based hosting solutions, the NRC will provide all equipment and server software (except for access specific software) required
for the centralized environment infrastructure.  If a cloud based solution is proposed, then the Government will only provide server software if
appropriate.  Additional Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) may be provided for individual task order requirements.

                              2. System Administration Support

   a) The contractor shall provide on-site application systems administration system support.

   b) The contractor shall provide hardware administration, configuration, and software installation and deployment support including application
      support.  Support developers and testers in the activities associated with design, code, test, debug and documentation of applications and
      administration.  Provide access controls in accordance with Agency procedures and maintain and review audit logs.   Work at the highest
      technical level of all phases of system administration, system engineering, access control, and security control.  Ensure operational
      availability of the centralized environment in accordance with the performance metrics defined in Appendix D.





                              3. Place of Performance

The anticipated place of performance shall be at the contractor site and/or Government sites in Rockville, MD. The FA1 contractor site and their
deployed resources must be within a ten mile radius of the NRC Headquarters Building (11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852) and be within
Montgomery County, Maryland.

                              4. Centralized Environment Support

In the accomplishment of its mission, NRC utilizes a wide diversity of general purpose digital computers ranging from servers to desktop
workstations.  These systems, while diverse in capability, are functionally interoperable through their support of IP networking and
interoperability standards.  These systems provide source code and application interoperability and portability through their support of the
applications development and testing with other IT standards and alternate operating systems, such as Windows and Linux.  They allow users to
move between machines in a heterogeneous networked environment while maintaining an interoperable user environment.  The FA1 contractor shall
host IBM Rational tools (Rational Enterprise Suite and Rational Jazz Platform) to be used by FA2, FA3, FA4, and FA5 contractors to perform
development and testing activities.

   a) Software Support

Software support service shall only be applicable to software provided as GFE under this contract.  Software support shall consist of correction
or updates revisions through software patches, software upgrades, and technical support for problem resolution of operating systems and the
development tools in the JAVA or .Net platform suites or any software located in the centralized environment.   The FA1 contractor shall only
make changes to the development and test environments after an approved change request has been issued from the NRC Project Officer (PO) for the
FA1 contract.

   b) Software Patches

Software patches are modifications to the software that provide fixes to address security issues and known problems. The contractor shall
provide software patches to all end users through on-line access.

   c) Technical Support

The contractor shall provide technical support to NRC end users and, as applicable, other contractors supporting NRC. This technical support
shall be provided, at a minimum, from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Eastern Time), Monday through Friday (excluding Government holidays and other days
when NRC is closed).  Technical support may include, but is not limited to, the following:

        i. Access support to environment


       ii. Telephone support or support located within the centralized environment


      iii. Developer and tester support


       iv. Deployment support


        v. Configuration and change management support


       vi. Troubleshooting


      vii. Backups


   a)
   b)
   c)
   d) Software/System Deployment Support

Applications and systems that are new, undergoing maintenance, enhancement or modernization, must follow a formal configuration/change
management (CM) process to ensure proper controls over scope, performance, quality, and security management of the application system.
Separation of duties between the application/system personnel and CM personnel is necessary to ensure consistency of controls and the quality of
baselines that are migrated between environments.

Therefore, the contractor shall support NRC PO and their designees in promoting approved system baselines between environments.  The contractor
shall provide technical support for the change impact and risk evaluations as part of the NRC CM process.  Ensure development and test
environments are kept in synch with the current CM baseline definitions.  The contractor shall use IBM Rational tools and formal CM processes
(described in Section C.5.2) to manage stable baselines and change requests.  The contractor shall follow this same CM process to manage the
environment infrastructure changes.

                              5. Development Environment

Objective – New IT applications and systems are regularly brought into the NRC production environment. These are either custom developed or
commercial items. Many of these systems are developed by third-party contractors who know very little about the NRC production environments.
Currently, development environments are set up completely externally to the NRC, and it is only at the test stage that system integrators
encounter problems related to bringing their systems into the production environment.

Therefore, the contractor shall provide a development environment for developers and/or system integrators to work in, which is separated from
the production environment. This development environment must simulate the actual production environment so that development issues can be
resolved early and real problems can be identified and corrected. Although individual IT system owners must take the responsibility to move
their systems through this process, the contractor may be required to assist them in this endeavor.

Requirement – The contractor shall operate the development environment and maintain the ability to develop new applications and hardware to
ensure a smooth transition to the test environment

In addition, the contractor shall:

   a) Maintain the development environment network including infrastructure, servers, and applications with up to date patching at the same level
      of the NRC production environment.

   b) Ensure that the development environment is segregated from the centralized test and NRC production environments.

   c) Operate and manage the development environment to support application development, network performance impact analysis, network modeling
      and simulation, integration, demonstration, product briefings, evaluation and orientation/training for any software products and custom
      services and applications to be integrated into the centralized environment.

   d) Ensure application and hardware integration into the development environment without adverse impact on the centralized environment.

   e) Ensure non-production data sets for development systems can be imported into the development environment. No production data shall be used
      in the development environment.

   f) Provide recommendations for a solution that allows users to develop applications from anywhere by accessing a virtual desktop within the
      development environment without any risk to the production environment. The NRC reserves the right to decline the recommended solution;
      therefore, the contractor shall provide this capability upon request and approval in writing by the NRC PO. The recommendation will also
      need to be approved by the NRC prior to production implementation.

   g) Manage a schedule of development environment availability, publish that schedule, and work with customers (to include NRC and other
      contractors under this acquisition) in scheduling the use of the environment.

   h) Ensure availability of the development environment in accordance with the performance metrics defined in Appendix D.

   i) Support NRC’s centralized CM personnel in promoting approved system baselines between environments.

   j) Minimize the number of incidents associated with any change to the development environment.

   k) Provide technical support for the change impact and risk evaluations as part of the NRC CM process.

   l) Ensure development environment is kept in synch with the current CM baseline definitions.

   m) Use the IBM Rational tools and formal CM processes to manage stable baselines and change requests.

   n) Follows the standard CM process to manage the environment infrastructure changes.

                              6. Test Environment

Objective – The NRC regularly adds and changes technologies. However, as existing IT services are vital to the day-to-day productivity of NRC
users, it is essential that the introduction of these changes does not disrupt normal Agency operations. Therefore, all modifications must be
thoroughly tested in the NRC’s test environment and appropriate precautions must be taken to mitigate any disruptions that they might introduce.


The contractor shall maintain and operate a Government furnished test environment that simulates the production environment so that tests can be
as accurate as possible and real problems can be identified and corrected. Although individual IT system owners must take the responsibility to
move their systems through this process, the contractor may be required to assist them to succeed in this endeavor by providing expertise in
test environment management and resolving common test environment issues through ensuring that appropriate controls are maintained in the test
environment.

The test environment shall operate on a separate network from the production environment.  However, personnel in the NRC Infrastructure Computer
Operations Division (ICOD) will have the ability to pull code from the NRC centralized test environment for NRC acceptance testing prior to
deployment in the NRC production environment.

Requirement – The contractor shall operate the test environment and maintain the ability to test all new applications and hardware to ensure a
smooth transition to the production environment.

In addition, the contractor shall:

   a) Maintain the test environment network including infrastructure, servers and applications with up-to-date patching at the same level as the
      production environment.

   b) Ensure that the test environment is segregated from the centralized development and NRC production environments.

   c) Operate and manage the test environment to support testing, network performance impact analysis, network modeling and simulation, load
      testing, application testing, testing relating to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (see www.section508.gov),
      integration, demonstration, product briefings, evaluation and orientation/training for all software and custom services and applications to
      be integrated into the centralized environment.

   d) Ensure application and hardware deployed into NRC Consolidated Test Facility (CTF) without adverse impact on the infrastructure.

   e) Ensure non-production data sets for testing systems can be imported into the test environment. No production data shall be used in the test
      environment.

   f) Provide recommendations for a solution that allows users to test applications from anywhere by accessing a virtual desktop within the test
      environment without any risk to the production environment. The NRC reserves the right to decline the recommended solution; therefore, the
      contractor shall provide this capability upon request and in written approval by the NRC PO. The recommendation will also need to be
      approved in writing by the NRC PO prior to production implementation.

   g) Manage a schedule of test environment availability, publish that schedule, and work with customers (to include NRC and other awardees under
      this MOM acquisition) in scheduling the use of the environment.

   h) Ensure availability of the test environment in accordance with the performance metrics defined in Appendix D.

   i) Support NRC’s centralized CM personnel in promoting approved system baselines between environments.

   j) Minimize the number of incidents associated with any change to the test environment.

   k) Minimize the incidents/problems/errors that are discovered found in the live environment, after system release.

   l) Provide technical support for the change impact and risk evaluations as part of the NRC CM process.

   m) Ensure test environment is kept in synch with the current CM baseline definitions.

   n) Use the IBM Rational tools and formal CM processes to manage stable baselines and change requests.

   o) Follows the standard CM process to manage the environment infrastructure changes.

                              7. Communication

The contractor shall ensure open communication and appropriate information transfer with the NRC PO and other contractors during the period of
performance of this acquisition.

   2. FA2: Maintenance and Operations of Legacy Systems

The FA2 contractor(s) shall provide M&O support for the approximately 100 legacy NRC application systems.

Figure 4 provides a high level illustration of how the FA2 contractor(s) will interact with the NRC, as well as, contractors in other functional
areas (FA1, FA3, and FA4).  The FA2 contractor(s) shall coordinate with the FA1 contractor to develop and test legacy system releases, as
directed by NRC change requests.  The FA2 contractor(s) shall also provide open communications with FA3 contractor(s) in order to ensure legacy
systems are accurately documented during retirements and design efforts.  Finally, FA2 contractor(s) shall coordinate with the FA4 contractor(s)
during modernization efforts.  The FA2 contractor(s) shall ensure that legacy system code is stable and unchanged while modernization efforts
are performed.  If maintenance is required (and approved in writing by the NRC PO) on a legacy system during modernization efforts, the NRC, FA2
contractor(s), and the FA4 contractor(s) shall work together to ensure any changes to the legacy system are incorporated into the modernized
system during the transition period from a legacy system to a modernized system.

   e) Work with FA3 contractor(s) and the FA1 contractor for any Rational tools used and ensure those tools, as directed in writing by the NRC
      PO, are integrated into the M&O processes.

   f) The NRC PO or designee shall notify the contractor of maintenance requests using the Rational ClearQuest or Rational Team Concert CR system
      and approve the CRs that will be included in each system release using the procedures specified in MD 2.8.

   g) Updating all application system changes in the system and security documentation, including any changes that affect the security controls
      within the application system, prior to system deployment.

   h) Coordinate, through the NRC PO, with the NRC Computer Security Office (CSO) and ICOD on changes relating to security controls.

   i) Implementing changes to application systems using only the specific products defined in the application system baseline, unless
      authorization has been received in writing from the NRC PO (i.e., if the application is coded in Java 1.5, only Java 1.5 will be used in
      the changes).

   j) Ensuring that the introduction of any new product to the application system is consistent with the authorized list of products (i.e., the
      Technical Reference Model (TRM)) or approved by the NRC Environmental Change Control Board (ECCB) prior to implementation.

   k) Adhere to existing (or as modified by NRC) Maintenance, Operations, and Modernization Change Request Process as defined in Section C.5.2.

   l) Adhere to documentation support requirements.  The NRC Configuration Control Board (CCB) will consist of a Parent CCB board and children
      CCB, which will be subordinate to the Parent CCB.  Parent CCB will review documentation requirements in conjunction with segment
      architecture to determine documentation needs for legacy systems.

   m) Ensure all changes requested, while the legacy system is being modernized are formally approved in writing by the NRC CCB prior to system
      modification.

   n) Ensure open communication and appropriate information transfer with the NRC PO and other contractors during the period of performance of
      this acquisition.

   d) Attend regular NRC project meetings to review project schedules, status and resource allocations

   e) Coordinate closely with the other personnel (NRC employees,  MOM contractors, etc.) on projects to ensure smooth transitions

   f) Implement and coordinate the use of NRC MD 2.8 for all IT infrastructure programs and efforts

   g) Minimize the discrepancy between the milestones defined in Microsoft Projects, and the actual delivery of these project milestones

   4. Quality Assurance

The contractor shall maintain a formal Quality Assurance Program (QAP) that assures the accuracy and completeness of the required deliverables.
The QAP shall include minimal effort requirements and escalating stages as needed to identify and correct deficiencies and errors.

 SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS




H.1  2052.215-70  KEY PERSONNEL (JAN 1993)


   (a)  The following individuals are considered to be essential to the successful performance of the work hereunder:


   Individual task orders may specify key personnel



 The contractor agrees that personnel may not be removed from the contract work or replaced without compliance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of
this section.

   (b)  If one or more of the key personnel, for whatever reason, becomes, or is expected to become, unavailable for work under this contract
for a continuous period exceeding 30 work days, or is expected to devote substantially less effort to the work than indicated in the proposal or

officer, promptly replace the personnel with personnel of at least substantially equal ability and qualifications.

   (c)  Each request for approval of substitutions must be in writing and contain a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the
proposed substitutions.  The request must also contain a complete resume for the proposed substitute and other information requested or needed
by the contracting officer to evaluate the proposed substitution.  The contracting officer and the project officer shall evaluate the
contractor's request and the contracting officer shall promptly notify the contractor of his or her decision in writing.

   (d)  If the contracting officer determines that suitable and timely replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated, or
have otherwise become unavailable for the contract work is not reasonably forthcoming, or that the resultant reduction of productive effort
would be so substantial as to impair the successful completion of the contract or the service order, the contract may be terminated by the
contracting officer for default or for the convenience of the Government, as appropriate.  If the contracting officer finds the contractor at
fault for the condition, the contract price or fixed fee may be equitably adjusted downward to compensate the Government for any resultant
delay, loss, or damage.



H.2 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY LEVEL I OR LEVEL II ACCESS APPROVAL (JUL 2007)


   The proposer/Contractor must identify all individuals and propose the level of Information Technology (IT) approval for each, using the
following guidance. The NRC sponsoring office shall make the final determination of the level, if any, of IT approval required for all
individuals working under this contract. The Government shall have and exercise full and complete control and discretion over granting, denying,
withholding, or terminating IT access approvals for individuals performing work under this contract.

   The Contractor shall conduct a preliminary security interview or review for each IT level I or II access approval Contractor applicant and
submit to the Government only the names of candidates that have a reasonable probability of obtaining the level of IT security access for which
the candidate has been proposed. The Contractor will pre-screen its applicants for the following:

     (a)    felony arrest in the last seven years; (b) alcohol related arrest within the last five years; (c) record of any military courts-
martial convictions in the past ten years; (d)     illegal use of narcotics or other controlled substances possession in the past year, or
illegal purchase, production, transfer, or distribution of arcotics or other controlled substances in the last seven years; (e) delinquency on
any federal debts or bankruptcy in the last seven years.

   The Contractor shall make a written record of its pre-screening interview or review (including any information to mitigate the responses to
items listed in (a) - (e)), and have the applicant verify the pre-screening record or review, sign and date it.  Two copies of the signed
Contractor's pre-screening record or review will be supplied to FSB/DFS with the Contractor employee's completed building access application
package.

   The Contractor shall further ensure that its employees, any subcontractor employees and consultants complete all IT access security
applications required by this clause within ten business days of notification by FSB/DFS of initiation of the application process.  Timely
receipt of properly completed records of the pre-screening record and IT access security applications (submitted for candidates that have a
reasonable probability of obtaining the level of security assurance necessary for access to NRC's facilities) is a contract requirement. Failure
of the Contractor to comply with this contract administration requirement may be a basis to cancel the award, or terminate the contract for
default, or offset from the contract's invoiced cost or price the NRC's incurred costs or delays as a result of inadequate pre-screening by the
Contractor.  In the event of cancellation or termination, the NRC may select another firm for contract award.

 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR IT LEVEL I

   Performance under this contract will involve prime Contractor personnel, subcontractors or others who perform services requiring direct
access to or operate agency sensitive information technology systems or data (IT Level I). The IT Level I involves responsibility for the
planning, direction, and implementation of a computer security program; major responsibility for the direction, planning, and design of a
computer system, including hardware and software; or the capability to access a computer system during its operation or maintenance in such a
way that could cause or that has a relatively high risk of causing grave damage; or the capability to realize a significant personal gain from
computer access.

favorably adjudication. However, temporary access authorization approval will be revoked and the employee may subsequently be denied IT access
in the event the employee's investigation cannot be favorably adjudicated.  Such an employee will not be authorized to work under any NRC
contract requiring IT access without the approval of FSB/DFS.  Where temporary access authorization has been revoked or denied, the Contractor
is responsible for assigning another individual to perform the necessary work under this contract without delay to the contract's performance
schedule, or without adverse impact to any other terms or conditions of the contract.  When an individual receives final IT access, the
individual will be subject to a review or reinvestigation every ten years.

   The Contractor shall submit a completed security forms packet, including the OPM Standard Form (SF) 85P (Questionnaire for Public Trust
Positions), two copies of the Contractor's signed pre-screening record and two FD 258 fingerprint charts, through the PO to FSB/DFS for review
and favorable adjudication, prior to the individual performing work under this contract.  The Contractor shall assure that all forms are
accurate, complete, and legible. Based on FSB/DFS review of the Contractor applicant's security forms and/or the receipt of adverse information
by NRC, the individual may be denied access to NRC facilities, sensitive information technology systems or data until a final determination is
made of his/her eligibility.

   In accordance with NRCAR 2052.204 70 "Security," IT Level II Contractors shall be subject to the attached NRC Form 187 (See Section J for
List of Attachments), SF- 85P, and Contractor's  record of the pre-screening which furnishes the basis for providing security requirements to
prime Contractors, subcontractors or others (e.g. bidders) who have or may have an NRC contractual relationship which requires access to or
operation of agency sensitive information technology systems or remote development and/or analysis of sensitive information technology systems
or data or other access to such systems or data; access on a continuing basis (in excess of more than 30 calendar days) to NRC buildings; or
otherwise requires issuance of an unescorted NRC badge.

                                 (End of Clause)





H.3  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR BUILDING ACCESS APPROVAL (JUL 2007)


   The Contractor shall ensure that all its employees, subcontractor employees or consultants who are assigned to perform the work herein for
contract performance for periods of more than 30 calendar days at NRC facilities, are approved by the NRC for unescorted NRC building access.

   The Contractor shall conduct a preliminary federal facilities security screening interview or review for each of its employee, subcontractor
employee, and consultants and submit to the NRC only the names of candidates for contract performance that have a reasonable probability of
obtaining approval necessary for access to NRC's federal facilities. The Contractor shall pre- screen its applicants for the following:

     (a) felony arrest in the last seven years; (b) alcohol related arrest within the last five years; (c) record of any military courts-martial
convictions in the past 10 years; (d) illegal use of narcotics or other controlled substances possession in the past year, or illegal purchase,
production, transfer, or distribution of narcotics or other controlled substances in the last seven years; (e) delinquency on any federal debts
or bankruptcy in the last seven years.

   The Contractor shall make a written record of its pre-screening interview or review (including any information to mitigate the responses to
items listed in (a) - (e)), and have the applicant verify the pre-screening record or review, sign and date it.  Two copies of the pre-screening
signed record or review shall be supplied to FSB/DFS with the Contractor employee's completed building access application package.

   The Contractor shall further ensure that its employees, any subcontractor employees and consultants complete all building access security
applications required by this clause within ten business days of notification by FSB/DFS of initiation of the application process.  Timely
receipt of properly completed records of the Contractor's signed pre-screening record or review and building access security applications
(submitted for candidates that have a reasonable probability of obtaining the level of security clearance necessary for access to NRC's
facilities) is a contract requirement.  Failure of the Contractor to comply with this contract administration requirement may be a basis to
cancel the award, or terminate the contract for default, or offset from the contract's invoiced cost or price the NRC's incurred costs or delays
as a result of inadequate pre-screening by the Contractor.  In the event of cancellation or termination, the NRC may select another firm for
contract award.

   A Contractor, subcontractor employee or consultant shall not have access to NRC facilities until he/she is approved by FSB/DFS.  Temporary
access may be approved based on a favorable NRC review and discretionary determination of their building access security forms.  Final building
access will be approved based on favorably adjudicated checks by the Government.  However, temporary access approval will be revoked and the
Contractor's employee may subsequently be denied access in the event the employee's investigation cannot be favorably determined by the NRC.
Such employee will not be authorized to work under any NRC contract requiring building access without the approval of FSB/DFS.  When an
individual receives final access, the individual will be subject to a review or reinvestigation every five years.

   The Government shall have and exercise full and complete control and discretion over granting, denying, withholding, or terminating building
access approvals for individuals performing work under this contract.  Individuals performing work under this contract at NRC facilities for a
period of more than 30 calendar days shall be required to complete and submit to the Contractor representative an acceptable OPM Form 85P
(Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions), and two FD 258 (Fingerprint Charts). Non-U.S. citizens must provide official documentation to the
FSB/DFS, as proof of their legal residency.  This documentation can be a Permanent Resident Card, Temporary Work Visa, Employment Authorization
Card, or other official documentation issued by the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.  Any applicant with less than two years
residency in the U. S. will not be approved for building access. The Contractor shall submit the documents to the NRC Project Officer (PO) who
will give them to FSB/DFS.

   FSB/DFS may, among other things, grant or deny temporary unescorted building access approval to an individual based upon its review of the
information contained in the OPM Form 85P and the Contractor's pre-screening record.  Also, in the exercise of its authority, the Government
may, among other things, grant or deny permanent building access approval based on the results of its review or investigation.  This submittal
requirement also applies to the officers of the firm who, for any reason, may visit the NRC work sites for an extended period of time during the
term of the contract.  In the event that FSB/DFS are unable to grant a temporary or permanent building access approval, to any individual
performing work under this contract, the Contractor is responsible for assigning another individual to perform the necessary function without
any delay in the contract's performance schedule, or without adverse impact to any other terms or conditions of the contract.  The Contractor is
responsible for informing those affected by this procedure of the required building access approval process (i.e., temporary and permanent
determinations), and the possibility that individuals may be required to wait until permanent building access approvals are granted before
beginning work in NRC's buildings.

 CANCELLATION OR TERMINATION OF BUILDING  ACCESS/ REQUEST

   The Contractor shall immediately notify the PO when a Contractor or subcontractor employee or consultant's need for NRC building access
approval is withdrawn or the need by the Contractor employee's for building access terminates.  The PO will immediately notify FSB/DFS (via e-
mail) when a Contractor employee no longer requires building access.  The Contractor shall be required to return any NRC issued badges to the
Project Officer for return to FSB/DFS within three days after their termination.



H.4  OFF RAMPS/ON RAMPS


   a) Off Ramp - The Government may cease to award task orders to contractors under the following conditions:  (1) the contractor fails to
      propose on at least (1) one task order in its relevant functional area during a 6-month period; (2) the contractor fails to propose on at
      least (1) one task order in its relevant functional area for at least sixty (60) percent of issued solicitations in the relevant functional
      area; or (3) a small business awardee becomes other than small business under the NAICS code for this acquisition. (FAR Subpart 1919.301-2)

   b) On Ramp – As off ramps are implemented, new sources may be awarded new contracts in one or more functional areas.  The Government will
      determine if it is in Government’s best interest to “on-ramp” and reopen the original solicitation to conduct a competitive solicitation
      process that may result in the addition of new contractors.   


   c) On Ramp Procedures - The Government reserves the right to reopen competition for awardees in any of the five functional areas at any time
      during the term of this acquisition.  In the event an on-ramp procedure is used, the Government will advertise the reopening of the
      competition on www.fbo.gov, and awardees shall meet the criteria established in the initial solicitation.  The evaluation and selection of
      awardees for any on-ramp will be exactly the same evaluation and award criteria used for the initial basic contact award.  The anticipated
      number of awards for any small business and Full &Open pools of competition will be announced in the reopening announcement posted on
      www.fbo.gov.  Any new awardees will compete with the remaining contractors in the applicable FA for task order(s) in the appropriate FA. 
      Any additional contractor(s) added due to on-ramp procedure(s) will not impact the maximum value for this acquisition; and the period of
      performance for new awardees will not extend beyond the terms specified for the applicable FA from the original IDIQ contract(s) that were
      awarded in that FA.  The Government will not consider unsolicited requests from sources to be added to a FA on a noncompetitive basis.

H.11  FOREIGN OWNERSHIP, CONTROL, OR INFLUENCE OVER CONTRACTOR


 (a) For purposes of this clause, a foreign interest is defined as any of the following:

   (1) A foreign Government or foreign Government agency;

   (2) Any form of business enterprise organized under the laws of any country other than the United States or its possessions;

   (3) Any form of business enterprise organized or incorporated under the laws of the U.S., or a State or other jurisdiction within the U.S.,
which is owned, controlled, or influenced by a foreign Government, agency, firm, corporation or person; or

   (4) Any person who is not a U.S. citizen.

 (b) Foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) may be present where the degree of ownership, control, or influence over a contractor by a
foreign interest is such that a reasonable basis exists for concluding that the compromise or unauthorized disclosure of classified information
may occur.

 (c) For purposes of this clause, subcontractor means any subcontractor at any tier and the term "Contracting Officer" shall mean NRC
Contracting Officer. When this clause is included in a subcontract, the term "contractor" shall mean subcontractor and the term "contract" shall
mean subcontract.

 (d) The contractor shall immediately provide the contracting officer written notice of any changes in the extent and nature of FOCI over the
contractor which would affect the answers to the questions presented in DD Form 441S, "Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interest".  Further,
notice of changes in ownership or control which are required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade
Commission, or the Department of Justice shall also be furnished concurrently to the contracting officer.

 (e) In those cases where a contractor has changes involving FOCI, the NRC must determine whether the changes will pose an undue risk to the
common defense and security. In making this determination, the contracting officer shall consider proposals made by the contractor to avoid or
mitigate foreign influences.

 (f) The contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause including this paragraph (g) in all
subcontracts under this contract that will require access to classified information.  Additionally, the contractor shall require such
subcontractors to submit completed information required on the DD Form 441 form prior to award of a subcontract. Information to be provided by a
subcontractor pursuant to this clause may be submitted directly to the contracting officer.

 (g) Information submitted by the contractor or any affected subcontractor as required pursuant to this clause shall be treated by NRC to the
extent permitted by law, as business or financial information submitted in confidence to be used solely for purposes of evaluating FOCI.

the contract. This clause shall not operate as a limitation on NRC's rights, including its rights to terminate this contract.

 (i) The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for default either if the contractor fails to meet obligations imposed by this clause,
e.g., provide the information required by this clause, comply with the contracting officer's instructions about safeguarding classified
information, or make this clause applicable to subcontractors, or if, in the contracting officer's judgment, the contractor creates a FOCI
situation in order to avoid performance or a termination for default. The contracting officer may terminate this contract for convenience if the
contractor becomes subject to FOCI and for reasons other than avoidance of performance of the contract, cannot, or chooses not to, avoid or
mitigate the FOCI problem.


H.12  INTERNET "COOKIES"


   Neither NRC nor its third party contractors that manage or develop the NRC web site shall send persistent cookies, place persistent cookies
on users' computers, nor collect personally identifiable information from visitors to the NRC web site unless in addition to clear and

the agency.


H.13  Safety of On-Site Contractor Personnel


 Ensuring the safety of occupants of Federal buildings is a responsibility shared by the professionals implementing our security and safety
programs and the persons being protected.  The NRC's Office of Administration (ADM) Division of Facilities and Security (DFS) has coordinated an
Occupant Emergency Plan (OEP) for NRC Headquarters buildings with local authorities.  The OEP has been approved by the Montgomery County Fire
and Rescue Service.  It is designed to improve building occupants' chances of survival, minimize damage to property, and promptly account for
building occupants when necessary.

 The contractor shall ensure that all personnel working full time on-site at NRC Headquarters read the NRC's OEP, provided electronically on the
NRC Intranet at http://www.internal.nrc.gov/ADM/oep.pdf.   The contractor's Project Director also shall emphasize to each staff member that they
are to be familiar with and guided by the OEP, as well as by instructions given by emergency response personnel in situations which pose an
immediate health or safety threat to building occupants.

 The NRC Project Officer shall ensure that the contractor has communicated the requirement for on-site contractor staff to follow the guidance
in the OEP.  The NRC Project Officer also will assist in accounting for on-site contract persons in the event of a major emergency (e.g.,
explosion occurs and casualties or injuries are suspected) during which a full evacuation will be required, including the assembly and
accountability of occupants.  The NRC DFS will conduct drills periodically to train occupants and assess these procedures.


H.14 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED MATTER OR INFORMATION (JUL 2007)


   Performance under this contract will require access to classified matter or information (National Security Information or Restricted Data) in
accordance with the attached NRC Form 187 (See List of Attachments).  Prime contractor personnel, subcontractors or others performing work under
this contract shall require a "Q" security clearance (allows access to Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential National Security Information and
Restricted Data) or a "L" security clearance (allows access to Secret and Confidential National Security Information and/or Confidential
Restricted Data).

   The proposer/contractor must identify all individuals to work under this contract and propose the type of security clearance required for
each.  The NRC sponsoring office shall make the final determination of the type of security clearance required for all individuals working under
this contract.

   The contractor shall conduct a preliminary security interview or review for each security clearance contractor, subcontractor employee and
consultant and submit to the Government only the names of candidates that have a reasonable probability of obtaining the level of security
clearance for which the candidate has been proposed. The Contractor will pre-screen applicants for the following:

     (a)    pending criminal charges or proceedings; (b) felony arrest records including alcohol related arrest within the last seven years; (c)
record of any military courts-martial charges and proceedings in the last seven years and courts-martial convictions in the last ten years; (d)
any involvement in hate crimes; (e) involvement in any group or organization that espouses extra-legal violence as a legitimate means to an end;
(f) dual or multiple citizenship including the issuance of a foreign passport in the last seven years; (g) illegal use possession, or
distribution of narcotics or other controlled substances within the last seven years; (h) financial issues regarding delinquent debts, liens,
garnishments, bankruptcy and civil court actions in the last seven years.

   The contractor will make a written record of their pre-screening interview or review (including any information to mitigate the responses to
items listed in (a) - (h)), and have the candidate verify the record, sign and date it.  Two copies of the signed interview record or review
will be supplied to FSB/DFS with the applicant's completed security application package.

   The contractor will further ensure that all contractor employees, subcontractor employees and consultants for classified information access
approval complete all security applications required by this clause within ten business days of notification by FSB/DFS of initiation of the
application process.  Timely receipt of properly completed security applications (submitted for candidates that have a reasonable probability of
obtaining the level of security clearance for which the candidate has been proposed) is a contract requirement.  Failure of the contractor to
comply with this condition may be a basis to cancel the award, or terminate the contract for default, or offset from the contract's invoiced
cost or price the NRC's incurred costs or delays as a result of inadequate pre-screening by the contractor.  In the event of termination or
cancellation, the Government may select another firm for contract award.

   Such contractor personnel shall be subject to the NRC contractor personnel security requirements of NRC Management Directive (MD) 12.3, Part
I and 10 CFR Part 10.11, which is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this contract as though fully set forth herein, and will
require a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) for "Q" clearances or a favorably adjudicated Limited Background
Investigation (LBI) for "L" clearances.

 A contractor employee shall not have access to classified information until he/ she is granted a security clearance by FSB/DFS, based on a
favorably adjudicated investigation.  In the event the contractor employee's investigation cannot be favorably adjudicated, any interim approval
could possibly be revoked and the individual could be subsequently removed from performing under the contract.  If interim approval access is
revoked or denied, the contractor is responsible for assigning another individual to perform the necessary work under this contract without
delay to the contract's performance schedule, or without adverse impact to any other terms or conditions of the contract. The individual will be
subject to a reinvestigation every five years for "Q" clearances and every ten years for "L" clearances.

   The contractor shall submit a completed security forms packet, including the SF-86, "Questionnaire for National Security Positions," and
fingerprint charts, through the PO to FSB/DFS for review and submission to the Office of Personnel Management for investigation.  The individual
may not work under this contract until FSB/DFS has granted them the appropriate security clearance, read, understand, and sign the SF 312,
"Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement."  The contractor shall assure that all forms are accurate, complete, and legible (except for
Part 2 of the questionnaire, which is required to be completed in private and submitted by the individual to the contractor in a sealed
envelope), as set forth in NRC MD 12.3.  Based on FSB/DFS review of the applicant's investigation, the individual may be denied his/her security
clearance in accordance with the due process procedures set forth in MD 12.3, E. O. 12968, and 10 CFR Part 10.11.

   In accordance with NRCAR 2052.204 70 cleared contractors shall be subject to the attached NRC Form 187 (See Section J for List of
Attachments), MD 12.3, SF- 86 and contractor's signed record or review of the pre-screening which furnishes the basis for providing security
requirements to prime contractors, subcontractors or others who have or may have an NRC contractual relationship which requires access to
classified information.

 CANCELLATION OR TERMINATION OF SECURITY CLEARANCE ACCESS/REQUEST

   When a request for clearance investigation is to be withdrawn or canceled, the contractor shall immediately notify the PO by telephone in
order that he/she can immediately contact FSB/DFS so that the investigation may be promptly discontinued.  The notification shall contain the
full name of the individual, and the date of the request.  Telephone notifications must be promptly confirmed in writing by the Contractor to
the PO who will forward the confirmation via email to FSB/DFS.  Additionally, FSB/DFS must be immediately notified in writing when an individual
no longer requires access to Government classified information, including the voluntary or involuntary separation of employment of an individual
who has been approved for or is being processed for access under the NRC "Personnel Security Program."


H.15  NRC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECURITY TRAINING  (AUG 2003)


 NRC contractors shall ensure that their employees, consultants, and subcontractors with access to the agency's information technology (IT)
equipment and/or IT services complete NRC's online initial and refresher IT security training requirements to ensure that their knowledge of IT
threats, vulnerabilities, and associated countermeasures remains current.  Both the initial and refresher IT security training courses generally
last an hour or less and can be taken during the employee's regularly scheduled work day.

 Contractor employees, consultants, and subcontractors shall complete the NRC's online, "Computer Security Awareness" course on the same day
that they receive access to the agency's IT equipment and/or services, as their first action using the equipment/service.  For those contractor
employees, consultants, and subcontractors who are already working under this contract, the on-line training must be completed in accordance
with agency Network Announcements issued throughout the year 2003 within three weeks of issuance of this modification.

 Contractor employees, consultants, and subcontractors who have been granted access to NRC information technology equipment and/or IT services
must continue to take IT security refresher training offered online by the NRC throughout the term of the contract.  Contractor employees will
receive notice of  NRC's online IT security refresher training requirements through agency-wide notices.

 The NRC reserves the right to deny or withdraw contractor use or access to NRC IT equipment and/or services, and/or take other appropriate
contract administrative actions (e.g., disallow costs, terminate for cause) should the Contractor violate the Contractor's responsibility under
this clause.

   In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget's guidance to Federal agencies and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC)
implementing policy and procedures, a contractor (including subcontractors and contractor employees), who performs work on behalf of the NRC, is
responsible for protecting, from unauthorized access or disclosure, personally identifiable information (PII) that may be provided, developed,
maintained, collected, used, or disseminated, whether in paper, electronic, or other format, during performance of this contract.

   A contractor who has access to NRC owned or controlled PII, whether provided to the contractor by the NRC or developed, maintained,
collected, used, or disseminated by the contractor during the course of contract performance, must comply with the following requirements:

   (1)  General.  In addition to implementing the specific requirements set forth in this clause, the contractor must adhere to all other
applicable NRC guidance, policy and requirements for the handling and protection of NRC owned or controlled PII.  The contractor is responsible
for making sure that it has an adequate understanding of such guidance, policy and requirements.

   (2)  Use, Ownership, and Nondisclosure.  A contractor may use NRC owned or controlled PII solely for purposes of this contract, and may not
collect or use such PII for any purpose outside the contract without the prior written approval of the NRC Contracting Officer.  The contractor
must restrict access to such information to only those contractor employees who need the information to perform work under this contract, and
must ensure that each such contractor employee (including subcontractors' employees) signs a nondisclosure agreement, in a form suitable to the
NRC Contracting Officer, prior to being granted access to the information.  The NRC retains sole ownership and rights to its PII. Unless the
contract states otherwise, upon completion of the contract, the contractor must turn over all PII in its possession to the NRC, and must certify
in writing that it has not retained any NRC owned or controlled PII except as otherwise authorized in writing by the NRC Contracting Officer.

develop and implement a security plan setting forth adequate procedures for the protection of NRC owned or controlled PII as well as the
procedures which the contractor must follow for notifying the NRC in the event of any security breach. The plan will be incorporated into the
contract and must be implemented and followed by the contractor once it has been approved by the NRC Contracting Officer.  If the contract does
not include a security plan at the time of contract award, a plan must be submitted for the approval of the NRC Contracting Officer within 30
days after contract award.

I.3  52.212-4  CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUN 2010)


   (a) Inspection/Acceptance. The contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The
Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require
repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If
repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or
adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services.  The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights-

     (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and

     (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

   (b) Assignment. The contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a
bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31

shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.

   (e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.

sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common
carriers. The contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any
excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and
shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

         (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.

         (B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor

purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the
specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.

     (5) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise

       (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.

       (iii) Final decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if--

         (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt within 30 days;

         (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand
for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or

         (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see 32.607-2).

       (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the

sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and
all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the
contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can

   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance
on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review
and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is
current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute
for a properly executed contractual document.

     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and
(C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the
notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning
of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect
an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the
CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.

     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in
a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.

     (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as
promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.

     (4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after
acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct
services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this
clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours
incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise
specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance
materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when
required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]

     (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement
or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may--

increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or

         (B) Terminate this contract for cause.

       (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the
contract.

     (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or
replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is
due to--

       (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or

       (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's
managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.

     (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and
services originally delivered under this contract.

     (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery
do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.

     (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be
governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31
U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not
assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.

   (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.

   (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). Failure of the parties to this
contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be
a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor
shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.

   (e) Definitions.

     (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause--

       (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection
with the furnishing of the end product or service.

by the Contracting Officer:

       (i) Hourly rate.

         (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor
hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.

         (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.
Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is
performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting
Officer.

         (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the
Contracting Officer or the authorized representative.

         (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including
any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records
that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the
contract.

         (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having
performed work on an overtime basis.

           (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates
shall be negotiated.

           (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.

           (3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the
overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.

       (ii) Materials.

         (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such
materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--

           (1) Quantities being acquired; and

           (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.

         (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the
actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the
Contractor--

           (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or

           (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

         (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall--

           (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials;
and

           (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable
to the contract.

         (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed.

           (1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such
costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause:

           (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect
costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price:

     (2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling
price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all
obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and
material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously
accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised
estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the
performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be
substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised
estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this
contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less
than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of
effort to be required under the contract.

     (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule,
and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless
and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a
revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set
forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before
the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the
ceiling price.

     (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will
have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting
Officer):

       (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories
specified in the contract;

       (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as
substantiation for payment--

         (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);

         (B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;

         (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and

         (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown
on the invoices.

       (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost--

         (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and

         (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.

     (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices,
that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to
increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The
Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If
the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor
shall--

       (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the--

         (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);

         (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;

         (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and

         (D) Contractor point of contact.

       (ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.

     (6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due
until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the
Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the
amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.

       (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.

       (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if--

         (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner;

         (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand
for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or

         (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2).

       (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the
same due date as the original demand for payment.

       (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:

         (A) The date fixed under this contract.

         (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.

       (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on--

         (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;

         (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit
against the contract debt; or

         (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.

       (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition
Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.

       (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation,
and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties
agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following
completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in
writing) from the date of completion.

     (7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of
final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract,
a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or
under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.

       (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.

       (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of
performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives
notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor
that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.

       (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against
patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.

     (8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment

specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.

   (j) Risk of loss. Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss or damage to the supplies provided under this contract

all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct
labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the
effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus
reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have
resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for
this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any
work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.

   (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the
Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with
adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any
amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided
by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination
for convenience.

   (n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon
acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.

   (o) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular
purpose described in this contract.

   (p) Limitation of liability. Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for
consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items.

   (q) Other compliances. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations
applicable to its performance under this contract.

   (r) Compliance with laws unique to Government contracts. The Contractor agrees to comply with 31 U.S.C. 1352 relating to limitations on the
use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracts; 18 U.S.C. 431 relating to officials not to benefit; 40 U.S.C. 3701, et seq.,
Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act; 41 U.S.C. 51-58, Anti-Kickback Act of 1986; 41 U.S.C. 265 and 10 U.S.C. 2409 relating to
whistleblower protections; 49 U.S.C. 40118, Fly American; and 41 U.S.C. 423 relating to procurement integrity.

   (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:

this clause.

     (3) The clause at 52.212-5.

     (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.

     (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.

     (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.

     (7) The Standard Form 33.

     (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments

     (9) The specification.

   (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

     (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance
on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review
and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is
current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute
for a properly executed contractual document.

     (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and
(C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the
notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.

       (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning
of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

     (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect
an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the
CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.

     (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

I.14 SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE APPLICABILITY


In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105 - 220),
August 7, 1998 to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities.

Specifically, Section 508 of that Act requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information
technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by
Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency.

All contractor deliverables for electronic and information technology (EIT), as defined in FAR 2.101, shall conform to the applicable Access
Board Section 508 standards.  The Performance Work Statement (PWS) for each task order will identify the applicable Section 508 standards for
that task order.  See www.section508.gov for more information regarding Section 508.

       (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.  For line items covered by the
WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy
American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer
determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the
solicitation.

   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
-

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against
them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of
any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount
that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when
full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

       (ii) Examples.

         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court
review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court
review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further
appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is
in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

     (1) Listed end products.

Listed End Product     Listed Countries of Origin




     (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision,

the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or
indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those
efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.

   (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to
this solicitation is predominantly--

     (1) __ In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States
exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or

     (2) __ Outside the United States.

   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance
with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt
services.)

     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not
certify that--

       (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or
traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of
normal business operations;

       (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

       (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as
that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

     [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

       (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or
subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;

       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(d)(2)(iii));

       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a
monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the
contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and

       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that
used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--

       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1)
or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this
information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

     (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection
requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued
by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with
the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the
TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.

     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).

       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.

       [  ] TIN has been applied for.

       [  ] TIN is not required because:

   provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and
   conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for
receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of
offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the
sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for
satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
      (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office
      designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt
      is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
      (2)
      (i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the
      exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting
      Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
      (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of
      entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
      (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was
      under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
      (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be
      considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
      (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation
      on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
      personnel.
      (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government
      office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude
      amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed
      to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
      (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response
      to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile
      received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning
      facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for
      receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions
with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However,
the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may
reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government
reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror
specifies otherwise in the offer.

           (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors
           using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs
           (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision.
      (2) The first page of the proposal must show --
           (i) The solicitation number;
           (ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available);
           (iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and
           agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item;
           (iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on
           the offeror’s behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and
           (v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal. Proposals signed by an agent shall be accompanied by
           evidence of that agent’s authority, unless that evidence has been previously furnished to the issuing office.
      (3) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.
           (i) Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modification, or revisions, so as to reach the Government office
           designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for
           receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due.
           (ii)
                 (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact
                 time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the
                 Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and --
                       (1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the
                       initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date
                       specified for receipt of proposals; or
                       (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt
                       of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
                       (3) It is the only proposal received.
                 (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will
                 be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
           (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that
           installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or
           statements of Government personnel.
           (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office
           designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude
           amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day
           specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
           (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations
           may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any
           time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn
           in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the
           person signs a receipt for the proposal before award.
      (4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items.
      (5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in
      U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.
      (6) Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit
      modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award.
      (7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer.
      (8)  Offerors are only permitted to submit one proposal per Functional Area in accordance with the terms and condition of the solicitation.
       Section (e) of FAR Clause 52.212-1 does not apply this solicitation.
      (9) Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer.
(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover
sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror).
(e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for
any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall --
      (1) Mark the title page with the following legend:
           This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in
           whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a
           result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose
           the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information
           contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained
           in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
      (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
           Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) Contract award.
      (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose
      proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
      (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.
      (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
      (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described
      in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical
      standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If
      the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at
      which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the
      greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
      (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or
      prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
      (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the
      Government’s best interest to do so.
      (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
      (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or
      subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is
      significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if
      the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
      (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or
      schedule risk.
      (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the
      proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
           (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if
           applicable:
           (i) The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror’s offer.
           (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance
           information on the debriefed offeror.
           (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
           (iv) A summary of the rationale for award.
           (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
           (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in
           the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

     b) All pages of Volumes I, II, and IV shall be numbered.  Subsequent proposal revisions, if applicable, shall also include revision number
        and date.  A table of contents may also be provided with figures and tables listed separately.


     c) The offeror is required to submit two electronic copies of the offeror’s proposal, designating one copy as “back-up,” in addition to the
        hardcopies specified above.  The electronic copies must be readable by Microsoft Word and Excel version 2003 or later.  Cost/Price
        proposal files shall use Microsoft Excel 2003 or later.  Electronic files of Volumes I, II, III, and IV shall be on virus free CD-ROM
        (CD-R format) discs with an external label indicating:  (1) the name of the offeror, (2) the solicitation number, (3) the format and
        software versions used, (4) a list of the files contained on the disk, (5) the Functional Area, and (6) date of the information.  In the
        event of any inconsistency between data provided on electronic media and hard copies, the hard copy data will take precedence.

     d) The format for each proposal volume and supporting documentation must be tailored to assure that all information reflects a one-to-one
        relationship to the Section M evaluation factors and sub-factors.


     e) Proposal Volume II should not contain any reference to cost/price.  However, resource information, such as data concerning labor hours
        and categories, materials, subcontracts, travel, computer time, etc., must be included in Volume II so that the offeror's proposal may
        be appropriately evaluated.


     f) Statements which paraphrase solicitation requirements without communicating the specific approach proposed by the offeror, or statements
        to the effect that the offeror's understanding can or will comply with the statement of work may be construed as an indication of the
        offeror's lack of understanding of the statement of work and objectives.

     g) Information contained in Volume II should be precise, factual, detailed and complete.  The offeror shall not assume that the NRC is
        aware of its abilities, capabilities, plans, facilities, organization or any other pertinent fact that is important to accomplishment of
        the work as specified in the solicitation.  With the exception of past performance information, the Government will rely strictly on the
        information contained in the submitted in each proposal to evaluate that proposal.  To the extent that information in one proposal
        volume may apply to the Government’s evaluation of another proposal volume, the Government may use that information accordingly.

      percentage of use of the small business concerns listed below; and the offeror’s procedures to ensure successful achievement of such
      projected percentages.  The other than small business offeror's proposed small business subcontracting plan shall ensure that small
      businesses, including those identified in clause 52.219-9, have the maximum practical opportunity to participate in contract performance
      based upon the total dollars planned to be subcontracted.  The target small business subcontracting goals for applicable NRC procurements
      reflect the Federal-wide small business goals and are as follows:


                  23% for Small Business
                  5% for Small Disadvantaged Business
                  5% for Woman-Owned Small Business
                  3% for Veteran-Owned Small Business
                  3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business
                  3% for HUBZone-Owned Small Business


An “other than small business” offeror shall also provide the procedures they will implement to ensure timely payment to small business
subcontractors and their commitment to designate a senior executive to oversee the organization's Small Business Subcontracting Program.


M.5 COST/PRICE FACTOR (VOLUME III)


The Government will evaluate the Volume III submission for each functional area to determine (a) whether all required labor categories for that
functional area are proposed and include proposed fixed hourly rates; (b) the extent to which the offeror complied with FAR clause 52.216-31.
In addition, the Government will calculate the average of the offerors proposed hourly rates for each of the 10 years and add those averages
together to derive the evaluated cost/price for that proposal for source selection purposes.
