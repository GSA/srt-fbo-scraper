SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT C.1 BACKGROUND Today's 21st century world is all about speed of getting tasks completed through accelerated delivery. This pace is now being translated to highway construction for the 21st century. Technology is the key to delivering highway construction for this new century. It has been said by FHWA and the three national associations American Association State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), American Road and Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA), and Associated General Contractors of America (AGC) who are jointly promoting Civil Integrated Management (CIM), "With limited resources and public expectations higher than ever, all parties to highway construction projects must work together and utilize emerging technologies for the fast, efficient, and safe delivery of projects to highlight these types of resources." CIM is the collection, mechanism, and managed accessibility to accurate data and information related to a highway facility. This concept can be used by engineering groups for many purposes; planning, environmental, surveying, construction, maintenance, asset management, and risk assessment. In the CIM effort there is a need to utilize Intelligent Construction and Systems and Technologies (ICST), where ICST is defined as systems and technologies that provide information to increase the speed, efficiency and/or safety during the construction process. Some of the technology areas and challenges that exist in ICST are as follows: Information Modeling ­ There is a lack of design procedures documented in a design manual on how to properly generate accurate 3/4/5 D models for downstream uses in construction and other phases of project delivery standardized base and documented change in workflow. There is a need to identify the elements, guidance, applications, etc. that are needed to develop means and methods for optimizing construction, earthwork balancing, equipment automatic machine guidance (AMG) control systems, and modeling software. Surveying ­ The processes, guidance, applications, etc. needed to develop the use of standards for Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), creating equipment flexibility, precision and accuracy of survey, and laser total stations are needed. Utilities ­There are efforts underway researching utility technologies and processes, including Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) RO1(A),(B),(C); "Technologies to Support Storage, Retrieval, and Utilization of 3-D Utility Location Data", "Utility Locating Technology Development Utilizing Multi-Sensor Platforms", "Innovation in Location of Deep Utility Pipes and Tunnels", and R15 "Strategies for Integrating Utility and Transportation Agency Priorities in Highway Renewal Projects" respectively. In addition, Transportation Research Board (TRB) National Center for Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 20-05 Synthesis Topic 44-11 "Managing Longitudinal Utility Installations on Controlled Access Highway Right-Of-Way". Finally, FHWA's Research for "Feasibility of Mapping and Marking Utilities" awarded to Texas A&M Transportation Institute. The work under this project is to identify what issues are not being adequately covered by these other efforts. There may be gaps, however, that are not being addressed by the abovementioned effort. Real Time Verification ­ There is a need to identify gaps in real time verification

Addressing Challenges in Intelligent Construction Systems and Technologies (ICST) DTFH61-13-R-00024 Page 4 of 50

technologies. Currently, an example of an integrated construction tool, intelligent compaction (IC), has been researched through pooled fund studies and FHWA's research "Accelerated Implementation of Intelligent Compaction Technology for Embankment Subgrade Soils, Aggregate Base, and Asphalt Pavement Materials Pavement Thermal Imaging" and other state research. There are, however, other technologies capable of providing real time verification of construction quality such as RFID Technology for tracking material quantities and certification transmittals, in cab weigh scales, "Z" component for HMA overruns and/or digital jobsite, video surveillance inspection and recording. Data Management ­ There is a need to have websites and clearinghouses for best practices and types of technology systems, quality assurance (QA) guidance of the data coming in and going out, "Big Data" capabilities for analytics, engineering estimate programs, cloud and data storage, and asset management systems. Costs/Benefits and Resources ­ Ultimately there is a need to determine the return on investment (ROI) on the use of ICST. In addition, information is needed on the types of costs and resources required by industry and agencies for implementation of these technologies. C.2 OBJECTIVE The primary objectives of this project are to: 1. Address gaps identified for ICST from project development through construction; 2. Develop guidance for State highway agencies to assist them in determining how best to use ICST to improve accelerated delivery. C.3 SCOPE The scope of the study covers various types, sizes and scopes of transportation projects using ICST delivered by State highway agencies. The study involves collecting, organizing and analyzing data from various State highway agencies and other facility owners using ICST. Under this contract, the contractor shall address the following objectives: 1. Develop design procedures, design manuals, applications, etc. for highway agencies to properly generate accurate 3/4/5 D models for downstream uses in construction and other phases of project delivery standardized base 2. Document ICST success stories and best practices, and best uses for individual technologies. 3 Document the types of costs and resources required by industry and agencies for implementation of these technologies, and their associated return on investment. 4. Document the ICST challenges in the areas of surveying, utilities, real time verification, and data management 5. Provide a technology development plan to address the challenges and opportunities encountered in the project.

SECTION H - SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS H.1 CONTRACT START UP The Contractor shall be prepared to perform all work set forth in Section C upon the effective date of the Contract. H.2 PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY The Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management, is the only agency that is authorized to modify, suspend, or terminate performance under this Contract. H.3 DISSEMINATION OF CONTRACT INFORMATION The Contractor shall not publish, permit to be published, or distribute information, oral or written, concerning the results or conclusions made pursuant to the performance of this contract, without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer. Two copies of any material proposed to be published or distributed shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer, and one copy to the COR. H.4 POST-AWARD EVALUATION OF CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE Contractor Performance Evaluations a. Interim and final evaluations of contractor performance will be prepared on this contract in accordance with FAR 42.1502 and TAM 1242.1502. The final performance evaluations will be prepared at the time of completion of work. b. The Contractor can elect to review the evaluation and submit additional information or a rebuttal statement. The contractor will be permitted 30 calendar days to respond. Contractor response is voluntary. If the contractor does not respond within 30 days, the Government will presume that the contractor has no comment. Any disagreement between the parties regarding an evaluation will be referred to an individual at a level above the Contracting Officer, whose decision is final. c. Copies of the evaluations, contractor responses, and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the contract file, and may be used to support future award decisions. Federal Highway Administration utilizes the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to record and maintain past performance information. CPARS hosts a suite of web-enabled applications that are used to document contractor performance information that is required by Federal Regulations. The CPARS module assesses performance on contracts for Systems, Services,

Addressing Challenges in Intelligent Construction Systems and Technologies (ICST) DTFH61-13-R-00024 Page 19 of 50

Information Technology, and Operations Support. The Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) module assesses performance on Architect-Engineer contracts. The Construction Contractor Appraisal Support System (CCASS) module assesses performance on Construction contracts. CPARS reference material can be accessed at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/cparsfiles/cpars/refmatl.htm. The registration process requires the contractor to identify an individual that will serve as a primary contact. This individual will be authorized access to the evaluation for review and comment. In addition, the contractor is encouraged to identify a secondary contact in the event the primary contact is unavailable to process the evaluation within the required 30-day time period. After the FHWA Contract Specialist registers the contract in CPARS, the contractor will receive a system generated e-mail notifying him/her that the contract is registered. A system generated e-mail will also provide the contractor with a User ID if the person does not already have a CPARS User ID. Once a performance evaluation has been prepared and is ready for comment, the contractor representative will receive a system generated e-mail notification that the performance evaluation is electronically available for review and comment. The contractor representative will receive an automated e-mail whenever an assessment is completed and can subsequently retrieve the completed assessment from CPARS. Contractors may access evaluations at www.cpars.csd.disa.mil for review and comment in CPARS. (End of clause)

users. H.9 REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTING SECTION 508 STANDARDS

The following applies to all FHWA Contracts issued on or after June 25, 2001, for Preparation of Technical reports or other documents that FHWA plans to post on a website. In addition to the work requirements specified in this statement of work, vendors must ensure that all electronic documents that they prepare will meet the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The act requires that all electronic products prepared for the Federal Government be accessible to persons with disabilities, including those with vision, hearing, cognitive, and mobility impairments. Vendors can view Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (http://www.accessboard.gov/508.htm) and the Federal IT Accessibility Initiative (Home Page) (http://section508.gov/) for detailed information. Applicable Standards The following standards have been determined to be applicable to this contract: ____X__1194.21 Software applications and operating systems. ____X_1194.22 Web-based intranet and Internet information and applications. _______1194.23 Telecommunications products. _______1194.24 Video and multimedia products. _______1194.25 Self contained closed products. _______1194.26 Desktop and portable computers. The FHWA has determined that the accessibility requirements contained in the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards, Section 1194.22, "Web-based intranet and internet information and applications," and Section 1194.24, "Video and Multi-media products," apply to this work. The standards are available at www.accessboard.gov/sec508/508standards.htm. The standards do not require the installation of specific accessibility-related software or the attachment of an assistive technology device, but merely require that the EIT be compatible with such software and devices so that it can be made accessible, if so required by the agency, in the future. The following paragraphs summarize the requirements for preparing FHWA reports in conformance with Section 508 for eventual posting by FHWA to an FHWA-sponsored website. If you have further questions, please contact the FHWA Contracting Officer's Representative listed in this statement of work. Electronic documents with images:

Addressing Challenges in Intelligent Construction Systems and Technologies (ICST) DTFH61-13-R-00024 Page 22 of 50

Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element in all publications prepared in electronic format. Use descriptions (such as, "alt" and "longdesc") for all non-text images or place them in element content. For all documents prepared, vendors must prepare one standard HTML format (as described in this statement of work) AND one text format that includes descriptions for all non-text images. "Text equivalent" means text sufficient to reasonably describe the image. For example, an image that is merely decorative requires only a very brief "text equivalent" description. However, if the image conveys information that is important to the content of the report, then text sufficient to reasonably describe that image and its purpose within the context of the report must be provided. Electronic documents with complex charts or data tables: When preparing tables that are heavily designed, provide adequate alternate information so that assistive technologies can read them out. Identify row and column headers for data tables. Provide the information in a non-linear form. Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. Electronic documents with forms: When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues. H. 10 DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST It is the Department of Transportation's (DOT) policy to award contracts to only those Offerors whose objectivity is not impaired because of any related past, present, or planned interest, financial or otherwise, in organizations regulated by DOT or in organizations whose interests may be substantially affected by Departmental activities. Based on this policy: The Offerors shall provide a statement in its proposal that describes in a concise manner all past, present or planned organizational, financial, contractual or other interest(s) with an organization regulated by DOT, or with an organization whose interests may be substantially affected by Departmental activities, and which is related to the work under this solicitation. The interest(s) described shall include those of the proposer, its affiliates, proposed consultants, proposed subcontractors and key personnel of any of the above. Past interest shall be limited to within one year of the date of the Offerors technical proposal. Key personnel shall include any person owning more than 20% interest in the Offerors, and the Offerors corporate officers, its senior managers and any employee who is responsible for making a decision or taking an action on this contract where the decision or action can have an economic or other impact on the interests of a regulated or affected organization.

Addressing Challenges in Intelligent Construction Systems and Technologies (ICST) DTFH61-13-R-00024 Page 23 of 50

The Offerors shall describe in detail why it believes, in light of the interest(s) identified in (a) above, that performance of the proposed contract can be accomplished in an impartial and objective manner. In the absence of any relevant interest identified in (a) above, the Offerors shall submit in its proposal a statement certifying that to its best knowledge and belief no affiliation exists relevant to possible conflicts of interest. The Offerors must obtain the same information from potential Subcontractors prior to award of a subcontract. The CO will review the statement submitted and may require additional relevant information from the Offerors. All such information, and any other relevant information known to DOT, will be used to determine whether an award to the Offerors may create a conflict of interest. If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the CO may (1) disqualify the Offerors, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the Offerors and include appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded. The refusal to provide the disclosure or representation, or any additional information required, may result in disqualification of the Offerors for award. If nondisclosure or misrepresentation is discovered after award, the resulting contract may be terminated. If after award the Contractor discovers a conflict of interest with respect to the contract awarded as a result of this solicitation, which could not reasonably have been know prior to award, an immediate and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the CO. The disclosure shall include a full description of the conflict, a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate such conflict. The CO may, however, terminate the contract for convenience if he or she deems that termination is in the best interest of the Government. (End of provision) H.11 LIMITATION ON FUTURE CONTRACTING It is agreed by the parties of this contract that the Contractor will be restricted in its future contracting with FHWA to the manner described below. Except as specifically provided in this clause, the Contractor shall be free to compete for FHWA business on an equal basis with other companies. If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, is required to develop specifications or statements of work, or materials leading directly, predictably or without delay to a statement of work to be used in the competitive procurement of a system or services, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described within that solicitation as a prime Contractor, subcontractor, Consultant, or in any capacity to any supplier under an ensuing FHWA contract. Such restrictions shall remain in effect for one year following the date of the initial solicitation.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.1 GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR AWARD OF CONTRACTS General: The Government intends to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract as a result of this solicitation. The contract resulting from this solicitation will be to the responsible Offerors whose proposals represent the "best value" after evaluation. Under this solicitation, the "best value" will be made on the basis of the proposal meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors. In other words, the "best value" will be made using a method in which when combined, Technical and Past Performance are significantly more important than Cost and allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or other than the highest technically acceptable rated Offeror. In making its selection decision, the Government will consider the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 1) Technical Factors as stated in Section M.2; 2) Cost and Business Evaluation; and 3) Past Performance Source Selection: Source selection will be made in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Department of Transportation Acquisition Regulation and this solicitation. Award of contract under this solicitation shall be made to an Offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit or obligate the Government to the expenditure of public funds. No cost chargeable to the proposed contract can be incurred before receipt of a fully executed contract or specific written authorization from the Contracting Officer. Amendment or Cancellation of Solicitation: FHWA reserves the right to amend or cancel this solicitation as necessary to meet FHWA requirements. Communication: Until a formal notice of award is issued, no communication by the Government either written or oral shall be interpreted as a promise that an award will be made. Note(s): An Offeror should not assume that the Contracting Officer will independently obtain information necessary to evaluate its proposal and should therefore supply all information required to evaluate its proposal. Failure to provide the information required in order to evaluate a proposal could result in rejection of the proposal as being "technically unacceptable".

COST AND BUSINESS PROPOSAL The Cost and Business Proposal will be analyzed and evaluated to determine the reasonableness of the Offeror's proposed cost. Cost proposals will also be analyzed to assess realism and probable cost to the Government. The purpose of this analysis will be to determine if the Offeror's proposed cost reasonably reflect that the Offeror understands and addresses the Government's requirement(s). The proposed costs may be adjusted, for the purpose of evaluation, based upon the results of the cost realism assessment.

3.

PAST PERFORMANCE The Government will evaluate the relevant merits of each offeror's past performance on the basis of its reputation with its former customers. The Government may review all or some of the following areas regarding past performance. The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage or disadvantage of the offeror. ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Quality of Service Timeliness of Performance Price/Cost Control Customer Satisfaction

M.3 BASIS FOR AWARD The government will accept the offer that is considered the most advantageous. Considering the evaluation factors outlined above, when combined, technical and past performance are significantly more important than cost. (End of Section M)
