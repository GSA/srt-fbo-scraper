PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) 



KIOSK and LAPTOP, Commander Navy Installations Command



1.   INTRODUCTION



Commander Navy Installations Command (CNIC), Fleet and Family Readiness (FFR) program, provides public use internet and computer access to eligible patrons within facilities such as liberty centers, libraries, child and youth programs, lodging, bowling centers, marinas and fleet and family support centers. These computers are used by patrons to access free internet within these facilities and also to participate in online training in a classroom environment. FFR is requiring a self service laptop management kiosk in order to check in/out laptop units within a self contained management station that ensures all units are readily available to eligible patrons.  Contractor shall be responsible for providing self service kiosk units to include laptops that can be managed locally and throughout the enterprise. These units will have a standard image and will be required to return to the original image once the unit has been returned to the kiosk or logged off from the actual laptop. These units must be self standing and work within our existing unofficial GOWIFI internet model that is currently utilized within all FFR facilities.





2.   BACKGROUND



CNIC, specifically FFR program, is responsible to provide an unofficial public access computer service to all eligible patrons within FFR facilities. Due to security and privacy concerns within the enterprise, the FFR franchise service department is required to replace all current field personal computers to include laptops or any device being used for public internet access with a managed solution to support public use. In order to provide eligible patrons laptops for public access to the internet FFR has been required to follow a public access security model to ensure all laptops are managed, monitored and have the proper controls in place to ensure all software is up to date and returned to its original state after each use. In order to manage all portable units, CNIC FFR is seeking a self service management kiosk to manage existing and new portable laptop computers from a central repository. These kiosk units must allow for management of hardware and software within a central unit that integrates into the current FFR GOWIFI unofficial internet model. CNIC FFR will replace all computer units housed in FFR facilities that are used by eligible patrons to support unofficial internet access. The kiosk management unit has been decided upon due to the flexible nature of the design and the ability to keep all units housed within kiosk patched, updated and managed in a manner that allows for tracking, inventory and management of all software from a central location. 



This requirement has stemmed from the need to not only provide patrons a secure and safe computer environment but also to keep up with current trends within the industry in management of public use computer assets. Research across the enterprise was conducted to determine the best and most flexible model for deployment and management of public access computers. It was determined based on the current personal computer model that a self service kiosk would not only meet a centrally managed enterprise model but also allow for a customer friendly interface that is easily supported.  Portable kiosk units will help FFR reduce furniture and infrastructure requirements while giving customers greater flexibility within its facilities to utilize computing devices in a manner that supports mobility.

Visiting contractors/vendors may obtain daily passes directly from the individual Navy Installations by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/background check.  Alternatively, if the contractor/vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment registration, backing vetting, screening, issuance of credentials at the contractor‚Äôs/vendor‚Äôs own cost through a designated independent contractor NCACS service provider.  Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed/renewed on an annual basis.  The  cost incurred to obtain Navy Installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price (s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials  will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract.  



	B.	NCACS (Navy Commercial Access Control System) Program uses the contracted security database system called RAPIDGate.  Effective 01 October 2010, Navy installations began phasing in participation in the initiative to increase security and streamline installation access by implementing the RAPIDGate ¬Æ Program for all vendors, contractors, sub-contractors and service providers who are not authorized a Common Access Card (CAC) and regularly access.  The patented program, offered by Eid Passport, Inc., will manage installation access for vendors, suppliers, service providers and Contractors.  The program is offered as a solution to mitigate the delays expected as a result of recent changes in Department of Defense (DoD) and Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) security directives requiring tighter security requirements to access Navy installation.  RAPIDGate ¬Æ Program participants receive a long-term access credential after they pass a background screening process and are approved by the installation.  Credentials are electronically scanned and verified by security personnel in a matter of a few seconds.  The program includes company enrollment, sponsorship, employee registration, employment status validation, identity authentication, background screening, biometric verification and entry authorization.  Contractors who choose not to participate in the program will be required to obtain daily passes at the pass office.  Badges/passes are the property of the Government and shall be displayed as required by the installation Security Department.  When an employee leaves the Contractor‚Äôs service, the employee‚Äôs pass and badge shall be returned in accordance with the guidelines of the issuing office.  Information on the RAPIDGate program can be obtained at the following website: . 



	C.	Personnel Access ‚Äì at a minimum all individuals are subject to screening and must be able to comply with the following criteria:



	1.	All personnel must be either United States citizens or possess proper alien worker 					documentation;



	2.	All personnel are subject to screening as registered sex offenders; and

L-5.	LATE SUBMISSIONS, MODIFICATIONS, AND WITHDRAWALS OF PROPOSALS



	a.	Any proposal received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless it is received before award is made and it



		(1)	was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date specified for receipt of offers (e.g., an offer submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt of offers by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th);



		(2)	was sent by mail or, if authorized by the solicitation, or via facsimile and it is determined by the NAFI that the late receipt was due solely to mishandling by the NAFI after receipt at the Government installation;



		(3)	 was sent by Express Mail (e.g. FedEx, UPS or postal service), not later than 5:00 P.M. at the place of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals.  The term "working days" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays; or



		(4)	is the only proposal received.



	b.	Any modification of a proposal or quotation, except a modification resulting from the Contracting Officer's request for "best and final" offer is subject to the same conditions above.



	c.	A modification resulting from the Contracting Officer's request for "best and final" offer received after the time and date specified in the request will not be considered unless received before award and the late receipt is due solely to mishandling by the NAFI after receipt at the Government installation.



	d.	The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late proposal or modification sent either by U.S. Postal Service registered or certified mail is the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark both on the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service.  Both postmarks must show a legible date or the proposal, quotation, or modification shall be processed as if mailed late.  "Postmark" means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of a postage meter machine impression) that is readily identifiable without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees of the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service on the date of mailing.  Therefore, offerors or quoters should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.



	e.	The only acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation is the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper or other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation.



	f.	The only acceptable evidence to establish the date of mailing of a late offer, modification, or withdrawal sent by ‚ÄúExpress Mail Service‚Äù is the date entered by the mail service receiving clerk on the "Express Mail Service" label and/or the postmark on both the envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the mail service provider.  "Postmark" has the same meaning as defined above, excluding postmarks of the Canadian Postal Service.  Therefore, offerors or quoters should request the postal clerk to place a legible hand cancellation bull's eye postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper.



	g.	Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this provision, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the NAFI will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.



	h.	Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award.  If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provisions entitled "Facsimile Proposals."  Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the representative's identity is made known and the representative signs a receipt for the proposals before award.



L-6.	RESTRICTION ON DISCLOSURE AND USE OF DATA



Offerors or quoters who include in their proposals or quotations data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose or used by the NAFI except for evaluation purposes, shall



	a.	Mark the title page with the following legend:  "This proposal or quotation includes data that shall not be disclosed in whole or in part - for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal or quotation.  If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror or quoter as a result of - or in connection with - the submission of this data, the NAFI shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract.  This restriction does not limit the NAFI's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.  The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets ___________ (insert numbers or other identification of sheets"; and



	b.	Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: "Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or quotation."









L-7.	EXPLANATION TO PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS



Any prospective offerors desiring an explanation or interpretation or interpretation of the solicitation requirements and/or contract line items must submit a written request via email to Jovencia.williams@navy.mil no later than 24 Dec 2012, 4:30 P.M., CST.  Oral explanations or instructions given before the award of the contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning a solicitation will be furnished promptly to all other prospective offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if that information is necessary in submitting offers or if the lack of it would be prejudicial to any other prospective offerors.



L-8.	FAILURE TO SUBMIT OFFER



Recipients of this solicitation not responding with an offer should not return this solicitation, unless it specifies otherwise.  Instead, they should advise the issuing office by letter or postcard whether they want to receive future solicitations for similar requirements.  If a recipient does not submit an offer and does not notify the issuing office that future solicitations are desired, the recipient's name may be removed from the applicable mailing list.



L-9.	CONTRACT AWARD - NEGOTIATED PROCUREMENT



	a.	The NAFI will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the NAFI, cost or price and other factors specified elsewhere in this solicitation, considered.



	b.	The NAFI may (1) reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest, (2) accept other than the lowest offer, and (3) waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.



	c.	The NAFI intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  However, the NAFI reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.



	d.	The NAFI may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.  Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may be submitted for quantities less than those specified.  The NAFI reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.



	e.	A written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the NAFI may accept an offer, or part of an offer, as provided above, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  Negotiations conducted after receipt of an offer do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the NAFI.



	f.	Neither financial data submitted with an offer, nor representations concerning facilities or financing, will form a part of the resulting contract.  However, if the resulting contract contains a clause providing for price reduction for defective cost or pricing data, the contract price will be subject to reduction if cost or pricing data furnished is incomplete, inaccurate, or not current.



	g.	The NAFI may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items.  An offer is materially unbalanced when it is based on prices which are significantly overstated in relation to cost for other work, and if there is a reasonable doubt that the offer will result in the lowest overall cost to the NAFI, even though it may be the low evaluated offer, or it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.



L-10.	TYPE OF CONTRACT



The NAFI contemplates award of a Single Award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm-Fixed-Price contract resulting from this solicitation for CLINs 0001; 0002, and 0003.  CLIN 0004 and CLIN 0005 are cost reimbursement CLINs.



PART IV, SECTION M: - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD



M-1.  EVALUATION AND AWARD FACTORS:  The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is the most advantageous to the NAFI, price and non-price factors considered presenting the best overall value to the NAFI.  The following non-cost factors along with price, listed in descending order of importance will be used to evaluate offers.



Factor No. 1 ‚Äì Technical (Technical capability to comply with requirements of Section C).

	

Factor No. 2 ‚Äì Past Performance

	

The source selected may not be the lowest price, but will be the most advantageous to the NAFI, price and other factors considered, presenting the best overall value to the NAFI.  This will be determined by comparing differences in the value of the non-cost features with differences in cost to the NAFI.  In making this comparison, non-cost factors when combined are approximately of equal importance to price.  



M-2. CLARIFICATIONS:  Communications with an offeror for clarifications may be necessary and are for the sole purpose of eliminating minor irregularities, informalities, or apparent clerical mistakes in the proposal.  Clarification does not give the offeror an opportunity to revise or modify its proposal, except to the extent that correction of apparent clerical mistakes results in a revision.



M-3.	EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS:  



a. Offeror‚Äôs proposals shall be examined and evaluated based on price and the other non-cost factors.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to provide information, which clearly demonstrates the ability to satisfactorily respond to the requirements of Section C.  All proposals must include price proposals to be considered for award.



b. Discussions may be conducted with all offerors determined to be in the competitive range.  HOWEVER, OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  THEREFORE, PROPOSALS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED INITIALLY ON THE MOST FAVORABLE TERMS WHICH THE OFFEROR CAN SUBMIT TO THE NAFI.  DO NO ASSUME THAT YOU WILL BE CONTACTED OR AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY, DISCUSS, OR REVISE YOUR PROPOSAL. 



M-4.	EVALUATION OF OPTIONS:  The NAFI will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the NAFI to exercise the option(s).
