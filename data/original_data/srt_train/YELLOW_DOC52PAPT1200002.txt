(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h)  Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals­ (1)  [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2)  [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3)  [ ] Are [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4)  [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i)  Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii)  Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B)  The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)  (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-ofname agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4)  Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2)  If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3)  Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.

Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B)  The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (C)  Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. (D)  When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract.

FAR 52.212-4 ­ July, 2010 edition

(3)  If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. (ii) Materials  . (A)  If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the-(1)  Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any  modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B)  Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor-(1)  Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2)  Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

(2)

Total  cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in
FAR 52.212-4 ­ July, 2010 edition

performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling  price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. Access  to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): (i)  Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii)  For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment-(A)  (B)  (C)  (D)  The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); The Contractor's timekeeping procedures; Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.

(4)

(iii)  For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost-(A)  Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B)  Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments  . Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall-(i)  Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-- (A)  Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); (B)  Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; (C)  Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and (D)  Contractor point of contact. (ii) (6)  (i) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.

FAR 52.212-4 ­ July, 2010 edition

(ii)  The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii)  Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if-- (A)  The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B)  The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C)  The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2). (iv)  If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v)  Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A)  The date fixed under this contract. (B)  The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi)  The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on-- (A)  The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B)  The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C)  The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. (7)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i)  Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or (ii)  The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (8)  This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. (9)  The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (10)  Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

FAR 52.212-4 ­ July, 2010 edition

(l)  Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.

1.0 1.1

BACKGROUND New State-of-the-Art Information Technology Infrastructures

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is re-designing the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure associated with various business units at the USPTO including services for the execution of a trademark examination process. The architecture is being designed to include a new service-oriented architecture, enterprise workflow management, content management and a new data model resulting in a fundamental redesign of trademark processing and operations. Due to the evolutionary nature of the existing Trademark IT system, it consists of many user interfaces developed overtime utilizing web services, sockets, database replication, batch processes, transactions, visual Basic, .Net, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Cobol, C++, WFL, and shell scripts. Operating Systems include HP-US, AIX, MCP, Windows, and Linux. Vendors are numerous but include: Unisys, Oracle and Microsoft. Trademark personnel have to launch a multitude of separate applications to perform their tasks. Information sometimes needs to be copied and pasted between applications. Some work products have to be saved to the desktop for later use. Most applications are run on individual`s computers rather than on centralized servers. The graphical interfaces themselves lack a modern look and feel. The Trademark system is a collection of applications that collectively consists of millions of lines of source code, more than one thousand data elements, and hundreds of reports. Virtual workflow has been implemented through mainframe programs and custom user interfaces. A highly simplified logical overview of the organization of the existing systems appears on the following page. As shown in this overview, Trademark processing relies heavily upon three main systems capabilities: searching, status and bibliographic data, and digital records. There are three internal and three external primary systems: TRAM, TICRS, XSearch; and TARR, TDR, TESS. These systems are supported by a several others, including the Madrid Processing system for managing international Trademark applications and registrations.

FAST

The ultimate goal of this project is to make the user`s experience as integrated and intuitive as possible under various USPTO in support of Trademarks/Patents. The stakeholders desire a simple and unified interface that: does not require launching of separate applications in separate windows; support new IT advances; and allows for greater flexibility in communication with all stakeholders. The design must balance technical and visual functionality in order to create system interfaces that are: operational, fast, integrated, reliable, and adaptable to user needs and changing agency infrastructure. Much of the task analysis phase has been completed, however more assistance and support is needed to move to the design. This purpose of the 1st Task under the contract is to provide an integrated, fast, and reliable user centered design interface for Trademark`s system(s). This solution will provide Trademark with a flexible interface that easily implements statutory requirements and enhances existing workflow processes to meet stakeholder expectations. 1.2 Context of Use 1.2.1 Key Internal Stakeholders Trademark attorneys and support staff review the cases in their docket to take action to make decisions about the registerability of submitted applications based on a specific event during the examination process. Each business unit has supervisors and managers who provide oversight to employees and require statistical reporting. 2

It also contains metadata such as the date of filing, the applicant`s names, the application number, and so on. REGISTRATION PROCESS A trademark application is an incoming document filed by an applicant that consists of applicant information, mark information, additional statements, goods and/or services information, filing basis, correspondence information, and a signature. Each application is assigned a filing date, a serial number, and the class(es) of goods and/or services (if none was provided by the applicant.) A filing fee based on the number of classes is required but a minimum of one filing fee must be paid to receive a filing date. Applications are reviewed and notated with design codes and a pseudo mark (as appropriate) to assisting in searching the mark during the examination process. Such notations are administrative and not a determination or limitation on applicant`s rights. Applications also contain metadata that is collected from the information provided. A trademark application is submitted by an applicant. An applicant can be a corporate entity, an individual person, joint applicants, or any other legal entity. An applicant may or may not be represented by an attorney. Applications can be filed electronically or on paper through the mail or hand delivered to the USPTO. The vast majority of new applications are filed electronically. An application may include only one mark. The mark can be either a standard character mark (typed drawing) or a special form mark which includes stylized word(s), a design or a design with words. If the mark includes a design or is stylized, the applicant must submit a separate image of the mark known as the Drawing. A standard character mark may simpl y be typed into the application without a separate attachment. The initial application is processed through the pre-examination unit and checked for minimum requirements. If the minimum requirements are met, the applicant receives a filing date and is issued a filing receipt. If the application does not meet the minimum requirements, it is returned to the applicant along with all fees paid and the serial number is misassigned.

10/13/2011 11:55:14 PM Draft Statement of Work (SOW) For User Interface Designs for The United States Patent and Trademark Office DOC52PAPT1200002 Approximately three months from the filing date, the application is assigned to an examining attorney for a legal review. During this period awaiting examination, the applicant may submit preliminary amendments to the application. These preliminary amendments may be filed electronically or on paper. Such amendments remain in the file as proposed until an examining attorney is assigned to review the application. However, some information in the amendment may result in the file record being updated. Applications are examined in the order received except if they are granted special status by petitioning the Director or meet certain co-pending (companion file) requirements. The typical workflow for an examining attorney working with a new application is:    Review the application data for compliance with various legal and procedural requirements Annotate the application record with notes, as appropriate Formulate a search strategy and conduct a search of the USPTO`s database of marks to see if there are any possible conflicting marks already registered or the subject of applications with an earlier filing date. Search the internet including specialized databases for information and evidence that may serve as a basis for refusing registration or for other relevant information to understand the meaning of the mark, the nature of the goods, etc. Consult reference materials including the USPTO`s Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure, court rulings/decisions and other training materials. Decide whether or not the application must be refused registration or approved for publication.



 

If registration is refused, the examining attorney writes an Office Action that informs the applicant of the reasons the application is being refused and provides the applicant six (6) months to submit a response. The Office action may attach relevant evidence in support of the decision. The Office action is issued electronically if the applicant has authorized e-mail communications. Otherwise, it is mailed through the USPS. If the application is approved for publication, it is then forwarded for proofing by Legal Instrument Examiners prior to receiving a publication date. The applicant is issued a notice of publication. Despite the linear description above, examination is an iterative process. In some cases the examining attorney will interact with the applicant directly or discuss the case with their manager, senior attorney or peer. In some cases, interaction with quality review or ID/Class staff attorneys may be necessary. Generally, the examining attorney must reach a decision and take action within seven (7) days of initial assignment of the application to the attorney. The applicant can respond to the office action at any time within the six (6) month response period with arguments, corrections, and amendments. The response may be submitted electronically or on paper. The information provided in the response may be auto-uploaded or entered by the support units before being sent to the examining attorney in the amended case docket. If the applicant fails to respond, the examining attorney will hold the application abandoned and a notice of abandonment is issued to the applicant. The applicant may file a petition to revive an application abandoned for failure to respond to an Office action within certain deadlines upon payment of the petition fee. Petitions may be filed electronically or on paper. Based on the information provided in the response, the examining attorney will again decide whether to approve the application for publication or continue to refuse registration. If the examining attorney continues the refusal(s) or other requirement(s), another Office action, generally a final Office action will be issued with a new six (6) month response period.

4

10/13/2011 11:55:14 PM Draft Statement of Work (SOW) For User Interface Designs for The United States Patent and Trademark Office DOC52PAPT1200002 The applicant may request reconsideration and/or file a Notice of Appeal with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. At any point in examination, the examining attorney may also decide that action on a file should be suspended. This can happen during initial exam or after receipt of a response from the applicant. After a final Office action has issued, and if no appeal has been filed, the examining attorney may abandon the file for applicant`s failure to respond or for an incomplete response if the reason(s) for refusing registration are not resolved. An applicant may petition to revive an application if no response was filed. If a response was filed and found not acceptable, the applicant may petition the Director to review the examining attorney`s decision to abandon for an incomplete response. If an appeal has been filed, the appeal must be resolved by the TTAB. Appeal briefs are filed by both the applicant and the examining attorney in accordance with the time periods set by the TTAB. If the examining attorney decides to approve the mark for publication, it enters the publication cycle and the applicant is provided a notice of publication. (However, if an application is allowed for registration on the Supplemental Register, it does not publish for opposition but instead moves directly forward to registration.) Any third party, who believes they may be harmed by registration of the mark, may file a notice of Opposition with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board within 30 days from the publication date. Third parties may also file letters of protest which are not made public and are decided in the petitions unit. If no opposition is filed, the application proceeds to registration if the filing basis is use in commerce and/or based on a foreign registration (44e application). A paper registration certificate is mailed to the applicant. It is possible during the period after publication and before registration for an applicant to file an amendment to the application or a petition to the Director. This may result in jurisdiction being restored to the examining attorney and possible republication of the application. If no opposition is filed and the application was based on intent to use the mark in commerce, a notice of allowance is issued. The notice of allowance provides six months for the applicant to respond. If the applicant is not ready to submit a statement of use within six months, it may file a request for extension of time. The applicant may file up to 5 extensions of time to file a statement of use. These are due every six months. After issuance of the notice of allowance, the applicant must file a statement of use before a registration certificate will be issued. The statement of use is reviewed by the intent-to-use unit for minimum requirements. If minimum requirements are met, it is forwarded to the original examining attorney to examine. The same examination process then occurs as above. This is often referred to as second exam. If there are no issues raised by the statement of use, instead of approving the mark for publication, the mark is allowed for registration and a paper registration certificate is mailed to the applicant. Failure to file a statement of use or extension request within the deadlines provided by federal law will result in the application being abandoned. The applicant may file a petition to revive the application within certain deadlines upon payment of the petition fee. A petition to revive will not be granted if it is beyond the 36 months from the date the original notice of allowance was issued and no statement of use was filed during that 36 month period. There are a number of different work units in Trademarks including the pre-exam unit, the law offices, the examination support unit, the intent to use unit, and the petitions unit that work on applications during different stages of the process. 5

10/13/2011 11:55:14 PM Draft Statement of Work (SOW) For User Interface Designs for The United States Patent and Trademark Office DOC52PAPT1200002 POST REGISTRATION PROCESS The Post Registration process begins after a Trademark is registered by the USPTO. A registration may be based on use in commerce, a valid foreign registration, or an extension of protection of an International Registration. Currently, the USPTO issues registrations on the Principal Register or the Supplemental Register. The owner of the registration must file an affidavit of use or excusable non-use between the fifth and sixth year after registration (or during the six (6) month grace period immediately following) or the registration is cancelled. The owner of the registration must also file an acceptable affidavit of use or excusable nonuse under and application for renewal during the one year before the end of every ten-year registration period (or during the six (6) month grace period immediately following). Failure to file these documents will result in cancellation of the registration. An applicant may not petition to revive a cancelled registration for failure to file the proper maintenance documents. Owners of marks on the Principal Register can also make a claim of incontestability under §15 of the Trademark Act. In doing so, the owner claims the exclusive right to use a registered mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services covered by the Trademark Registration. A claim of incontestability can only be made after the mark has been in continuous use in commerce for a period of five consecutive years after the date of registration. The affidavit of incontestability is often filed with the affidavit of use. The Post Registration Division examines these filings for completeness and compliance with statutory requirements. Through the acceptance and/or acknowledgement of these filings, an owner`s rights to a mark are maintained. If the documents are incomplete or do not meet the statutory requirements, the owner of the registration is notified and provided six (6) months to respond. Petitions to the Director are often filed concerning post registration matters. The owner can also request that the Post Registration Division correct or amend a Trademark Registration by filing requests. Request to amend a registration or correct registrant`s mistake require the payment of a fee. Corrections requested to resolve clerical errors that occurred through the fault of the USPTO do not require the payment of a fee. Amendments are requested to reflect changes that occurred after registration, e.g., updates to the mark, surrender of goods or services, division of ownership with respect to some, but not all, of the goods or services, or changes in ownership with respect to all of the goods or services. If the amendment or correction is accepted, the mark is published in the Official Gazette and an updated registration is issued. 1.3 Analysis: Recent and Ongoing User Research

Extensive user research has been gathered for each of the various work processes. Over the last few months, user research focus sessions have been conducted across the organization until convergence was reached. The information received has been incorporated into the statement of work. In addition to the research sessions a series of mailboxes were setup to solicit and collect feedback from internal and external stakeholders. This feedback was compiled and translated into individual capabilities statements to be defined into requirements. These desired features should be considered for integration into the next generation system. Previous studies conducted included observations and timed studies of current office actions for each of the business units which can be utilized as well. Other relevant documents are also available that describe vision, design and features for Trademark systems. In addition to the above, Trademarks recently assembled a business architecture group to document the As Is and begin developing a To Be business architecture. All of this information will be used to enhance and refine the requirements created for the current systems; thus allowing trademarks to continue to automate and enhance the existing workflow under a single unified interface. 6

10/13/2011 11:55:14 PM Draft Statement of Work (SOW) For User Interface Designs for The United States Patent and Trademark Office DOC52PAPT1200002 Functionality for New User Interface(s) 4.3.1 Introduction

Trademark examination is an information-rich, and in most cases, text-rich enterprise. A new user interface must be able to present this information in a clear, uncluttered, scalable manner. User research conducted so far has revealed a need for improved functionality that is not supported in the current system(s). In many cases, multiple trademark staff review or handle the same case at various points in the process for a variety of reasons as it moves through the application or renewal process. For this reason, there is much advantage to be gained by supplying trademarks with interfaces that allow for storing and sharing of information. The design challenge is to develop interface(s) and tools that can help users manage and use this information in a timely manner without creating information overload. Additionally, many of the trademark staff work from home or some other remote locations, and this number is expected to continue to increase. Changes in the underlying architecture must facilitate this goal and not impact performance of system, but the interface(s) as well must be designed with this need in mind, allowing examination to take place on different screen sizes, optimizing for offline work and for communication with co-workers who are remotely located. The functionality below shall be included in the new design, subject to results of usability testing. This is not an exhaustive list of required functionality, and more may be revealed by additional user research. 4.3.2 Viewing and Manipulating Trademark Applications Trademark applications are highly structured documents with many parts including accompanying documentation and prosecution history for cases. The trademark staff needs to be able to view and navigate portions of the application in an easy way and see associated marks, descriptions of goods and services, etc. and so on. Viewing of the application or request for service must be tightly integrated with writing office actions, performing searches, editing data and seeing the status information. It is crucial that the system be able to incorporate and attach various types of multimedia as part of case files or office actions. These documents are often large and should allow for the user to identify specific sections for review or collaboration. 4.3.3 Writing Office Actions The office action writing tool should create structured documents as well as allow the user to make free-form textual entries or modifications. Currently office actions are typically put together by selecting and modifying previously written text. This text should be ready-at-hand for use in the office action. Some pre-defined text comes from user reference materials (such as the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedures) and is often reused; this also should be ready-at-hand for the current office action. The current system utilizes a repository of Form Paragraphs using a tree-like interface for selecting supporting paragraphs. This tool encompasses standardized paragraphs utilizing specific templates with data points automatically inserted throughout the text (for instance office action mail date, serial or registration number, addresses, etc.). While this is semi-automated, the ability of the stakeholder to select the form paragraphs, the updates to the paragraphs or modifications to the templates are still difficult and sometimes require a build of the application for simple changes. Office actions require the ability to easily include a variety of attachments such as internet evidence, reference materials, court decisions, previous office actions and various forms of multimedia and the organization and management of the attachments. 11

10/13/2011 11:55:14 PM Draft Statement of Work (SOW) For User Interface Designs for The United States Patent and Trademark Office DOC52PAPT1200002 4.3.4 Comparing Text and Various Multimedia In many circumstances, examiners need tools to compare as well as accept various types of text and formats. For instance, this includes comparing the text, mark and specimens in an amended application to the original. Several different interface(s) for comparing texts should be experimented with; since it may be necessarily to support more than one. 4.3.5 Collaboration and Docket Management, including Alerts Management of individual cases and their entire docket should be seamlessly integrated with the tool(s) for writing office actions, performing searches, viewing specimens and importing various multi-media type files as well as allowing for alerts for upcoming/approaching statutory timeframes. Trademarks staff also need to be able to adjust the prioritization of goals and see the impact of adjusting prioritization on their work productivity counts, in real time. Methods of communicate and collaborate with members of the organization is important in the examination process. Typically this communication is a request via email, phone or fax for the review of an office action or finding or request for an action to occur. The communication for these should be integrated with the rest of the tools. The results should appear affixed to the appropriate case(s). Specific types of communication should be viewable only by identified roles. Trademark staff should be able to share workspaces with one another when desired; pairs or groups should be able to share and work on cases together if desired. When Trademark staff completes an office action, the manager or another staff person may look over the work and annotate the document with corrections or desired changes. The staff person then must make the requested corrections or continue the discussion with their peer/supervisor. This can take several rounds of conversation and may involve searching for or referring to additional case documentation. 4.3.6 Search System Most examiners currently make heavy use of a command-language search tool whose outstanding feature is the ability to combine search statements with numerical indicators. The search strategy surrounds reducing the set of documents retrieved to a reasonable number, rather than looking at top hits. A query is run and a result is shown in terms of the number of documents retrieved. A new query is then run, often incorporating the line number of the previous query. After a reasonably sized results list is found, examiners then review the trademarks. X-Search is the primary search tool project used for Trademark searching and is divided into two major parts, namely the Server (including the search engine and the creation and maintenance of the search database); and the customized GUI. The X-Search System supports Trademark Examination attorneys in searching for existing trademarks prior to granting new registrations. The program consists of four main windows (or panes): an image display pane, a full text display pane, a search pane and a hit list pane. The hit list pane includes six different tabs for various manipulations of the records retrieved by a search. Further pull-down menus and push-button tabs present the program`s search; view/compare, cut and paste, print and save options.

12

10/13/2011 11:55:14 PM Draft Statement of Work (SOW) For User Interface Designs for The United States Patent and Trademark Office DOC52PAPT1200002 The current automated Trademark Search System (X-Search 1.1, version 1.16) contains data on both live and dead trademark applications and registrations. This Automated Information System (AIS) is used by Trademark Examining attorneys at the USPTO as the basis for determining the ability to register new trademark applications. X-Search permits sophisticated searches against the Trademark database to identify marks that may be confusingly similar. Both textual and image data are displayed for marks that meet the search criteria. X-Search is also used by members of the general public from within the Trademark Search Library (TMSL), Universal Public Workstation System (UPWS). Generally, the public relies on the X-Search system in the development of new marks, prior to filing for application. While X-Search is the internal search tool, the external stakeholders utilize Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) from outside the firewall. As the interface to the various applications is being integrated, the search system user interface should be included in this analysis. As mentioned the search tools should be integrated with information about prior searches, documents that have been used by the Trademark staff themselves, other people working on similar trademark applications, related office actions, and so on. Trademark staff should be able to search case documents and cite in the current document information to search including mark, owner, etc. The interface should be able to accommodate the additions of optional advanced search interface tools, such as sense-making tools and information visualization tools. It should be possible to seamlessly move between such tools, with queries and retrieved documents retained as sets between views. 4.3.7 Editing and Sharing Structured Content One set of desired new features centers around selecting and using pieces of structured content, editing documents using structured content, for automatically filling in metadata where appropriate and for providing automated checks against information being entered for error reduction such as bibliographic data. The new interface should be able to seamlessly integrate results of such automated processing. One of the primary pieces of structured content that would require a new interface would be the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure, Acceptable Identification of Goods and Services Manual, Official Gazette, Trademark Examination Guides and the Design Search Code Manual. 4.3.8 Bookmarks, Highlights and Tags Bookmarks should be affixable to all information items within the system. This includes search queries, lists, search results, applications, drawings, specimens, marks, office actions and other document artifacts. Tags should be shareable, navigable, and searchable. It should be possible to create groups of tags for analysis for elevating to a shared status for future classification efforts. While drawings and other images should not be editable, users should be able to add comments, search and copy and paste. Sharing of this information should be possible across units and ad hoc groups such as any stakeholder working on a trademark. Another type of required functionality should allow the Trademarks staff to communicate about modifications, decisions, quality reviews, etc. with supervisors, peers, etc. This communication needs to take place but with specific permissions or layers so that the certain communications and or discussions do not become part of the official record for that case. 13

10/13/2011 11:55:14 PM Draft Statement of Work (SOW) For User Interface Designs for The United States Patent and Trademark Office DOC52PAPT1200002 As users currently use a wide range of ad hoc methods to support this kind of communication, it may be necessary to provide more than one interface solution for this need. One innovative idea that has received positive user response is the ability to leave voice messages affixed to specific parts of documents rather than typing email messages. The ability to use audio for annotations and other functions (in addition to keyboard command) should be considered and possibly designed into the new interface. 4.3.9 Searching Across Information Ad hoc groups of documents should be formable, and available for sharing and searching. They should have a facility to assign names, key words and tags and to be organized in well-defined places. Saved documents should include sections of manuals, office actions, decisions, etc. Saved documents should be able to be associated with particular cases or in a globally accessible store. All documents associated with a case should be automatically recorded, viewable, and searchable as such. It should be easy to quickly open or hide all documents associated with a case. These should be automatically recorded with the ability for pruning or boosting in importance. A user should be able to see searches conducted by other people that are relevant to the current case. They should also be able to see prior documents that are frequently used among this group, optionally for particular query terms. They should also be able to see lists and pre-canned queries. The definition of who these groups of people are should be controllable to particular individuals, units, and ad hoc groups. These views should be sharable. However, individuals should be able to control which items are not sharable in an easy and obvious manner. A user should be able to view previous searches, documents, and other artifacts associated with the office actions for a particular trademark application. Users should be able to search the text/annotations for earlier office actions, as well as filter by person, group, owner, etc. connected to the application or case. The user should be able to search manuals such as the TMEP (Trademark Manual of Examination Procedures), for statutes and court decisions, and annotations on these documents. Trademark staff should also be able to search and display data from various sources that are linked by unique identifiers such as Serial Number, Registration Number, International Registration Number and FASTER Quality Insignias. 4.3.10 Notifications and Alerts User research reveals a need for a simple yet effective alerting and notification system for helping Trademark stakeholders be aware what deadlines are coming. Timely, relevant alerts are a key user goal for the system, as is the desire for a centralized location for such communication. 4.3.11 Management Dashboards and Other Methods for Managing Workload and Creating Production Statistics The various Trademark supervisors and managers monitor numerous cases per day for each business unit. The supervisors currently have the ability to review, categorize and prioritize types of work in order to maintain adequate pendency levels. Trademark management and supervisors must balance a rich and complex workload, distributing cases among the examining attorneys, support, and quality staff. There is a desire to move away from email-based communication between the units to a tool that allows for ordering/organizing tasks that provides for a complete management oversight dashboard across business units. Other tools/reporting methods are needed for report generation and data analysis of trademark statistics to enable prediction of trends, assist with production statistics, hiring and training needs. 14

10/13/2011 11:55:14 PM Draft Statement of Work (SOW) For User Interface Designs for The United States Patent and Trademark Office DOC52PAPT1200002 The user interface should be capable of providing a real-time view into the current state of any business unit in the organization. 5.0 CONTRACT TYPE

(End of clause) PTO-10 Agency-Level Protest Procedures (DEC 1996) a. PURPOSE: To implement the requirements of Executive Order No. 12979 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 33.103). On October 25, 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order No. 12979, which directs heads of executive agencies to develop administrative procedures for resolving protests to awards of procurement contracts within their agencies at a level above the Contracting Officer. Authority to administer procurementrelated directives has been delegated within the Department of Commerce through the Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary for Administration to the Director for Acquisition Management (Procurement Executive). The Department's goal is to encourage protesters to resolve their protests at the agency level, help build confidence in the Government's acquisition system, and reduce protests to the General Accounting Office and other external forces. Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties shall use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party at the Contracting Officer level through open and frank discussions. If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency at a level above the Contracting Officer. b. DEFINITIONS: An agency protest is one that may be filed with either the contracting officer or the protest decision authority but not both. When a protester decides to file a protest at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the guidelines set forth in these established agency level protest procedures above the contracting officer apply. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 33.102. A day is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of the Department of Commerce are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Department is open. 24

10/13/2011 11:55:14 PM Draft Statement of Work (SOW) For User Interface Designs for The United States Patent and Trademark Office DOC52PAPT1200002 c. PROCEDURES: i. Protesters using these procedures may protest to the protest decision authority who will make the final decision for the Department. Protests shall be addressed to: Chief Financial Officer U.S. Patent & Trademark Office P.O. Box 1450 Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency-level Protest". The protester shall also provide a copy of the protest within 1 day to the responsible contracting officer and a copy to the addressee indicated below: Office of the General Counsel General Law Office U.S. Patent & Trademark Office P.O. Box 1450 Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 (FAX Number 571-273-0099) ii. Election of forum: While a protest is pending at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the protester agrees not to protest to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or any other external forums. If the protester has already filed with the GAO or other external forums, the procedures described here may not be used. Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or time set for receipt of proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals. If the contract has been awarded, protests must be filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after the date the protester was given the opportunity to be debriefed, whichever date is later. In cases other than those covered in the preceding two sentences, protests shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier. b. To be filed on a given day, protests must be received by 4:30 PM current local time. Amy protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day. Incomplete submissions will not be considered filed until all information is provided. c. To be complete, protests must contain the following information: 1. the protester's name, address, telephone number, and fax number 2. the solicitation or contract number, name of contracting office and the contracting officer 3. a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, and an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced 4. copies of relevant documents supporting protester's statement 5. a request for ruling by the agency 6. Statement as to form of relief requested 7. all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protest 8. all information establishing the timeliness of the protest 9. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. Within 14 days after the protest is filed, the Contracting Officer will prepare an administrative report that responds to the issues raised by the protester and addresses any other issues, which, even if not raised by the 25

For good cause shown, the protest decision authority may grant an extension of time for filing the administrative report and for issuing the written decision. When an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will notify the protester and all interested parties within I day of the decision to grant the extension. Unless an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will issue a decision within 35 days of the protest. The protest decision authority's final decision will be binding on the Department of Commerce and not subject to further appeals. The protest decision authority shall send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by certified mail, return receipt requested with information copies to the applicable contracting office and Office of Acquisition Management. iii. Effect of protest on award and performance: When a protest is filed prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) based on a written finding that: a. The supplies or services are urgently required, b. delivery or performance would be unduly delayed by failure to make the award promptly, or c. a prompt award will be in the best interest of the Government. When a protest is filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after a debriefing date was offered to the protester under a timely debriefing request in accordance with FAR 15.506, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer shall immediately suspend performance pending the resolution of the protest within the agency, including any review by an independent higher official, unless continued performance is justified. The HCA may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, based on a written finding that: 1. contract performance would be in the best interest of the United States, or 2. urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision. d. REMEDIES: The protest decision authority may grant one or more of the following remedies: i. terminate the contract, ii. re -compete the requirement, iii. issue a new solicitation, iv. refrain from exercising options under the contract, v. award a contract consistent with statutes and regulations, vi. amend the solicitation provisions which gave rise to the protest and continue with the procurement, vii. such other remedies as the decision-maker may determine are necessary to correct a defect.
