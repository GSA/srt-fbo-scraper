A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full

Page 12

payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

This definition includes the following categories of information: (1) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 29) as amended, the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager or his/her designee); (2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, "Policies and Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of SSI," as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or his/her designee); (3) Information designated as "For Official Use Only," which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and (4) Any information that is designated "sensitive" or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures.

Upon the Contracting Officer's request, the Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted, or subject to other investigations as required. All contractor employees requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information or IT resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures. (d) The Contracting Officer may require the contractor to prohibit individuals from working on the contract if the government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to, carelessness, insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns. (e) Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information. Therefore, the Contractor shall not disclose, orally or in writing, any sensitive information to any person unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer.

In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate actions with regard to the contract and the individual(s) involved.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

Page 22

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan deemed in certain cases.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.108-7001 through 3009.108-7003; __ it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.108-7001 through 3009.108-7003, but it has submitted a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.108-7004, which has not been denied; or __ it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.108-7001 through 3009.108-7003, but it plans to submit a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.108-7004.

In presenting material in your response, you are advised that quality of information is more important than quantity. Clarity, brevity, and logical organization should be emphasized in preparing your response.

2. VOLUME 1, SECTION 1 - TECHNICAL APPROACH Fulfillment of the Statement of Work (SOW) Requirements: The Technical Approach shall specifically and in detail describe the Offeror's proposed technical approach. It shall allow the Government to make a complete evaluation of the proposed solution(s) for satisfying all of the requirements but may propose solution(s) that exceed the requirements. Offerors will need to assess for themselves their internal price/technical trade-off: while the Government welcomes novel technical approaches, Offerors need not propose solutions that far exceed the requirements at a significant price premium to the Government. The Technical Approach must not contain any cost information. The Technical Approach must include any descriptive literature, written narrative, or supplemental data necessary to show compliance with the SOW's minimum requirements to include delivery and warranty terms. 3. VOLUME 1, SECTION 2 Â­ PAST PERFORMANCE The Offeror shall provide no fewer than three (3) but no more than five (5) examples of Past Performance information for active or complete "relevant/recent" contracts/task orders and/or subcontracts directly related to the technical requirements described in the SOW.

The Offeror shall provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the examples of Past Performance to the requirements of the solicitation. Past Performance information is comprised of two elements: a. A brief narrative statement on each relevant Past Performance example that demonstrates a favorable experience for the customer and how it is an indication of expected quality technical work to meet the requirements of the SOW. The example shall include a summary of the Offeror's Past Performance regarding meeting technical, schedule requirements, and a description of the internal Page 31

HSSS01-13-R-0052 (FBO Combined Synopsis/Solicitation) controls that ensured Offeror did not exceed the contract cost/price performed during previous relevant efforts. Each Past Performance example cited shall include the following information: i. Contractor's Name/CAGE Code/ DUNS # and Place of Performance ii. Title of contract and award date iii. Name and address of Contracting Activity/Agency iv. Contracting Activity Point of Contact, including name, telephone number, and email address v. Description of product and/or service vi.

The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided as an attachment to this solicitation for your reference only--so that you may see what questions will be asked of your Past Performance references. Offerors are not to follow-up with persons providing Past Performance information. The Government will contact Offeror's references to ensure that they have been afforded reasonable opportunity to submit a completed questionnaire. Other related Past Performance information may be sought and used for evaluating completeness and accuracy of the Offeror's proposals; the Government reserves the right to contact end-users identified through the Past Performance Questionnaire and to solicit further information about performance in regard to quality, timeliness, and cost. The accuracy of Past Performance data, including phone numbers of the points of contact are the responsibility of the Offeror and inaccuracy may result in non-consideration of the reference. Past Performance information may be obtained from a variety of sources including other governmental agencies and the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). 4. VOLUME 1, SECTION 3 - EXCEPTIONS, AND DEVIATIONS All exceptions, deviations, and waivers must be addressed in Section 3. If no deviations exist, a one page statement may be placed in this section and referenced in the Executive Summary. This section must contain a certification that it contains all exceptions and deviations that the Offeror takes from the provisions to the solicitation and its applicable documents. An exception is where an Offeror states it will not comply with a requirement, usually involving contract terms and conditions. A deviation is where an Offeror states it will not comply with a requirement but proposes an alternative to meet the intent of the requirement, usually involving a specification. Exceptions and deviations may cause proposals to be considered unresponsive. A mere assumption or condition shall not be considered an exception or deviation as defined herein. Offerors shall provide a detailed description of each exception or deviation; specifically identify the portion of the solicitation and the proposal Page 32

HSSS01-13-R-0052 (FBO Combined Synopsis/Solicitation) that are affected; indicate the difficulty with the applicable requirement as stated by the Government; and, provide a proposed solution. 5.

The information required in these price instructions applies to both the Offeror and all principal subcontractors. Offerors are responsible for submitting sufficient information to enable the Government personnel to fully evaluate their price proposal as stated in Evaluation Criteria. The pricing approach of all proposals should include sufficient detail to ensure the estimates are complete and reasonable. Your proposal is presumed to represent your best efforts to respond to the solicitation. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance and price should be explained in the proposal. Assumptions An explanation of all assumptions that affect the price estimates shall be provided. Topics to be addressed include, but are not limited to, investments, cost/price sharing, and programmatic variables (e.g., inflation/escalation, location, make/buy/lease decisions, prime/subcontractor relationships, and business base concerns). Contract Price For each contract line item number (CLIN), provide firm-fixed pricing. Identify additional/reduced prices, if any, that would be incurred in the performance of this effort that have not been identified in the solicitation. Proposed Government Furnished Equipment or Facilities The Government will NOT furnish equipment or facilities. SECTION III: EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD Award will be based on a best value/trade off evaluation, price and other factors considered, in order to award a firm-fixed price order to the Offeror presenting, in the judgment of the Government, the most advantageous offer to the Government. The order award will be based upon an integrated assessment of each Offeror's ability to satisfy the solicitation requirements. The Government anticipates awarding on initial offers but reserves the right to conduct discussions with Offerors if necessary, hence, the Government reserves the right to make award without discussions. The Government will make award to that responsible Offeror's proposal, conforming to the solicitation that is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Offerors are advised that a proposal meeting the solicitation requirements with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher priced Offeror is determined to be more advantageous to the Government. Best value evaluation is, in and of itself, a subjective assessment by the Government of the proposed solutions in order to acquire the most advantageous result for the Government, price and other factors considered. Page 33

HSSS01-13-R-0052 (FBO Combined Synopsis/Solicitation) Subjectivity is inherent in the process. The evaluation factors represent key areas of importance to be considered in the selection decision. The evaluation factors will be used to support meaningful comparison and discrimination between and among competing Offerors' responses. All evaluations factors other than price, i.e. Technical Approach (to include any Exceptions/Deviations) and Past Performance, are approximately equal in importance to price. Technical Approach is more important than Past Performance. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-5 Evaluation of Options. (JUL 1990). A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL APPROACH The Offeror's technical approach will be reviewed to determine if it is consistent with the price proposal and reflects a clear understanding of the scope of work necessary to meet the solicitation requirements. For the Technical Approach factor, a proposal rating will be assigned. The proposal rating will be informed by the Government's assessment of whether the proposal meets the solicitation's technical requirements; an offer will be rated one of the following: Outstanding, Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Marginal, or Unsatisfactory. An offer must meet the Minimum Requirements of the SOW (2.2.4); the Government will assess as proposal strengths, in the area of Technical Approach, those offers that provide the beneficial, additional features in 2.2.5. Exceptions and Deviations from this solicitation are not required. Offeror's may submit a statement that no exceptions or deviations are proposed. However, Offerors must substantiate any exception or deviation from the requirements of this solicitation to the best of their ability. Any exceptions/deviations will be evaluated under the Technical Approach factor.

FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE The Past Performance factor is defined by the relevant experience the Offeror has gained under specific contracts within the three-years immediately preceding the date of this solicitation. The Past Performance factor enables the assessment of how well the Offeror has performed, subjectively evaluated, during the course of a contract. The Past Performance evaluation will consider the extent to which the Offeror's Past Performance demonstrates its capability and capacity to deliver high quality service and solutions to meet the requirements of this SOW. The evaluation will consider the extent to which the Offeror has demonstrated the relevant Past Performance in performing work of the same or similar complexity and scope as that described in the SOW. The following areas will be considered in the evaluation: 1) Relevance; 2) Meeting technical requirements; 3) Page 34

HSSS01-13-R-0052 (FBO Combined Synopsis/Solicitation) Meeting schedule requirements; 4) Controlling contract costs; and 5) Managing the contracted effort. The Government will evaluate the quality of the Offeror's performance of similar work as described in the SOW. Where relevant performance records indicate performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness. It is incumbent upon the Offeror to explain the relevance of the data provided and substantiate that improvements from Past Performance problems are being made. The burden of providing thorough and complete Past Performance information rests with the Offeror. Problems not addressed by the Offeror will be considered to still exist. However, consideration for discounting problems may be given when those problems are addressed through demonstrated systemic improvement. FACTOR 3: PRICE In evaluating the Price Volume, the Government will evaluate the Price Volume to determine price reasonableness and will review consistency with the Offeror's technical approach. Each Offeror shall demonstrate a clear understanding of the solicitation requirements as evidenced in the total evaluated price. The total evaluated price will be the sum of the evaluated price for all CLINs, including option CLINs. The Government reserves the right to request additional data as needed to clarify offeror's pricing methodologies/support proposal price analysis. The Government may determine that an offer is unresponsive if the price(s) proposed are unbalanced between the line items or sub-line items. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options. No advantage will accrue to an Offeror who submits an unrealistically low-priced proposal. Such a proposal may be viewed as indicative of a lack of understanding of the desired objective of the Government. Reasonableness of price shall be assessed by performing comparative price analysis (e.g. comparing the prices received from multiple Offerors). The Government may utilize additional information to determine price reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. In no case can the Government justify a price that exceeds the commercial prices available for similar supplies and services. For evaluation purposes, adjustments the Government deems appropriate may be made to include Government costs required to accomplish the Offeror's proposed approach, with the exception of those costs to the Government determines are equal across all Offerors. As part of the cost/price evaluation, the Government may consider DCAA audit information and other information the Government deems relevant. SECTION IV: A. AWARD ON INITIAL OFFERS:

FAR 15.209 permits contract award on the basis of initial offers without written or oral discussions. NOTE: Oral discussions are distinct from oral presentations. Oral presentations will not occur. The winning proposal must have no deficiencies or significant exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. B. IDENTIFICATION OF PROPOSAL DEFICIENCIES AND/OR AREAS NEEDING CLARIFICATION/SUBSTANTIATION:

Clarifications may take place even when award on initial offers is contemplated. Clarifications are limited exchanges, between the Government and Offerors that may occur when award without discussions is Page 35

HSSS01-13-R-0052 (FBO Combined Synopsis/Solicitation) contemplated. If award will be made without conducting discussions, Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals (e.g., the relevance of an Offeror's Past Performance information and adverse Past Performance information to which the Offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors. Clarifications may never result in a revised proposal (however, this does not mean they will not be documented, just that they may never give rise to a change in the Offeror's proposed approach to satisfying Government requirements). Those areas requiring technical discussions with the Offeror will be identified and documented by the Government for use in written/oral discussions. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. C. COMMUNICATIONS WITH OFFERORS BEFORE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMPETITIVE RANGE:

Communications are exchanges, between the Government and Offerors after receipt of proposals, leading to the establishment of the competitive range. If a competitive range is to be established, communications are limited to circumstances where a) Past Performance information is the determining factor preventing an Offeror from being placed in the competitive range and shall be limited to adverse Past Performance to which an Offeror has not had an opportunity to respond; and b) communications may only be held with those Offerors whose inclusion in or exclusion from the competitive range is uncertain. D. DETERMINATION OF THE COMPETITIVE RANGE:

When award on initial offers is not possible, the Government will determine the competitive range following an evaluation of the cost/price and technical proposals. The competitive range shall be comprised of all the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency pursuant to FAR15.306(c)(2). Offerors whose proposals are determined to be outside the competitive range will be notified following the procedures of FAR 15.503. If it is determined that a proposal should no longer be included in the competitive range, the proposal shall be eliminated from consideration for award (FAR 15.306(c)(3)). Discussions with other Offerors need not have been completed.
