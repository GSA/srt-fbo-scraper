In accordance with guidance from the Homeland Security Council, all federal agencies have been developing plans for keeping our government workforce operational during a pandemic influenza or other emergency periods. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) has provided a directive relative to preparation for an influenza pandemic and includes engineering controls (e.g. sneeze guards, negative pressure rooms), administrative controls (e.g. teleconferencing), work practices (e.g. tissues, no-touch trash cans, hand soap, etc.) and personal protective equipment (e.g.masks or respirators). This directive can be identified by the name: OSHA 3327-02N 2007. The document can be found in its entirety on the internet at: http://www.osha.gov/Publications/influenza_pandemic.html. During a Pandemic or other emergency, the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) understands that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: $ $ Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency.

$ $

$ $ $

Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. With the employees, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness. Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.

$ $ $ $

It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the government contracting officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the AOC to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the AOC in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the AOC to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. The AOC does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other federal agencies, contract support from other existing AOC contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Normal Capitol Complex operations are, at irregular and unanticipated times, interrupted due to events that can occur on the Capitol Complex, e.g., funerals that utilize the Rotunda, closure of Congressional buildings due to unusual activities, etc. These can impact AOC contractor operations. Any AOC contractor that becomes aware of an event that may affect its operations on the Capitol Complex may go to www.aoc.gov/business/contractors/ to receive current information of the operational status of the Capitol Complex.

NOTICE
NO HAND CARRIED OFFERS! NO MAILED OFFERS!
Current security requirements established by the U.S. Capitol Police to screen mail being delivered to the U.S. Capitol Complex of buildings preclude the use of U.S. Postal Service by offerors to deliver offers submitted in response to this solicitation. In addition, because all packages must be screened for security purposes at a central location prior to their delivery, the Architect of the Capitol cannot accept packages containing offers handcarried directly to the Bid Room address within the Ford House Office Building, as specified elsewhere in this solicitation, or at any other location in the U.S. Capitol Complex of buildings. Due to these unusual circumstances the Procurement Division for the Architect of the Capitol will only accept offers via UPS or FEDEX. See provisions located in Section L for solicitations for services/supplies or the Solicitation Conditions for solicitations for construction. All handcarried offers will be rejected. Any attempt to handcarry an offer/proposal to any location in the U.S. Capitol Complex of buildings will be refused. Offerors are advised when sending offers via FEDEX or UPS not to use same day delivery. FEDEX/UPS often subcontract out the delivery for same-day service. It is necessary for delivery personnel to arrive in a FEDEX/UPS truck and be in a uniform recognized as FEDEX/UPS. Offerors are encouraged to determine who will be making the delivery when making arrangements with FEDEX/UPS.

STATEMENT OF WORK Web Design and Implementation

1.

Background and Project Description

1.1 Background The Architect of the Capitol is the creator and caretaker of the US Capitol complex and for more than 200 years has applied ingenuity and craftsmanship to serve Congress, preserve history, and sustain the home of American democracy. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible to the United States Congress for the maintenance, operation, development, and preservation of the Capitol, Congressional office buildings, Capitol Visitor Center, the Library of Congress buildings, the Supreme Court building, the U.S. Botanic Garden, the Capitol Power Plant, and other facilities. AOC.gov is comprised of approximately 600 pages and serves as the public face of the Agency for more than 3 million visitors to the site each year. Approximately 70% of the visitors are from the United States and 30% are from sites around the world. AOC.gov is also the top site within Google for high profile searches such as "Capitol" and "US Capitol." 1.2 Project Description This project seeks to transcend the typical, and reinvent AOC.gov, with an award-winning design, to become as visually stunning and as memorable as an in-person visit to the U.S. Capitol. This project will enhance the design of AOC.gov to be reflective of the stature and symbolism of the buildings of the Capitol and surrounding campus. The project will enhance the visitor experience for the wide-range of audiences accessing the site. Following an analysis and recommendation for design based on site metrics, audience profiles, and client goals, the selected vendor will develop web design templates for AOC.gov based on AOC brand standards that can be applied to the existing AOC.gov web content management system (PaperThin CommonSpot v.5). This design will include colors, fonts, layouts and navigation structure/information architecture for the AOC.gov home page and related sub-pages. The design shall support the mission of the AOC.gov site to inform and educate AOC stakeholders and the general public about the history, current operations and future plans for the Capitol Campus. An additional option within the project will be the application of the client-approved design templates across the AOC.gov site and assistance in search engine optimization/metadata to assist key audiences in accessing the content they are seeking.

1.3 Requirement The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is soliciting consulting and implementation services for web design that develop and deploy innovative, modern web design consistent with the mission and historic nature of the AOC. The design should be reflective of the stature and symbolism of the buildings of the Capitol and surrounding campus. The design will also require integration with other AOC web multimedia efforts currently underway. The AOC expects the Contractor to demonstrate its proven web design and analysis capabilities as well as to manage the planning, development, and implementation of all aspects of the effort effectively within the CommonSpot platform. The Contractor will have
RFP100042

Page 6 of 43

extensive experience and demonstrated skill in web design and deployment including meeting Section 508 compliance and in usability analysis. Similar experience with comparable visible and iconic institutions, organizations or companies is desired (examples: Museum of Modern Art (www.moma.org), Guggenheim (www.guggenheim.org/new-york), Museum of Science and Industry (www.msichicago.org), Otis College of Art & Design (www.otis.edu), Whitehouse.gov) The selected vendor will work under the direction of the Office of Congressional and External Relations located within the executive office of the Architect of the Capitol. Additionally, the selected vendor will operate in cooperation with the AOC Information Technology Division and will be required to undergo security and other background checks as stated in AOC policy and the vendor contract.

Appendix A Website Technical Guidelines and Standards

Design Standards ˇ Website textual content shall follow AOC standards for style, grammar, punctuation, and spelling as defined in the AOC Correspondence Manual and Style Guide. ˇ All websites shall be Section 508 compliant. ˇ Footers shall include AOC privacy policy and feedback links. ˇ All links should be displayed in a consistent style across all pages, as governed by a stylesheet. ˇ A consistent standard for "read more" type links shall be defined and utilized consistently across all pages. ˇ Because documents in a non-HTML/web MIME type (e.g. PDF or DOC) can take longer to load then standard web pages, links to these types of documents should be identified by including the file type in parentheses beside the link.

Technical Guidelines and Requirements ˇ Stylesheets shall be utilized whenever possible to ensure a consistent look and feel across the website and to enable global updates to be made without having to manually modify every page. ˇ To make video content cross-platform compatible, video content should be converted into Flash Video (flv) when possible. ˇ When possible, automated features/elements within CommonSpot (such as automated page indexes and dynamic site maps) should be used to help streamline the ongoing operations and maintenance of the web site. ˇ To make it easier to update the site's navigation and sub-navigation, all navigation items should be built within CommonSpot's sub-template (editable from the web-based front end) as opposed to within the main template (which resides and is only editable on the server itself). ˇ Relative URLs or CMS generated links shall be used whenever technically possible in order to make the site more portable and dynamic. ˇ Generated XML code should not be uploaded into the Commonspot CMS (e.g. HTML documents generated by MS Word), as they are known to conflict with the CMS and cause major problems. ˇ File names for templates, web pages, and uploaded documents should only use alphanumeric characters. Non-alphanumeric characters (e.g. spaces, !) are known to cause problems in selected browsers. ˇ Images used should be in either JPG or GIF format and should be optimized for the web. When possible, very large images should be minimized to avoid large download times. ˇ Each sub-page should include bread crumb navigation to help the end user navigate through the site. ˇ Each web page should include an appropriate Title and Description within the CommonSpot metadata panel. ˇ Each page and document should include a minimum of three relevant keywords in the metadata panel. The keywords allow the Verity search engine to locate and index web pages and documents.

Development Process ˇ Any design work and preliminary template work must first be implemented and tested in the AOC web development/test environment. ˇ Website redesigns shall be tested using a variety of browsers and connections to ensure pages are rendered appropriately and function as expected for most visitors: o Internet Explorer Browser (latest version & previous version) o Firefox Browser (latest version & previous version)

RFP100042

Page 9 of 43

o Safari Browser (latest version & previous version) o Testing for low-speed connections : All new web pages should be tested to ensure that load times are appropriate for end users on low-speed connections. Ideally, all pages should load within five seconds. ˇ Website redesigns and template changes can not be implemented in the production environment without proper approval via the ITD Change Control process. After the top-level web design template has been tested and approved in the development environment, ITD staff will implement the template on the production environment servers. Once the redesigned templates are implemented in production, individual content changes, sub-template edits and page cleanup can be done directly in the production environment using the CMS without going through the Change Control process. ˇ All major changes made by contract or AOC staff will be automatically logged in CommonSpot for security and auditing purposes.

52.246-4

Inspection of Services--Fixed-Price (Aug 1996)

(a) Definition. "Services," as used in this clause, includes services performed, workmanship, and material furnished or utilized in the performance of services. (b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the services under this contract. Complete records of all inspection work performed by the Contractor shall be maintained and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. (c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all times and places during the term of the contract. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (d) If the Government performs inspections or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (e) If any of the services do not conform with contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount. When the defects in services cannot be corrected by reperformance, the Government may(1) Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and (2) Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed. (f) If the Contractor fails to promptly perform the services again or to take the necessary action to ensure future performance in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may(1) By contract or otherwise, perform the services and charge to the Contractor any cost incurred by the Government that is directly related to the performance of such service; or (2) Terminate the contract for default. (End of clause)

(d) Payments can be made from the original amount obligated, but the undefinitized contract action must be definitized before payments exceed 40% of the funds originally obligated. (e) If communications are distrupted to the degree that it is necessary to communicate with the Contracting Officer at their residence or through other devices that do not utilize AOC-owned equipment, i.e., the Contracting Officer's residential telephone line, home address, etc., the contractor shall treat the Contracting Officer's personal information as confidential and shall not divulge the information to any individual or organization, including but not limited to other AOC personnel, without the Contracting Officer's express written permission. If it becomes necessary for the Contracting Officer to communicate with the contractor through means other than the contractor's normal place of business, i.e., the contractor's residential telephone line or home address, the Contracting Officer shall not divulge the information to any individual or organization, including but not limited to other AOC or contractor personnel, without the contractor's express written permission.

Any overpayments to the Contractor shall, unless otherwise adjusted, be repaid to the Government upon demand. (End of clause) AOC52.232-6 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Other than Central Contractor Registration (Jan 2010)

(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer. (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either-(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or (ii) Request the Government to delay payment until such time as the Government makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (c)). (b) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. (c) Changes after award to EFT information. (1) If any EFT information changes after award of the contract or if the Contractor seeks to correct EFT information previously submitted, the Contractor shall request the SF 3881, ACH VENDOR/MISCELLANEOUS PAYMENT ENROLLMENT FORM, and AOC Form 34-04-01, ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL VENDOR REQUEST FORM, from the Contracting Officer, complete the two forms, and submit them to the address designated in this paragraph. The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (b) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall send any changes to EFT information to the office designated in this paragraph of this clause. The Contractor shall not send EFT information to any other office and the Government need not use any EFT information sent to any office other than that designated in this paragraph. The designated office is: Architect of the Capital Procurement Division, Ford House Office Building 2nd and D Streets SW Washington, DC 20515 Telephone: (202) 226-1942 E-mail: accountingmyfax@aoc.gov Facsimile: (202) 225-3221 (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other clause of this contract, the Government is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a valid invoice. (4) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the Government shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than the 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT.

(d) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government failed to use the Contractor-provided EFT information in the correct manner, the Government remains responsible for-(i) Making a correct payment; and (ii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect at the time of Government release or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (c) shall apply. (e) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (c) of this clause to the designated office and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this clause. (f) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent. (g) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract. (l) The obligation of the Government to make any of the payments required under any of the provisions of this contract shall, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, be subject to: (1) Reasonable deductions on account of defects in material or workmanship; and (2) Any claims which the Government may have against the Contractor under or in connection with this contract. Any overpayments to the Contractor shall, unless otherwise adjusted, be repaid to the Government upon demand. (End of clause) AOC52.232-7 Discounts (Aug 2004)

(a) Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices. (b) In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of
RFP100042

Page 25 of 43

computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday and, for work performed in the District of Columbia, Presidential Inauguration Day, when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day. (End of clause) AOC52.232-12 Assignment - Supplement (Sep 2004)

Neither the contract nor any interest therein shall be assigned. However, moneys due or to become due under the contract may be assigned in accordance with the provisions of FAR clause 52.232-23 (ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS) as incorporated by reference in Section I.

(c) "Claim," as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $50,000 is not a claim under the Act until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under the Act. The submission may be converted to a claim under the Act, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time. (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer. For the purposes of this clause, all final decisions shall be rendered by the Architect of the Capitol's Director or Deputy Director, Procurement Division. (2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $50,000. (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim. (iii) The certification shall state as follows: "I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor." (3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim. (e) For Contractor claims of $50,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $50,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made. (f) The Contracting Officer s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals, within ninety days of receipt of a Contracting Officer s decision, to the Government Accountability Office Contract Appeals Board, 441 G Street NW, Room 7182, Washington, DC 20548; facsimile 202-512-9749 or e-mail CAB@gao.gov. (g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor s specific reasons for rejecting the offer. (h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim. (i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under or relating to the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer. (End of clause) AOC52.233-2 Claims for Equitable Adjustments - Waiver and Release of Claims (Jun 2004)

RFP100042

Page 26 of 43

equitable adjustment of the contract, such claim shall include all types of adjustments in the total amounts to which the paragraph entitles the Contractor, including but not limited to adjustments arising out of delays or disruptions or both caused by such change. Except as the parties may otherwise expressly agree, the Contractor shall be deemed to have waived (1) any adjustments to which it otherwise might be entitled under the paragraph where such claims fail to request such adjustments, and (2) any increase in the amount of equitable adjustments additional to those requested in its claim. (b) Further, the Contractor agrees that, if required by the Contracting Officer, he will execute a release, in form and substance satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, as part of the supplemental agreement setting forth the aforesaid equitable adjustment, and that such release shall discharge the Government, its officers, agents and employees, from any further claims, including but not limited to further claims arising out of delays or disruptions or both, caused by the aforesaid change. (End of clause) AOC52.245-2 Government-Furnished Property (Nov 2004)

(a) For the purposes of this clause, Government-furnished property includes cell phones and telephones, personal digital assistants, computers (including laptops), electronic devices, services such as network access, tools, furnished space, storage, utilities, furnishings, equipment, and any other item or service provided by the AOC to the contractor. (b) No AOC equipment or property can be provided under this contract unless specifically negotiated as part of the award price. If, after contract award, it becomes necessary or advisable to issue AOC property to the contractor, the contract price shall be reduced by a reasonable amount that reflects the price the contractor would pay if providing the property. (c) The Contracting Officer s Technical Representative (COTR) for this contract is responsible for coordinating the issuance and return of Government-furnished property. (d) Any Government-furnished property provided to the contractor for use during performance of this contract shall be issued to the contractor s representative and recorded on AOC Form 1423, AOC PROPERTY ISSUED TO CONTRACTORS. The contractor s representative shall be responsible for the ensuring the proper care and use of the Government-furnished property, whether used by the contractor representative or another contractor employee. Government-furnished property provided by the AOC can be used only for the conduct of official business on behalf of the AOC. The contractor is specifically prohibited from using AOC-furnished property for personal use or to conduct operations that benefit other Government agency contracts or other contractor activities that do not directly support AOC contracts. (e) All information technology property that requires interface or connection to the AOC network must be provided by the AOC. The use of non-AOC IT property that requires interface or connection to the AOC network is strictly prohibited. (f) All contractor employees who require access to the AOC network or who are issued a personal digital assistant must complete and sign the Non-disclosure Agreement for Contract Employees Conditional Access to Sensitive but Unclassified Information for The Architect of The Capitol before access will be granted. The COTR is responsible for providing the non-disclosure agreements to the AOC Office of Information Resources Management. (g) All Government-furnished property shall be returned by the contractor to the COTR in the same condition as issued, with allowances for wear and tear that occurs with reasonable care and use. Failure to return Government-furnished property or the return of Government-furnished property that has not been properly maintained and used may result in a reduction to the contract price that reflects the market replacement value of the property or the market price to repair or restore the property to its condition when issued to the contractor.

52.203-2

Certificate Of Independent Price Determination (Apr 1985)

(a) The offeror certifies that-(1) The prices in this offer have been arrived at independently, without, for the purpose of restricting competition, any consultation, communication, or agreement with any other offeror or competitor relating to-(i) Those prices; (ii) The intention to submit an offer; or (iii) The methods or factors used to calculate the prices offered. (2) The prices in this offer have not been and will not be knowingly disclosed by the offeror, directly or indirectly, to any other offeror or competitor before bid opening (in the case of a sealed bid solicitation) or contract award (in the case of a negotiated solicitation) unless otherwise required by law; and (3) No attempt has been made or will be made by the offeror to induce any other concern to submit or not to submit an offer for the purpose of restricting competition. (b) Each signature on the offer is considered to be a certification by the signatory that the signatory-(1) Is the person in the offeror's organization responsible for determining the prices being offered in this bid or proposal, and that the signatory has not participated and will not participate in any action contrary to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this provision; or (2)(i) Has been authorized, in writing, to act as agent for the following principals in certifying that those principals have not participated, and will not participate in any action contrary to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this provision [insert full name of person(s) in the offeror s organization responsible for determining the prices offered in this bid or proposal, and the title of his or her position in the offeror s organization]; (ii) As an authorized agent, does certify that the principals named in subdivision (b)(2)(i) of this provision have not participated, and will not participate, in any action contrary to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this provision; and (iii) As an agent, has not personally participated, and will not participate, in any action contrary to paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this provision. (c) If the offeror deletes or modifies paragraph (a)(2) of this provision, the offeror must furnish with its offer a signed statement setting forth in detail the circumstances of the disclosure.

TIN ______________________. (End of provision) 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Dec 2008)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are __ are not __ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have __ have not __, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (C) Are __ are not __ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have __, have not __, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

RFP100042

Page 31 of 43

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has __ has not __, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision.

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award

52.217-5

Evaluation of Options (July 1990)

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (End of provision) AOC52.215-5 Contract Award - Source Selection Procedures (Jun 2004)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors, specified elsewhere in this solicitation, considered. (b) The Government may (1) Reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; (2) Accept other than the lowest offer; and (3) Waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. (c) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror s initial proposal should contain the offeror s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (d) The Government may accept any item or combination of items, unless doing so is precluded by a restrictive limitation in the solicitation or the offer. (e) A written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer as provided in Paragraph (d) of this provision), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Negotiations conducted after receipt of an offer do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (f) Neither financial data submitted with an offer, nor representations concerning facilities or financing, will form a part of the resulting contract. However, if the resulting contract contains a clause providing for price reduction for defective cost or pricing data, the contract price will be subject to reduction if cost or pricing data furnished is incomplete, inaccurate, or not current. (g) The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or sub line items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (End of provision) AOC52.217-1 Evaluation of Options (Nov 2003)

Except when it is determined not to be in the Government's best interest, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for the selected options which include Line Item three (3) through ten (10); to the total price which includes the lump sum price, the line item pricing and the unit pricing. The estimated quantities given under the unit prices are for informational purposes only to provide the Government a price for evaluation purposes. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options. (End of Provision)

It may be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or any other legal entity. An entity that is organized for profit, has a place of business in the United States, and exceeds the size standard for its industry is a large business. An entity that is not organized for profit is a nonprofit organization, e.g., the American Red Cross, universities, and foundations. An entity organized for profit that is not in the United States is a foreign contractor. Small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, and HUBZone small business are each subsets of small business. Generally, not less than 51% of the business must be owned by the type of individual described in order to be considered of that category, e.g., in order to be a veteran-owned small business, not less than 51% of the business must be owned by one or more veterans with the management and daily business operations controlled by one or more veterans.
