PART I Â­ SOLICITATION GENERAL INFORMATION A. General Information 1. Through this Request for Proposals ("RFP"), the Smithsonian Institution ("Smithsonian") on behalf of its National Museum of American History ("NMAH") is seeking a firm to provide professional, technical, non-personal web design services ("Services") for the renovation and expansion of its Lemelson Center website ("Website"). The goal of the new website will be to consolidate, streamline and integrate existing sites, preferably using a site-wide database of available digital assets, and provide better access to information across the unified site while still creating features of interest to individual audiences. The successful redesigned Website will present a unified face to the public and make the most efficient use of information contained in the site and staff time dedicated to maintaining and growing the site. The purpose of this RFP is to provide all interested prospective offerors ("Offerors") with sufficient information to enable them to prepare and submit technical and business proposals (collectively, "Proposal(s)") for consideration by the Smithsonian. The information contained in the Proposals provided by Offerors will provide the basis for evaluation. This solicitation for services is a highly competitive process and to assure that Proposals are given full consideration, Offerors must adhere to the requirements set forth herein. All Proposals should reflect the Offeror's willingness and capability to provide professional services and a high quality product to the Smithsonian at a reasonable price. 2. Inquiries. All questions regarding this RFP should be directed solely to Chris Crane at cranec@si.edu. Offerors should not contact anyone else within the Smithsonian Institution regarding this RFP. Significant questions pertaining to this RFP will be entertained through October 11, 2012, 11:59 p.m. local Washington, DC time. All questions should reference specific sections of the solicitation including page number (s). All questions having an impact on the solicitation will be answered in writing and issued to all Offerors in the form of an amendment to this RFP. Strictly administrative questions will be entertained by phone, e-mail, or fax and may not be circulated to all Offerors. 3. The Smithsonian intends to award one (1) contract to the successful Offeror, but expressly reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel this RFP; and/or to terminate negotiations at any time without cost to or liability to the Smithsonian. 4. The Smithsonian reserves the right to reject any and all Proposals received by this request, or to negotiate separately with any firm when such action shall be considered in the best interest of the Smithsonian. Notice is also hereby given of the possibility that an award may be made without discussion or after only limited negotiations. It is therefore emphasized that all Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.

5. Offerors will not be reimbursed for any expense(s) incurred in the preparation and submission of Proposals, including without limitation costs associated with providing samples. Participation in this RFP or any resulting contract constitutes an affirmative waiver by participants of any claim to bid or proposal preparation costs. This RFP does not commit the Smithsonian to procure or contract for any services or supplies, and it shall not be construed as authorization to proceed or to be reimbursed for any of the work specified herein. 6. Smithsonian shall own and hold all proprietary rights, including copyright, in this RFP, the selected proposal, and all materials and work product created or generated in the fulfillment of the successful Offeror's duties under the awarded contract. Any and all information, photographs, or materials submitted with Proposals from Offerors for consideration by Smithsonian will become the property of Smithsonian and shall not be returned. 7. RFP Disclaimer. This RFP is being used to solicit offers solely to provide the specific services and products set forth herein and the resultant contract ("Contract") shall be nonexclusive in nature. The Smithsonian may contract with any other individual or entity for similar services and products and makes no guarantees that the Offeror selected hereunder will be subsequently hired to work on any other project whether similar or dissimilar, nor shall anything in this RFP be construed to so obligate the Smithsonian. 8. A debriefing is an opportunity for you to understand how the Smithsonian Institution assessed the strengths and weaknesses of your Proposals. Requests for a debriefing must be in writing no later than three (3) calendar days after receiving notice of award. 9. Time of Essence. Offerors are hereby put on notice that time is of the essence in the performance of the Contract and that the successful Offeror shall guarantee Smithsonian's receipt of the final approved product by no later than nine (9) months from award date. Failure to deliver the final product to the satisfaction of the Smithsonian by the stated deadline shall give the Smithsonian the right to terminate the Contract without any compensation to the successful Offeror. In the event of such failure to deliver within the time prescribed herein, Smithsonian shall have the right to procure the services and/or products from an alternate source and the Successful Offeror hereby agrees to pay reasonable costs incurred by the Smithsonian in reliance on the Successful Offeror's performance hereunder. 10. Project Schedule. As part of their proposals, Offerors shall submit a proposed project schedule for completion of all work effort required herein for Smithsonian's consideration. Upon award the agreed upon schedule shall be incorporated in the contract and the Contractor shall strictly adhere to said schedule in its performance under the contract. Contractor's schedule shall provide for an opportunity for Smithsonian to review and approve each deliverable as it is developed. 11. Statement of Work. All Services will be provided pursuant and subject to the attached Statement of Work. B. Project Description The Website was last redesigned in 2004 as an html/aspx hybrid, and limitations in both functionality and content presentation have developed over time as web technology has advanced. In addition, the Lemelson Center itself has expanded its scope with the addition of two physical

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 5 of 96

spaces with web presences: the Spark!Lab hands-on invention center (http://sparklab.si.edu) and the Lemelson Hall of Invention exhibition gallery. The Lemelson Hall featured an interactive, family-focused exhibition, Invention at Play (http://inventionatplay.org) until its closure in November 2011for the renovation of the Museum's west wing, in which the gallery is located. Planning is underway for Places of Invention (http://invention.smithsonian.org/places), the new exhibition for the Lemelson Hall, scheduled to open upon completion of the renovation in 2015. A proliferation of website addresses has accompanied the Center's expanding programs. Originally viewed as a positive step toward better brand identity, this practice has in fact led to confusion and intellectual disconnects among the various segments of our web presence. Both the Invention at Play site (inventionatplay.org) and the rudimentary Spark!Lab site (sparklab.si.edu) function separately from each other as well as from the main Lemelson Center website (invention.smithsonian.org). Furthermore, the main site contains legacy "microsites" in the "Centerpieces" section which also have little connection, technically or intellectually, to the other parts of the Center's web presence. The development of a site for the Places of Invention exhibition could add another independent, self-contained site to the list. Our goals for a renovation and expansion include assuring that visitors to our site, whether first-time or returning users, understand the mission of the Lemelson Center, and understand at all times that they are on the Lemelson Center website. As the importance of the Web as a basic tool for education, research, and open-ended exploration continues to grow, the Lemelson Center would benefit from consolidating and streamlining its websites in order to present a unified face to the public and to make the most efficient use of both the information contained in the site and of the limited staff time dedicated to maintaining and growing the site. By consolidating, streamlining, and integrating the sites, preferably using a site-wide database of available digital assets, we can provide better access to our information across the unified site while still creating features of interest to individual audiences. This renovation and expansion encompasses the creation of a single site that serves all of the Lemelson Center's functions and audiences in a unified structure, including expanded and enhanced Web presences for Spark!Lab and the Places of Invention research and exhibition project. In addition, we desire to transform the Lemelson Center website from what is primarily a broadcast mechanism to a participatory and lively community of Web visitors. An important objective behind the redesign of the website is to engage a larger, more diverse, global audience by creating a website capable of interfacing with and utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as social media and smart phone applications. Finally, the renovation and expansion includes the development of two new online components that will connect with in-gallery interactive experiences in the Places of Invention exhibition (details in section 2.1 below) and serve as the design core of the developing Places of Invention section of the website. As in the rest of the redesign, the Lemelson Center seeks a unified look-and-feel while acknowledging the special requirements of the Places of Invention topic. C. Submission of Proposals

1. Method and Date of Submittal. Offerors shall submit one (1) copy of the Technical Proposal and one (1) copy of the Business Proposal in pdf format via e-mail attachment to cranec@si.edu by no later than November 13, 2012, 9:00 AM Local Washington DC Time.

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 9 of 96

c. The Smithsonian may reject an offer as non-responsive if it is materially unbalanced as to prices for the requirements. An offer is unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices which are significantly overstated for other work. d. The Smithsonian reserves the right to cancel this solicitation in its entirety. E. Evaluation Procedures

1. Proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria being applied to the information requested in section D: a. Plan of Accomplishment (including schedule with creative and technical approaches to the Statement of Work, and a detailed description of the ways in which the plan reflects forward-looking, innovative web strategies and techniques). b. Firm's Experience and Past Performance (including samples of experience developing innovative content). c. Business Proposal (including final contract price, costs and itemized budget). 2. Price/Technical Proposal Trade-off and Award Decision/Best Value a. Contract(s) will be awarded to Offeror(s) the Smithsonian Institution determines can best meet the identified requirements based upon the Offeror's proposal(s). The Smithsonian Institution reserves the right in all cases to be the sole judge determining whether a respondent meets the evaluation criteria. A firm must be technically acceptable in order to be considered for award. b. It is anticipated a contract will be awarded to the Offeror(s) whose proposal when evaluating both the technical and business proposals is most advantageous and presents the best value to the Smithsonian Institution. Award of this Contract shall be made to the responsive, responsible Offeror(s) whose combined cost and technical proposal is in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, determined to be the most advantageous and in the best interests of Smithsonian Institution. c. Each Offeror's price shall be evaluated for reasonableness to determine the Offeror's understanding of the work effort and the ability to perform hereunder. The existence of adequate price competition will support a determination of reasonableness. This includes both original submissions and best and finals, if required. d. Since the evaluation of the price will represent a portion of the total evaluation, it is possible that an Offeror might not be selected for award because of unreasonable, unrealistic, incomplete, inaccurate, or non-current price proposal information. e. In conducting the evaluation, the Smithsonian may use data provided by the Offeror in its proposal as well as data obtained from other sources. While the Smithsonian may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete information rests with the Offeror.

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 10 of 96

3. Complete Information. Failure to furnish complete information requested in the RFP may cause the Offeror to be judged non-responsive and immediately be removed from further consideration. F. Contract Award

1. The Smithsonian reserves the right to (a) reject any or all offers if such action is in the best interest of the Smithsonian, (b) accept other than the lowest offer, and (c) waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 2. The Smithsonian reserves the right to award a contract or contracts on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions or any other contact concerning the proposals received. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. 3. A written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Smithsonian Institution may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Negotiations conducted after receipt of an offer do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Smithsonian Institution. 4. This request does not commit the Smithsonian to pay any preparation costs nor to make reimbursements for any of the cost associated with a response to this request.

Background PROJECT BACKGROUND
THE JEROME AND DOROTHY LEMELSON CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF INVENTION AND INNOVATION (THE "CENTER") WAS FOUNDED AT THE SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN HISTORY (NMAH) IN 1995 THROUGH A GENEROUS GIFT FROM THE LEMELSON FOUNDATION. THE CENTER'S MISSION IS TO DOCUMENT, INTERPRET, AND DISSEMINATE INFORMATION ABOUT INVENTION AND INNOVATION, TO ENCOURAGE INVENTIVE CREATIVITY IN YOUNG PEOPLE, AND TO FOSTER AN APPRECIATION FOR THE CENTRAL ROLE INVENTION AND INNOVATION PLAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. BUILDING ON THE UNIQUE RESOURCES OF NMAH, THE CENTER SEEKS INNOVATIVE WAYS TO: RECORD THE PAST BY PRESERVING AND INCREASING ACCESS TO RECORDS AND ARTIFACTS; BROADEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORY THROUGH RESEARCH, DISCUSSION, AND THE DISSEMINATION OF IDEAS; AND LOOK TO THE FUTURE BY DEVELOPING PROGRAMS AIMED AT ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE STUDY AND EXPLORATION OF INVENTION AND INNOVATION.

The Lemelson Center's website (http://invention.smithsonian.org) serves as an introduction to the educational and scholarly work of the Center. The site offers a variety of information, from calendar events and newsletters to in-depth explorations of invention topics, research aids, and online exhibitions, among other features. SMITHSONIAN BACKGROUND The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a trust instrumentality of the United States founded in 1846 in response to the will of Englishman James Smithson who bequeathed the whole of his property to the United States of America "to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge." In the 160 plus years since that time the Smithsonian has grown to include 19 museums, the National Zoological Park, and 9 research centers located in Washington, DC and its metropolitan area, New York City, NY, Cambridge, MA, Fort Pierce, FL, and Panama. The Smithsonian employs approximately 6,000 staff, has nearly 140 million collection objects, and in 2008, hosted over 25 million visitors at its core museum locations and over 172 million visitors to its public websites. Today the Institution in addition to its Trust financing, also receives a significant portion of its budget from the United States government and therefore must comply with certain Federal mandates regarding information technology and security. The Smithsonian's Lemelson Center is physically located in the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC. Purpose and Objectives: The Lemelson Center's website was last redesigned in 2004 as an html/aspx hybrid, and limitations in both functionality and content presentation have developed over time as Web technology has advanced. In addition, the Lemelson Center itself has expanded its scope with the addition of two physical spaces with Web presences: the Spark!Lab hands-on invention center (http://sparklab.si.edu) and the Lemelson Hall of Invention exhibition gallery. The Lemelson Hall featured an interactive, family-focused exhibition, Invention at Play (http://inventionatplay.org) until its closure in November 2011for the renovation of the

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 14 of 96

Museum's west wing, in which the gallery is located. Planning is underway for Places of Invention (http://invention.smithsonian.org/places), the new exhibition for the Lemelson Hall, scheduled to open upon completion of the renovation in 2015. An exciting feature of Places of Invention will be its interactive features that will connect visitors in the gallery with users of the companion Web presence (more information on plans for the Places of Invention section of the website are included in Section 2.2). A proliferation of website addresses has accompanied the Center's expanding programs. Originally viewed as a positive step toward better brand identity, this practice has in fact led to confusion and intellectual disconnects among the various segments of our Web presence. The Invention at Play site (inventionatplay.org) and the rudimentary Spark!Lab (sparklab.si.edu) and Places of Invention (invention.smithsonian.org/places) sites function separately from each other as well as from the main Lemelson Center website (invention.smithsonian.org). Furthermore, the main site contains legacy "microsites" in the "Centerpieces" section which also have little connection, technically or intellectually, to the other parts of the Center's Web presence. Our goals for a renovation and expansion include assuring that visitors to our site, whether first-time or returning users, understand the mission of the Lemelson Center, and understand at all times that they are on the Lemelson Center website. As the importance of the Web as a basic tool for education, research, and open-ended exploration continues to grow, the Lemelson Center would benefit from consolidating and streamlining its websites in order to present a unified face to the public and to make the most efficient use of both the information contained in the site and of the limited staff time dedicated to maintaining and growing the site. By consolidating, streamlining, and integrating the sites, preferably using a site-wide database of available digital assets, we can provide better access to our information across the unified site while still creating features of interest to individual audiences. This renovation and expansion encompasses the creation of a single site that serves all of the Lemelson Center's functions and audiences in a unified structure, including expanded and enhanced Web presences for Spark!Lab and the Places of Invention research and exhibition project. In addition, we desire to transform the Lemelson Center website from what is primarily a broadcast mechanism to a participatory and lively community of Web visitors. An important objective behind the renovation and expansion of the website is to engage a larger, more diverse, global audience by creating a website capable of interfacing with and utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as social media and smart phone applications. We also envision a website in which moderated user-contributed content will grow exponentially. The Lemelson Center engaged R/P Marketing Public Relations to study its current website and develop recommendations for the renovation and expansion. The findings of this study are summarized in Section 2.2 below and the full report is available by request. THE CURRENT LEMELSON CENTER SITE The current Lemelson Center website serves a range of audiences, from teachers, students, and families to scholars and other history professionals. The main sections of the current site are listed below. Note: The Lemelson Center seeks the Contractor's advice on reorganizing the site content for ease of use and to promote integration of the Center's scholarly and educational arms. The Center also seeks ideas for enhancing its presence on the NMAH and SI main websites.

THE NEW LEMELSON CENTER SITE To prepare for the renovation and expansion, the Lemelson Center contracted a strategic analysis of the current site and to establish the purpose, intended audiences, and measurable goals for the new site (The full report is available by request). Purpose The Lemelson Center exists to further understanding and appreciation of the belief that both the spirit and act of invention and innovation hold vast and varied value. To aid in the furthering of a mission well-grounded in "fostering" and "encouraging" our individual audience members, the purpose of the website is defined as follows: The Lemelson Center website delivers meaningful and lasting growth experiences to site visitors by fostering an understanding and appreciation of the central role of invention and innovation in the history and future of the United States. Audience Three primary audiences for Lemelson Center content were identified: Ë Researchers Ë Children (ages 6-12) visiting the site with a parent/families Ë Niche adults, i.e., those having a significant personal interest in innovation and invention Measurable goals: A number of metrics were identified to measure the success of the new site: f. Decrease in the current bounce rate as an indication of increased experience satisfaction. g. Metrics currently used to measure engagement (e.g., number of pages per visit, amount of time spent on site) are recommended as general benchmark considerations. h. Listening and documenting the comments and tone of "social buzz" as part of interactive measurement efforts. i. Direct engagement, such as signing up for a newsletter or downloading an activity from Spark!Lab (or some other form of content). j. Documenting the amount of content that is "shared." 1. Overview of renovation and expansion Guided by these goals, the Smithsonian's Lemelson Center seeks a contractor to completely redesign the graphic look-and-feel, content management framework, and navigation structure of the site. With Lemelson Center staff, the contractor will reorganize, refine, and rethink the navigation structure of the site. The design approach should reflect a growing understanding of learning as a hybrid of formal education and self-directed discovery that can be brought together and enhanced by online tools. The newly-designed site should be integrated, interactive, and scaleable. We desire:

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 19 of 96

Ë A unified look-and-feel that makes it clear to visitors that they are viewing Lemelson Center content at all times, integrating the special nature of the content in the Spark!Lab and Places of Invention sections of the website. Rather than separate standalone sites for Spark!Lab and Places of Invention, the renovation and expansion will result in a single site that creates visually- and intellectually-related portions of the website serving Spark!Lab and Places of Invention. The contractor will be responsible for developing and integrating all three components of the Lemelson Center's website. Ë A clear and intuitive navigation scheme. Ë Creation of a robust database/content management system to maintain and serve content. Ë A site that is fully accessible, meeting the Web accessibility guidelines set forth by the Web Accessibility Initiative (see http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php) and fully functional on multiple platforms, from Macs and PCs to smartphones and other mobile devices. Advice on translating site content into Spanish is also desired. Ë Integration of our social media outlets, website, podcast presence on iTunes, and video on YouTube and Vimeo. Ë Integration of scholarly and educational content through use of multimedia, interactivity, and an expanded range of materials offered to researchers. Ë Varied and appropriate methods for community interaction through the website.

Places of Invention While creating the structure for content related to the Places of Invention exhibition is included in this renovation and expansion (more information on the exhibition is available by request), a special requirement is the integration of ingallery experiences for the Places of Invention exhibition and the new website. The Lemelson Center is working with the design firm Roto for the gallery exhibition, which includes interactive features for Museum visitors. Two of these activities will be integrated with the Lemelson Center website. The first activity is a form of interactive map that will allow visitors to add content (text, images, video, audio) about their personal places of invention, from home workshops to geographical locations. The map will also appear on the website, with content shared and synchronized between the website and the gallery. The second feature is the "build a place of invention" activity that will offer visitors the opportunity to interact with each other as they contribute to an everchanging invented town. Again, this feature will be incorporated into the website as well, with content shared and synchronized between the website and the gallery. The Contractor and Roto will be required to coordinate functionality, user interface, and design considerations for these features. Roto will be responsible for the design, fabrication, programming, and installation of the interactive map and "build a place of invention" activities in the gallery. The Contractor and Roto will work together to ensure that the assets and information submitted by visitors onsite and online are uploaded seamlessly to the interactive map and "build a

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 20 of 96

place of invention" features in the gallery and on the website. This will include, but is not limited to:
Ë Ë Ë Ë the automatic, seamless, and continuous syncing of moderated user-generated content submitted through kiosks in the exhibition and through the website the expectation of the submission of increasing amounts of moderated usergenerated content over time the ability to search content the inclusion of a work-flow structure for moderating submitted content

REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor will work closely with Lemelson Center staff to conceptualize the site, develop new ways to reach our audiences, enhance the branding of our material, and design all pages, including choosing the color palette and typography, navigational tools, and layout grid. The Contractor will work closely with the design firm Roto on the realization and coordination of the two Places of Invention exhibition interactive features described in Section 2.2. The Contractor will advise the Lemelson Center on the advantages and disadvantages of open source and proprietary systems, including, but not limited to, Drupal and HTML5. The Contractor will perform all production work, including programming, incorporation of all site components, and creation of all links. The Contractor will designate a project manager who will coordinate with SI, oversee all requested changes, provide quality control, and act as a liaison with SI. Lemelson Center staff will provide the all content assets (including, but not limited to, text, images, audio, and video) for the website. Mutually agreed-upon deliverables and the end product will be subject to the Smithsonian's final written approval, as provided in the awarded contract. SI shall have ownership of all source files including images, audio, video, related code, documentation, site files, and content used in the finished product. This project may be awarded as design-build at best value.

ANALYSIS

The Lemelson Center has undertaken a study of its current site and its users to inform the renovation and expansion (report is available by request). The renovation and expansion of the Lemelson Center's Web presence shall align with the general direction established in this new strategy. Core recommendations from the study include:
Ë Intensify brand influence on site Strategic and judicious usage of the Smithsonian and Lemelson brands must be a priority. Additionally, a stronger color palette, a more consistent visual theme, and a more definitive brand positioning as the visitor hits the page would improve the experience and positively influence the site's current low bounce rate. Improve home page "above the fold" presence As the use of higher resolution of monitors has rapidly advanced, developers have "gained space." A tighter design, with the clear purpose of providing the visitor with a confirming first impression and relevant messaging, should be considered when developing the home page, with acute emphasis on content featured "above the fold." Strengthen visual hierarchy As the visitor enters the site, there is a need to provide a clear path to the content we want them to consume and act upon. As we look to develop the site's broad look and feel, any design should make certain the site maintains a purposeful visual content plan that supports prioritized content flow and engagement opportunities for each specified primary audience. Lead with a strong statement A clear development design objective should be to make certain the homepage leads with a bold statement related to both the brand and the site purpose. Clarify navigation and content choices Primary navigation and menu choices should provide meaningful and understandable definitions related to underlying content.

Ë

During the analysis phase, the Contractor shall:
Ë Analyze the study and use other Smithsonian Delivered Information (see Section 2.9) as background material to identify additional requirements beyond those identified in Section 2.2. Analyze the current pages listed in Section 2.1 and identify additional content which will need to be provided to create a more welcoming and complete experience for the virtual visitor. Discuss with the Lemelson Center content that should be considered for removal from the site. The Lemelson Center will provide the agreed upon additional content to the Contractor.

Ë

The above analysis will be documented in a Content & Architecture Analysis Report, and the Contractor and the Lemelson Center shall meet to discuss clarifications in the report so that the Lemelson Center can make a final determination on the recommendations to be included in this effort.

Technology
All development work produced under contracts or otherwise must conform to the Smithsonian's high level system architecture(s), centrally supported web infrastructure, security infrastructure, and comply with the Smithsonian's Technology Reference Model (TRM), SD-940-01. Typically, larger web projects or projects that might require newer or alternative support requirements are also subject to review through the OCIO Technical Review Board (TRB). For guidance on the TRB process, consult with the System Architecture and Product Assurance division. The Smithsonian has a central web delivery infrastructure that is supported by the Office of the Chief Information Officer's Web Services Division and provided to all SI museums / units. Smithsonian Directive, SD-950, Management of the Smithsonian Web addresses the policies and procedures required to ensure the integrity of our content, reliability of our Web infrastructure, and usability of our websites while protecting the privacy of our visitors and the reputation of the Institution through proper Web management practices. The infrastructures is Windows / Intelbased and consists of staging / content management servers, SQL database servers, loadbalanced web / web application servers, reporting, and search servers. Ë Staging / Content Management: SI uses a central staging Â­ deployment model under which ALL site files are copied by the site manager to a staging / content management server that sits within SI's internal network. This internal "master" copy of the site is deployed to loadbalanced sets of web / web application servers that reside within SI's DMZ. All file content must be deployed via this staging Â­ deployment infrastructure. The Smithsonian uses Interwoven's TeamSite v. 7.2.1 web content management system which is centrally funded and supported. Museums and organizations are given their own dedicated branch and workareas in which to maintain their sites. TeamSite automatically provides versioning and the ability to create snap-shot editions of sites at given points in time. TeamSite also includes rich templating functionality which may or may not be used in a site's design. If a site design includes content management functionality, TeamSite must be used. No separate COTS or independently developed CM systems are allowed. Databases: SI's web database server environment is made up primarily of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Enterprise Edition servers running on 64 bit Windows Server 2008 in a clustered environment. The use of MS Access databases is not permitted within SI's web infrastructure, though Access may be used for development purposes before being migrated to SQL Server. Ë Web / Web Application Servers: SI's Web Services Division currently supported web / web application servers are 64 Bit Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Edition running IIS 7.5. ASP / ASP.NET, and ActivePERL are supported. WSD supports both shared and dedicated hosting models. The majority of current SI sites reside on shared servers. SI desires to migrate to a situation where the sites of the larger organizations reside on dedicated servers. All web servers are deployed in load-balanced sets behind a pair of Cisco content switches. This means that each web site is duplicated and served by two or more servers. The content switch(es) provides load-balancing and session management so this is invisible to the end user. This configuration provides complete, live redundancy and allows a server to be taken off-line for maintenance without bringing the site down.

Ë

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 38 of 96

Should site traffic increase to a point where performance is affected, additional servers can be added to the set to handle the additional load. No direct logon on to the web servers is permitted. All file changes must be deployed via the staging infrastructure. SI's Intranet websites are served from servers located within a DMZ subnet that are logically and physically separate from SI's Intranet web servers. ColdFusion 9 are supported within the above infrastructure along with ASP / ASP.NET Versions: 1.1 through 4.0 plus Microsoft AJAX Extensions for ASP.NET 2.0 and PHP 5.3.5. Ë Drupal/WordPress Applications on LAMP Servers: Since December 2010, SI's SAPA Division started to support Drupal/WordPress applications on LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) common platform servers which are 64 Bit Intel Server. WSD supports both Drupal 6.27 and 7.14 as well as WordPress 3.3.2 applications. The Drupal and WordPress sites reside on virtual LAMP servers and depending on the version and units needs. Reporting: SI's Web Services Division provides WebTrends 9.2 reporting for unit website statistics using logs files and also SDC (SmartSource Data Collector) Search: Since May 2010, SI has operated a Google GB-9009 Enterprise Search Appliance cluster that is centrally maintained by SI's Web Services Division (WSD) for search within SI public websites. This Google appliance is made available to all SI unit public web sites for setup of site-specific collections / sub-collections (views) using normal crawls. There is no charge for common .html and dynamic websites. However, museums / units with extremely large data-driven sites (e.g. those generating 100,000 + search records) will be required to fund the acquisition of additional search licenses in order to have their sites indexed by the appliance. Internal (non-public) site search functionality is provided by a smaller, separate Google GB-7007 Enterprise Search Appliance, also managed by WSD. WSD will provide assistance to units for the creation and generation of site maps for their dynamic content.

All services and the Products produced hereunder shall be in full compliance with and conform to all Smithsonian Directives and Policies including without limitation the following: Ë Smithsonian Directive (SD) 950 Â­ Web Management Ë IT-950-TN01 Â­ Web Copyright & Privacy Notices Ë IT-950-TN02 Â­ Internet Domain Names Ë IT-950-TN03 Â­ Public FTP Server Accounts Ë IT-950-TN04- Public Website & Web-Based Deliverables Developments Ë SD 940 Acquisition of Information Technology Products C. 9. Information on Smithsonian's Web Infrastructure: The Smithsonian has a production central web delivery infrastructure that is supported by the Office of the Chief Information Officer's Web Services Division ("WSD") and provided to all Smithsonian museums/units. WSD supports over a hundred public websites and over 50 internal websites with a limited staff and budget and, therefore, must enforce a set of common infrastructure standards. Smithsonian's centrally-managed web infrastructures is Windows/Intel-based and consists of staging/content management servers, SQL database servers, load-balanced web/web application servers, reporting, and search servers. Smithsonian does not have a centrally provided development

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 66 of 96

environment. The Contractor is expected to develop the Products on and conduct beta testing within their own development environment. When beta testing is complete, the Contractor shall work with WSD to load the finished Products into the production environment, then conduct final pre-launch testing to verify functionality before the site is made live (available to the intended end audience). C.10. Staging/Content Management. Smithsonian uses a central staging Â­ deployment model under which ALL site files are copied by the site manager to a staging/content management server that sits within Smithsonian's internal network. This internal "master" copy of the site is deployed to load-balanced sets of web/web application servers that reside within Smithsonian's DMZ. All file content must be deployed via this staging Â­ deployment infrastructure. The Smithsonian uses Interwoven's TeamSite v. 6.5 web content management system which is centrally funded and supported. Museums and organizations are given their own dedicated branch and work areas in which to maintain their sites. TeamSite automatically provides versioning and the ability to create snap-shot editions of sites at given points in time. TeamSite also includes rich templating functionality which may or may not be used in a site's design. If a site design includes custom content management functionality, TeamSite must be used. No separate COTS or independently developed CM systems are allowed. C.11. Databases. Smithsonian's web database server environment is made up primarily of Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Edition servers running on Windows Server 2003 in a clustered environment. There are also several non-clustered MS SQL Server 2005 servers, also running on Windows Server 2003. As existing database servers / clusters are replaced and new servers / clusters brought on line, they will be MS SQL Server 2005. The use of MS Access databases is not permitted within Smithsonian's web infrastructure, though Access may be used for development purposes before being migrated to SQL Server. C.12. Web/Web Deliverables Servers. SI's Web Services Division currently supported web / web application servers are 64 Bit Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Edition running IIS 7.5. ASP / ASP.NET, and ActivePERL are supported. WSD supports both shared and dedicated hosting models. The majority of current SI sites reside on shared servers. SI desires to migrate to a situation where the sites of the larger organizations reside on dedicated servers. All web servers are deployed in load-balanced sets behind a pair of Cisco content switches. This means that each web site is duplicated and served by management so this is invisible to the end user. This configuration provides complete, live redundancy and allows a server to be taken off-line for maintenance without bringing the site down. Should site traffic increase to a point where performance is affected, additional servers can be added to the set to handle the additional load. No direct logon on to the web servers is permitted. All file changes must be deployed via the staging infrastructure. SI's Intranet websites are served from servers located within a DMZ subnet that are logically and physically separate from SI's Intranet web servers. ColdFusion 9 are supported within the above infrastructure along with ASP / ASP.NET Versions: 1.1 through 4.0 plus Microsoft AJAX Extensions for ASP.NET 2.0 and PHP 5.3.5. Drupal/WordPress Applications on LAMP Servers: Since December 2010, SI's SAPA Division started to support Drupal/WordPress applications on LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP)

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 67 of 96

common platform servers which are 64 Bit Intel Server. WSD supports both Drupal 6.27 and 7.14 as well as WordPress 3.3.2 applications. The Drupal and WordPress sites reside on virtual LAMP servers and depending on the version and units needs. C.13. Reporting. Contractor shall develop the CMS to allow for statistical data reporting. Every page request will be logged on the server which includes without limitation pages viewed on the Website, as well as pages viewed on the native devices. The full URL to the page (including any parameters) will be logged with a timestamp and session ID. For native applications, the unique device ID will be logged as well and all logged information will be stored in the MySQL database. Contractor's reports will capture page hits over daily, weekly and monthly intervals, ordered by frequency. Contractor shall develop the code for the Products to generate this primary set of reports from the logged data. Any generated reports will be served from the CMS as HTML, XML or JSON pages; and access will be restricted to those who have access to the CMD. C.14. Search. Smithsonian has implemented a Google GB-5005 Enterprise Search Appliance cluster that is centrally maintained by Smithsonian's Web Services Division (WSD) for search within Smithsonian public websites. This Google appliance is made available to all Smithsonian unit public web sites for setup of site-specific collections / sub-collections (views) using normal crawls.

G.9 Incorporation of Contractor's Proposal. It is understood and agreed that the Contractor shall, in meeting the requirements of this Contract, perform the work in accordance with its proposal which is attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment J.3.

Section H - Special Contract Requirements H.1 Use of Smithsonian Names. Contractor is hereby put on notice that Smithsonian owns, controls, and/or has registered the trademarks/service marks "Smithsonian", "Smithsonian Institution", the Smithsonian sunburst logo and the names of its other museums, organizations and facilities (the "Names"). Contractor further acknowledges the great value of the prestige, publicity, and goodwill associated with the Names, and in such connection, acknowledges that such goodwill belongs exclusively to Smithsonian and that the Names have acquired a secondary meaning in the mind of the purchasing public as a source of museum services and museum products. Contractor agrees that it shall not knowingly harm, misuse, or bring into disrepute the Names, and will assist Smithsonian as it may reasonably request in preserving the integrity and dignity of the Names and any trademark interest therein. H.1.1 Restricted Uses. Except as may be otherwise provided herein, Contractor shall not without Smithsonian's prior, written approval refer to the Smithsonian Institution or to any of its museums, programs, organizations, or facilities in any manner or through any medium, whether written, oral, or visual for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, advertising, marketing, promotion, publicity, solicitation, or fund-raising. Contractor shall not have the Names printed on its letterhead stationery or brochures advertising non-Smithsonian sponsored activities. H.1.2 Permitted Uses. Notwithstanding anything in the Contract to the contrary, Contractor may make casual or factual reference to the Names in a way, which does not bear on Contractor's obligations herein or the service thereof. Contractor may make use of the Names in a client "resume" format, so long as Contractor lists Smithsonian among all or a significant portion of its

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 74 of 96

other clients, without placing the Names in a prominent position, prominent or different typeface, or otherwise placing the Names so as to draw special attention to them among other client names. The preferred method is to arrange client names according to either alphabetical order or chronologically, according to number of years that Contractor has provided service to each client. H.1.3 Smithsonian Approvals. Contractor's use of the Names shall maintain the dignity and integrity of the Smithsonian. All of the language, phrases, format, and/or layout concerning or referring to the Names pertaining to the subject matter of this Contract shall be submitted to Smithsonian for Smithsonian's prior written approval. Once Smithsonian has approved such materials, Contractor may continue to use such materials without further approval, provided that there are no significant changes in text, layout, content, or design. Contractor shall place an appropriate notice of trademark ownership or federal trademark registration next to all of the Names as they are displayed. Any inadvertent failure shall not constitute a breach of this Contract. H.2 Changes. The Smithsonian Contracting Officer may at any time, in writing, make changes within the general scope of this Contract to include: Technical requirements and descriptions, specifications, statements of work; place of delivery, inspection or acceptance; and reasonable adjustments in quantities or delivery schedules or both.

Contractor shall not make any changes without the advance written consent of the Smithsonian Contracting Officer. Funds are not presently available for the any additional services beyond those set forth herein. The Smithsonian's obligation under this Contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

"Claims", as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of Contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this Contract.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $50,000 is not a claim until certified as required by subparagraph (c)(ii) below. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim. If the submission is disputed, either as to liability or amount, or if it is not acted upon in a reasonable time, it may be converted to a claim by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause. (c) CLAIMS PROCEDURE. (1) SUBMITTING CLAIMS. A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Smithsonian Institution against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer. (2) CERTIFICATION OF CLAIMS. For Contractor claims exceeding $50,000, the Contractor shall submit with the claim a certification that: (i) The claim is made in good faith; (ii) Supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief; and (iii) The amount requested accurately reflects the Contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Smithsonian Institution is liable. (3) WHO SHALL CERTIFY. If the Contractor is an individual, the certification shall be executed by that individual. If the Contractor is not an individual, the certification shall be executed by: (i) A senior company official in charge at the Contractor's plant or location involved; or (ii) An officer or general partner of the Contractor having overall responsibility for the conduct of the Contractor's affairs. (d) TIME LIMITS FOR CLAIMS DECISIONS. For Contractor claims of $50,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made. (e) APPEALS. The decision of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive unless, within 30 days from the date of receipt of such copy, the Contractor mails or otherwise furnishes to the Contracting Officer a written appeal addressed to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The decision of the Smithsonian Institution Secretary or

Smithsonian Institution Solicitation #F13SOL10001 : Lemelson Center Website Renovation and Expansion page 93 of 96 his duly authorized representative for the determination of such appeals shall be final and conclusive unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been fraudulent, or capricious, or arbitrary, or so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, or not supported by substantial evidence. In connection with any appeal proceeding under this clause, the Contractor shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence in support of its appeal. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this Contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the Contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer. (f) INTEREST ON CLAIMS. The Smithsonian Institution shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from: (1) the date the Contracting Officer receives the claim (properly certified if required), or (2) the date payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury during the pendency of the claim.

53 52.243-S0054 Technical Directives
(a) Performance of work under this Contract is subject to the review and direction of the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative. Pursuant to this authority, the Contracting Officer, Project Manager, or Resident Project Manager, may issue technical directives within the scope of the Contract statement of work without notice to sureties, if any, for the purpose of: (1) Filling in previously unspecified details of the technical requirement; (2) Shifting emphasis between work areas or tasks, or requiring the pursuit or cessation of certain approaches or lines of inquiry; (3) Approving technical reports, drawings, specifications, and other technical data; (4) Providing guidance, advice definitions, and other information which assists in the interpretation of drawings, specifications, or other technical aspects of the work description. (b) Directives which have an impact on the total Contract costs, or which have the effect of relieving the Contractor of responsibilities for which he has contracted, will not be issued under this Contract clause. Such directives will be issued by the Contracting Officer under other provisions of this Contract. Technical directives will be issued in writing by the Contracting Officer, Project Manager, or Resident Project Manager. (c) The Contractor will promptly acknowledge in writing to the Contracting Officer the receipt of all technical directives and will comply with all such technical directives in accordance with their terms. However, if the Contractor deems that acceptance of a particular technical directive would change any Contract provision, including stated technical, schedule, cost, incentive or other Contract provisions, or effects any other change which would, if directed by the Contracting Officer under any other provision of this Contract, create a right to an equitable adjustment on the part of either of the contracting parties, or if the Contractor takes technical exception to a technical directive or questions its contractual authority, he will so notify the Contracting officer in writing within five (5) working days after receipt of the technical directive. If the Contracting Officer agrees with the Contractor's finding, he will, within ten (l0) working days, either ratify the technical directive by issuance of an appropriate Contract modification, or rescind the Technical Directive. If the Contracting Officer determines that the technical directive is valid and appropriate as originally issued, he will so notify the Contractor in writing within ten (l0) working days, and the Contractor will proceed with the work thereunder. (d) Failure of the contracting parties to agree hereunder shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause of this Contract entitled "Disputes."

The Contractor will not be entitled to any extension of Contract time or payment for costs incurred as a result of being ordered to stop work for such cause.
