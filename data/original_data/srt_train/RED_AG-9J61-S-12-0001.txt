ATTACHMENT A COMPUTER/PRINTER/SCANNER RENTAL SPECIFICATIONS
Contractor Provided Equipment. Equipment shall meet all standards established by specification or incorporated by reference and shall be maintained in good repair by the Contractor. The Contractor shall provide equipment including software, software installed, hardware, and consumables as stated. No substitutions are permitted. The contractor shall provide updated Microsoft WinXP Security Patches as they become available. There shall be no additional charges for the patches. Government Provided Services, Licensing, and Software: The Government GIS software installs will be coordinated through the USFS Region 5 Fire & Aviation Management GIS Lab. (*See attached). Licenses will be provided under existing USFS Enterprise Licensing Agreements. GIS software shall be fully functional upon arrival in the field. When returned to the vendor from field use, GIS computers shall be wiped, reimaged/reinstalled, licenses reset and shall be ready for the next order. (*ESRI approved process under the ELA with the Forest Service). Ordering quantities (minimum): The Government anticipates that the minimum initial order of (20) total units combined quantities of the type 1, 2, and 3 (i.e. Type 1/ 17 units, Type 2/ 2 units and Type 3/ 2 units)with a total number per incident estimated not to exceed 35 units. Due to the variables of size of each incident it is hard to estimate the quantity needed per incident. Therefore, the probability of numerous incidents and various needs may occur at one time. Because of this the Government is anticipating that supplemental orders above the original estimate of (20-35) units can occur but are anticipated to not exceed 5 times this minimum quantity (100-165 units), based on 5 incidents at one time. Dispatching/Ordering of Equipment: All awarded BPA contractors will be placed on a dispatch priority list by Geographic Area (No Ops / So Ops). Priority is given to price offered. This BPA does not preclude the Government from using any Agency or Agency Cooperator owned resources before mobilizing a resource order for this BPA. Delivery requirements are as follows: The Government requires that units are to be received within a 24 hour period of the initial order. Units shall be shipped next day air. Units shall be packaged, wrapped with foam or bubble wrap within the container (box). The contractor shall be responsible for tracking of their equipment at all times in order to substantiate invoicing charges for shipping, rental period, etc. The contractor must be able to arrange for special delivery for locations that do not allow for next day delivery. In this case, the contractor shall be paid on delivery costs to the Incident Location based on a per mile charge after a 100 mile minimum one way at the current GSA Federal Travel rates. A special handling fee of $200 may also apply. Logistics charges acceptable are as follows: (a) Federal Express billed with Contractors Invoice as a delivery charge (b) Commercial airline billed on Contractor Invoice with delivery charges. 1

Payment: All payments for this BPA will be processed by a commercial invoice delivered with equipment to the incident. Finance will execute an I-Suite Invoice along with the contractor's commercial invoice and submitted for payment. Payments are then forwarded to the Albuquerque Service Center (ASC). No payment shall be made by credit card under this agreement. A commercial Invoice from the vendor shall include the following: (a) Resource Order with assigned "S" number (b) fire name (c ) fire number (d) location of the fire (e) quantity of items being requested and shipping costs to and from the incident (estimated), (f) contact person to receipt of equipment ordered (g) timeframe estimated for rental shall be stated as End of Incident (h) Each incident resource order shall be considered the financial ordering document/call order for this BPA. Contractor shall invoice on a monthly basis. Loss, Damage, or Destruction: For equipment furnished under this BPA the Government will assume liability for any loss, damage, or destruction of such equipment, except that no reimbursement bill be made for loss, damage or destruction due to (1 ) ordinary wear or tear, (2) mechanical failure, or (3) the fault or negligence of the contractor or the Contractor's agents or employees or Government employee owned and operated equipment.
