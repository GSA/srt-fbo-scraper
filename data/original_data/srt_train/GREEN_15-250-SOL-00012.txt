GPAT Overview for Vendors Instructions for Completing the GPAT
1. Purpose

This document provides vendors with instructions on completing the Government Product Accessibility Template (GPAT) required to be submitted with solicitation responses.

2.

Background

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states that all Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) acquired by Federal agencies must be accessible to people with disabilities. In 2001, the Information Technology Industry Council partnered with the General Services Administration (GSA) to create a tool that would assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements specified in Section 508. The result of their collaboration was the *Government Product Accessibility Template (GPAT).

3.

What is a GPAT?

The GPAT lists the mandatory Section 508 accessibility criteria (sections and provisions) relevant to the pending EIT acquisition. Federal agencies distribute a customized GPAT with all solicitations that contain EIT deliverables. You must complete and submit the GPAT along with your solicitation response to demonstrate how your solution complies with the Section 508 Standards.

4.

GPAT Format and Instructions

The GPAT consists of one summary table that is followed by one or more section tables. Each section table references the section of the 508 Standards that HRSA identified as applying to the expected deliverables, and includes the provisions (requirements) of the cited section. Vendors must first complete all the included section tables and explain how their product meets the stated provisions. Then, vendors must complete the summary table based on the responses given in the section tables. *VPAT Note: If you are using a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) program with an associated Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) within your solution, a VPAT can be provided to address 508 requirements. However, if your solution is integrating or adding other features utilizing the COTS product, vendors must follow GPAT instructions and answer all 508 questions.

4.1

Completing the Section Tables

The section tables appearing after the summary table in the GPAT contain five columns. HRSA's 508 Program Office populates Columns One, Two and Three. The vendor is required to complete Columns Four and Five. The column definitions are: ˇ Column One (Provision Text) is the full text of the provision from the Standard.

1 | Page

Attachment B ˇ Column Two (Applicable) specifies "Yes" to indicate that the provision applies to the solicitation deliverables. Only the HRSA 508 Program Office can change the information in Column Two. Column Three (Notes) contains optional explanatory notes to help the vendor provide accessibility information and the agency determine applicability. Column Four (To what extent does the EIT meet this requirement?) provides a space for specifying whether your proposed solution is compliant, partially compliant, not compliant, or not applicable to the provision. Column Five (Technical Explanation) supplies the space to explain the answer you specified in Column Four according to the following expectations.

ˇ ˇ

ˇ

-

If your answer is "fully compliant," describe precisely how your deliverables support the provision. If your answer is "partially compliant," you must list exactly what features of the deliverables do meet and describe how they are used to support the provision. You must also list exactly what parts of the deliverables do not meet and describe how they fail to support the provision. In addition, for each provision that is partially compliant, for those that fail to meet the provision the vendor must have an equivalent method for the provision that makes the deliverable accessible. If your answer is "not compliant," specify the reasons your deliverable does not support the provision and whether you intend to incorporate support in future product releases. Remember that Section 508 allows deliverables to meet the Access Board Standards in innovative, nontraditional ways. The deliverable can meet the standard by providing an innovative solution, as long as the feature performs in the same manner as it does for any user without a disability. If your answer is "not applicable," explain why the provision does not apply to your proposal. For example, for client side image maps (Provision 1194.22 (f), you might say, "Our proposed website deliverable does not use image maps, but we will support and test this feature if it becomes applicable." Special Note for Column Five: In some cases, your deliverable may have extra functionality that the Government did not require or anticipate when preparing the GPAT. For example, your solution might include an instructional video with a training module that HRSA's 508 Program Office did not include as part of the GPAT. In this case, even though the video provision (1194.24) was not included in the original GPAT, you must explain how the solution meets Section 508 for each applicable provision in Column Five.

Completing the Summary Table

The summary table contains five columns. HRSA's 508 Program Office populates Columns One, Two and Three. You, the vendor, are required to complete Columns Four and Five. The column definitions are: ˇ Column One (CFR 1994 Standard Sections) names the 508 Section and states the total number of provisions it contains.

2 | Page

Attachment B ˇ Column Two (Total Number of Applicable Provisions) reports the number of section provisions applicable to your deliverable. For example, a section may contain 12 provisions, but only 10 may be related to this solicitation. Column Three (Notes) contains optional explanatory notes. Column Four (Provisions Supported by Category) provides sub-columns where you tally and categorize the total number of section provisions your solution supports as fully compliant, partially compliant, not compliant, or not applicable. Column Five (Explanation) provides a column where you are required to explain the answers you stated in Column Four. Special Note for Column Five: In some cases, your deliverable may have extra functionality that the Government did not require or anticipate when preparing the GPAT. For example, your solution might not include an instructional video with a training module that HRSA's 508 Program Office did not include as part of the GPAT. In this case, even though the video provision (1194.24) was not included in the original GPAT, you must explain how the solution meets Section 508 in Column Five.

Attachment A 1. Background The AIDS epidemic has taken an enormous toll since its onset in the early 1980s, and the epidemic has hit hardest among populations who are poor, lack health insurance, are disenfranchised from the health care system, and are from communities of color. In response, Congress enacted the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act in 1990 to improve the quality and availability of care for low-income, uninsured, and underinsured individuals and families affected by HIV disease. The CARE Act was amended and reauthorized in 1996, 2000, and 2006; in 2009 it was reauthorized as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 (Public Law 111­87). Administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB), the goal of Title XXVI of the PHS Act as amended by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 (Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program) is to improve the availability and quality of health care and supportive services for low income and medically underserved individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS. Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program services are intended to reduce the use of more costly inpatient care, increase access to care for underserved populations, and improve the quality of life for those affected by the epidemic. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program works towards these goals with states, highly-impacted metropolitan areas, and local community-based organizations in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other U.S. territories to provide services to people who do not have sufficient health care coverage or financial resources to cope with HIV disease. In 2011, 553,999 clients were served by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. For Program clients, the Program is the payer of last resort because they are uninsured or underinsured, and no other source of payment for services ­ public or private ­ is available. The majority of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds support primary medical care and essential support services. A smaller but equally critical portion is used to fund technical assistance to help funded programs address implementation and emerging HIV care issues, clinical training, and research on innovative models of care. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, first authorized in 1990, is currently funded at nearly $2.32 billion in fiscal year 2014. HRSA is responsible for supporting the implementation of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program through guidance, education, and technical assistance to Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees. Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program implementation requires collaboration with community groups representing underserved populations. The participation of these organizations is essential to developing programs that respond to the needs of the underserved. Effective participation, however, depends on an accurate and thorough understanding of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Programs, policies, priorities, and mandates. For more information about HRSA's HIV/AIDS Bureau or the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, please see the following resources: HIV/AIDS Bureau Website: www.hab.hrsa.gov State Profiles: www.hab.hrsa.gov/stateprofiles History Website: www.hab.hrsa.gov/livinghistory

Attachment A 2. Statement of Objectives 2.1. Overall Objectives The overall objective of this requirement is to obtain technical and professional services for an integrated marketing, education, and information dissemination campaign. This contract is an essential component of HRSA's statutory responsibility. To support this responsibility, the proposed solution shall assist HRSA/HAB in accomplishing the following goals: A. B. C. D. Strategically produce materials that enhance the ability of health care planners to implement responsive HIV care and treatment programs that reflect the needs of underserved populations and meet statutory requirements; Create a more informed and, therefore, better qualified community of providers and planners by identifying, researching, writing, developing and editing health communication materials and resources; Provide dissemination guidance for health communication materials, information, and technical assistance resources; and Develop tools and products to generate national awareness of critical Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program client-level data.

Targeted audiences of the information dissemination and marketing campaign include: ˇ Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees, providers, and planning bodies; ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ National, federal, and private-sector HIV/AIDS organizations and stakeholders; Clinicians across the country providing care and treatment to people living with HIV (PLWH); Clients who rely on the Program to get linked to care and treatment services, to remain in care, and ultimately to achieve viral load suppression; PLWH who are not yet receiving care but are eligible for services through Ryan White HIV/AIDS Programs located in metropolitan areas, states, and at local community-based organizations; and Congress and federal, state, and local agencies.

As part of this solution, a detailed Performance Work Statement (PWS) is required with performance measures tied to deliverables, realistic and achievable performance standards, and a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (inclusive of review process, products and integration of earned value management). 2.2. National Information Dissemination Campaign and Implementing Health Care Communications Programs: The proposed solution shall propose a strategic information dissemination campaign and implement health care communications program (known as the campaign) to best accomplish the main four objectives listed in Overall Objectives.

The proposed solution is encouraged to propose other strategies for marketing and information dissemination for this campaign. The three annual infographics will be used in the Social Media Outreach as well as other modalities of information dissemination. HRSA CareAction Newsletter: The only periodical created for the purpose of supporting implementation of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act. Its purpose is to transfer knowledge about underserved individuals, legislative mandates, and Federal program policies. The HRSA CareAction: ˇ ˇ ˇ facilitates collaboration among community organizations by improving understanding of emerging priorities and initiatives and changes in policy and programming; provides HRSA with an ongoing opportunity to inform partner agencies about the Agency's HIV/AIDSrelated activities - especially its technical assistance activities - and increase their knowledge about Ryan White HIV/AIDS Programs and the AIDS epidemic; and offers HRSA/HAB a clear picture of treatment developments, epidemiology, new approaches to service delivery, and emerging research in a concise and easily accessible format.

Printing and Duplicating: The printing of government documents must be accomplished through the Government Printing Office (GPO). Contractors and grantees shall not be used as sources of printing for the Department or OPDIVS. Therefore, the inclusion of printing in contracts and grants is prohibited unless authorized by the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP).

Ownership of Documents, Materials and Records: All documents, materials (including any computer code) or records provided to the Contractor, developed or maintained by the Contractor in the performance of this contract are deemed to be property of the Government. Limited Use of Data: Performance of this effort may require the Contractor to access and use data and information proprietary to a Government agency or Government Contractor which is of such a nature that its dissemination or use, other than in performance of this effort, would be adverse to the interests of the Government and/or others. Contractor and/or Contractor personnel shall not divulge or release data or information developed or obtained in performance of this effort, until made public by the Government, except to authorize Government personnel or upon written approval of the Contracting Officer (CO). The Contractor shall not use, disclose, or reproduce proprietary data that bears a restrictive legend, other than as required in the performance of this effort. Nothing herein shall preclude the use of any data independently acquired by the Contractor without such limitations or prohibit an agreement at no cost to the Government between the Contractor and the data owner which provides for greater rights to the Contractor. Disclosure of Information: Information made available to the Contractor by the Government for the performance or administration of this effort shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the written agreement of the Contracting Officer.

Attachment A The Contractor agrees to assume responsibility for protecting the confidentiality of Government records, which are not public information. Each Contractor or employee of the Contractor to whom information may be made available or disclosed shall be notified in writing by the Contractor that such information may be disclosed only for a purpose and to the extent authorized herein. Confidentiality Agreement Requirement: The Contractor shall implement a confidentiality agreement related to all data provided by the Government staff. All Contractor staff that work with the Federal Government and are provided information and access to databases shall sign such an agreement and a copy of the signed agreement for each relevant staff member shall be submitted to the COR prior to receipt of relevant documents. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12: To perform the work specified herein the Contractor personnel may require access to sensitive data, regular access to HHS-controlled facilities and/or access to HHS information systems, the Government may require that this effort entail a background investigation. ˇ Upon receipt of the Government's notification of applicable Suitability Background Investigation required, the Contractor shall complete and submit required forms within 30 days of the notification. Additional submission instructions can be found at the NCI Information Technology Security Policies, Background Investigation Process: (http://ais.nci.nih.gov/). ˇ The Contractor shall submit a roster, by name, position and responsibility, of all staff working under the contract. The roster shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR), with a copy to the HRSA Division of Workforce Management and Contracting Officer, within 14 days of the effective date of the contract. Any revisions to the roster as a result of staffing changes shall be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days of the change. The COR will submit the list to the HRSA Personnel Security Officer for determination of the appropriate level of suitability investigations to be performed. Contractors should ensure that the employees whose names they submit have a reasonable chance for approval. While delays in performance caused by successful investigations will be the Government's responsibility, delays associated with rejections will be the Contractor's responsibility. Typically, the Government conducts investigations and checks at no cost to the Contractor. Multiple investigations for the same position, whether- resulting from rejections or resulting from an employee's move to another position(s) or company, may at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reductions(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation.

In any event, the Government reserves the right to make an award to the best advantage of the Government, cost, and other factors considered. The following factors and criteria shall be used to evaluate offers: (A) GPAT Evaluation - (Pass/Fail) The HRSA 508 Program Office will evaluate the Offeror's completed GPAT to see if your proposed deliverables meet the Section 508 requirements. The Offeror's GPAT will be evaluated by on a Pass/Fail basis based on the evaluation criteria below.

Page 7 of 39

To receive a Pass, the HRSA 508 Program Office must find that your proposed deliverables meet (or exceed) the 508 requirements. The Offeror must satisfactorily answer all required items listed below (i.e., vendor must satisfactorily answer all items listed under Fully Compliant, Partially Compliant, Not Compliant, and Not Applicable in its completed GPAT). If a single item is not satisfactorily and completely answered (following the descriptions below for Fully Compliant, Partially Compliant, Not Compliant and Not Applicable) under each evaluation requirement, the Offeror will fail. The Offerors that receive a failing GPAT evaluation will not remain in the competition for award. In order to "Pass", all of the following must be satisfactorily addressed: Fully Compliant: ˇ For each provision that the Offeror self-rates as being fully compliant, the Offeror must provide a technical explanation listing exactly what features of the deliverables meet the provision and describe how the features are used to support the provision. Partially Compliant: If a provision is marked partially compliant, the Offeror is required to list all three explanations to pass. ˇ For each provision that the Offeror self-rates as being partially compliant, the Offeror must provide a technical explanation listing exactly what features of the deliverables do meet the provision and describing how they are used to support the provision; ˇ For each provision that the Offeror self-rates as being partially compliant, the Offeror must provide a technical explanation listing exactly what parts of the deliverables do not meet the provision and describe how they fail to support the provision; and ˇ For each provision that the Offeror self-rates as being partially compliant, the Offer must explain its equivalent method that makes the deliverable accessible. Not Compliant: ˇ For each provision that the Offeror self-rates as not compliant, the Offeror must describe how the deliverable does not support the provision. ˇ For each provision that the Offeror self-rates as being not compliant or failing to meet the provision, an equivalent method that makes the deliverable accessible must be provided. Not Applicable: ˇ For each provision that is not applicable, the Offeror must provide an explanation as to why the requirement is not applicable. List exactly why the provision is not applicable to the deliverable. For example, for client side image maps (Provision 1194.22 (f), the Offeror may list, "Our proposed website deliverable will not use image maps, but we will support and test this feature if it becomes applicable." (B) Technical Understanding and Approach ­ 65 Points The Offeror's quotation shall: 1. Demonstrate a clear understanding of the scope and requirements of the project, in the Offeror's own words.

Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (inclusive of objective and subjective standards, proposed performance evaluation standards, review process, products, and integration of Earned Value Management in a report format). This factor, Technical Understanding and Approach, will be evaluated based on the extent to which the Offeror will meet or exceed contract objectives. Effectiveness in the Offeror's approach to activities, using current industry trends in public health and communications, appropriateness and timeliness of materials and topic matters to target audiences and to the health care environment, and cost efficiency of resources are part of this evaluation criteria. More than one method or approach may be proposed along with enumeration of the respective advantages and disadvantages of each. Technical Understanding and Approach shall be evaluated on the extent to which they demonstrate the Offeror's ability to complete high quality work in a relatively short period of time. This factor shall also be evaluated on the extent to which is demonstrates a clear understanding of the scope and requirements of the project, in the Offeror's own words. (D) Personnel ­ 15 Points The Offeror shall specify the types of personnel (in terms or education and professional experience) to be employed to perform the tasks and document specifically how their backgrounds contribute to meeting the needs of this RFQ.

(F) Past Performance ­ 5 Points and not to exceed 5 pages (exclusive of references) HRSA is seeking to determine whether the Offeror has recent and relevant experience that that would indicate their technical capacity to perform the services described in this solicitation and whether the Offeror consistently delivers quality services in a timely and cost effective manner. In evaluating past performance, HRSA will take into consideration the relevant experience and past performance assessments from the Offeror's customers. HRSA reserves the right to use other relevant past performance information that it obtains through government-wide past performance information systems, trade literature and the knowledge of HRSA personnel. Offerors are requested to provide three references for similar work efforts that were performed during the last three years. Each reference should include a description of the project; project title; contract number; contract amount; and client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official names(s), address and telephone number. Evaluations may include interviews with previous clients of the prime contractor and subcontractors. In case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer or part of an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice f withdrawal is received before award.

Page 20 of 39

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(t) System for Award Management (SAM). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Offeror is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Offeror is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Offeror has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Offeror shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Offeror must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Offeror fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Offeror to be other than the Offeror indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Offeror shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Offeror's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Offeror will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. (u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Offeror or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an AntiDeficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.

Page 31 of 39

(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
