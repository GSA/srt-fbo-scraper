SECTION C DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT

STATEMENT OF WORK HIT 10 ­ Query and Retrieve Test Tool Health IT Standards and Test Methods - Update of NIST Query and Retrieve Test Tool and Integration into Testing Environment BACKGROUND The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 emphasizes the need for the U.S. to move toward electronic health records. The legislation calls out the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), in part, to establish a Health Information Technology Testing Infrastructure Project (HITTIP) that supports effective industry consensus standards development processes and provides the U.S. healthcare IT industry and federal activities with robust conformance and interoperability testing capabilities. NIST will be responsible for leading the development of the core HITTIP that will provide a scalable, multi-partner, automated, remote capability for current and future testing needs. An initial emphasis will be on testing the standards addressing high national healthcare priorities (e.g., as identified and/or defined in concept of Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology "meaningful use"). As part of this effort, NIST will help further the development of the Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS) Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) by adapting specific NIST conformance test tools that are suitable for integration into the NHIN testing environment hosted by DHHS. SCOPE The objective of this contract is to support NIST in adapting the NIST conformance test tool for document query and retrieve responses into the NHIN testing environment hosted by DHHS. In support of this contract, the Contractor shall adapt the NIST Query and Retrieve Test Tool (found at http://ihexds.nist.gov) to meet the conformance requirements found in: http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_11673_910546_0_0_18/NHIN_QueryforDocumentsProduct ionSpecification_v2.0.pdf and http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_11673_910547_0_0_18/NHIN_RetrieveDocumentsProducti onSpecification_v2.0.pdf , and shall adapt the Test Tool such that it can be integrated into the NHIN architecture and test environment hosted by DHHS described in: http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=1486&parentname=CommunityPage&parentid=46&mode=2& in_hi_userid=11113&cached=true ; and http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_11113_911644_0_0_18/NHIN_InterimValidationPlan_v1_1 _Approved_2010Apr15.pdf ; and assist NIST with the integration. CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS The contractor shall have expertise in software development projects that focus on applying additional requirements into an existing code base and integrating an existing code base into a new software environment. The contractor shall have awareness of the NHIN and the NHIN specifications (located at http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=1407&parentname=CommunityPage&parentid=8&mode=2&i n_hi_userid=11113&cached=true). The contractor shall have awareness of the NHIN Patient Discovery Web Service Interface Specification and industry specifications referenced within. SPECIFIC TASKS 1.

SECTION L INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS (d) "Offer expiration date." Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) "Restriction on disclosure and use of data." Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall-(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed-in whole or in part-for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in connection with-the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) "Contract award." (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (f) (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: SB1341-10-RP-0066 Page - 40

(b) The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the "Common Rule"), adopted by the Department of Commerce at 15 CFR Part 27, requires contractors to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for the protection of human subjects in research. The Common Rule defines a "human subject" as a living individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or identifiable private information. The term "research" means a systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. The Common Rule also sets forth categories of research that may be considered exempt from 15 CFR Part 27. These categories may be found at 15 CFR 27.101(b).

SECTION L INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS (2) Documentation to verify that the cognizant IRB possesses a valid registration with the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Human Research Protections ("OHRP"); (3) Documentation to verify that contractor has a valid Federal-wide Assurance (FWA) issued by OHRP. (e) Prior to starting any research involving human subjects, the contractor shall submit appropriate documentation to the Contracting Officer for institutional review and approval. This documentation may include: (1) Copies of the human subjects research protocol, all questionnaires, surveys, advertisements, and informed consent forms approved by the cognizant IRB; (2) Documentation of approval for the human subjects research protocol, questionnaires, surveys, advertisements, and informed consent forms by the cognizant IRB; (3) Documentation of continuing IRB approval by the cognizant IRB at appropriate intervals as designated by the IRB, but not less than annually; and/or (4) Documentation to support an exemption for the project from the Common Rule [NOTE: this option is not available for activities that fall under 45 CFR Part 46 Subpart C]. (f) In addition, if the contractor modifies a human subjects research protocol, questionnaire, survey, advertisement, or informed consent form approved by the cognizant IRB, the contractor shall submit a copy of all modified material along with documentation of approval for said modification by the cognizant IRB to the Contracting Officer for institutional review and approval. The contractor shall not implement any IRB approved-modification without written approval by the Contracting Officer. (g) No work involving human subjects may be undertaken, conducted, or costs incurred and/or charged to the project, until the Contracting Officer approves the required appropriate documentation in writing. (End of provision) L.11 52.237-10 IDENTIFICATION OF UNCOMPENSATED OVERTIME (OCT 1997) (a) "Definitions." As used in this provision-"Uncompensated overtime" means the hours worked without additional compensation in excess of an average of 40 hours per week by direct charge employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. Compensated personal absences such as holidays, vacations, and sick leave shall be included in the normal work week for purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours. "Uncompensated overtime rate" is the rate that results from multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the proposed hours per week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20 per hour would be converted to an uncompensated overtime rate of $17.78 per hour ($20.00 x 40 divided by 45=$17.78). (b) For any proposed hours against which an uncompensated overtime rate is applied, the offeror shall identify in its proposal the hours in excess of an average of 40 hours per week, by labor category at the same level of detail as compensated hours, and the uncompensated overtime rate per hour, whether at the prime or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct. (c) The offeror's accounting practices used to estimate uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost accounting practices used to accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours. (d) Proposals that include unrealistically low labor rates, or that do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism, will be considered in a risk assessment and will be evaluated for award in accordance with that assessment. (e) The offeror shall include a copy of its policy addressing uncompensated overtime with its proposal. (End of Provision) SB1341-10-RP-0066 Page - 46

M.1 1352.215-74 BEST VALUE EVALUATION

(APR 2010)

(a) Award will be made to the offeror: whose offer conforms to the solicitation requirements; who is determined responsible in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.1 by possessing the financial and other capabilities to fulfill the requirements of the contract; and whose proposal is judged, by an integrated assessment of price/cost and non-price evaluation factors, to provide the best value to the Government in accordance with CAR 1352.215-75, Evaluation Criteria. (b) The Government intends to award FIRM-FIXED PRICE CONTRACT in response to the solicitation. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract depending on the quality of the proposals submitted and the availability of funds. (c) Evaluation of Proposals (1) Initial Evaluation of Proposals. All offers received will be evaluated in accordance with the stated evaluation factors. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions based solely upon initial proposals. Therefore, offerors should ensure that their initial proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed. If award is not made upon initial proposals, then the Contracting Officer will establish a competitive range comprised of the most highly rated proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly- rated proposals. Only those offerors in the competitive range will be offered an opportunity to participate further in the procurement. (2) Discussions/Final Proposal Revisions. The Contracting Officer will engage in discussions with all offerors in the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306. At the conclusion of discussions, a final common cut-off date for submission of final proposal revisions will be established. Those offerors remaining in the competitive range will be notified to submit Final Proposal Revisions. (3) Final Evaluation of Offers. A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revisions. (End of clause) M.1 1352.215-74 BEST VALUE EVALUATION (APR 2010)

A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revisions. (End of clause) M.2 1352.215-75 EVALUATION CRITERIA (APR 2010) In determining which proposal provides the best value to the Government, nonprice (Technical, Key Personnel, Past Performance) evaluation factors are significantly MORE IMPORTANT than evaluated price. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the relative strengths, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and risks of each Offeror's proposal in accordance with the evaluation factors below. The proposals will be evaluated using information submitted by each Offeror on the four factors below, which are listed in descending order of importance. They are: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Technical Approach Key Personnel Past Peformance Cost/Price

All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that Offeror whose proposals provides the best overall value to the Government. Based upon the results of the integrated assessment of the technical and cost/price proposals, the Government may make an award to other than the lowestpriced offeror or the offeror with the highest technical score if the source selection official determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government. EVALUATION FACTORS (a) Technical Evaluation Factors Factor 1 - TECHNICAL APPROACH. The proposal will be evaluated on how the offeror intends to organize, staff and manage the contract and the means that will be used to accomplish the contract requirements. The degree to which the proposal demonstrates an understanding of the requirements will be evaluated, as well as the offeror's planned management of consultants and subcontractors, if applicable. Proposals which simply give back or repeat the provided requirements SB1341-10-RP-0066 Page - 49

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD will not be considered as this demonstrates the required capabilites are not fully understood or assimilated. Factor 2 - KEY PERSONNEL. The education, experience, and accomplishments of key personnel will be evaluated to determine the degree to which they possess the qualifications to perform their proposed duties under the contract. Factor 3 - PAST PERFORMANCE. The offeror's past performance on related contracts will be evaluated to determine, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, effective management of subcontractors, cost management, level of communication between the contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction. The Government will evaluate the quality and relevance of past performance information for the Offeror in performing contracts that are similar to the scope of this acquisition that were completed within the past three (3) years or are currently being performed. The Government may utilize references provided by the Offeror and any other references or sources of information for this purposes. In the event that the Offeror does not have relevant past performance information, the Offeror would receive a neutral rating for this factor. The Government reserves the right to assess the past performance of proposed subcontractors. The Government will use its discretion to determine the sources of past performance information used in the evaluation, and the information may be obtained from references provided by the offeror, the agency's knowledge of contractor performance, other government agencies or commercial entities, or past performance databases. Factor 4 ­ PRICE/COST. The proposed prices/costs will be evaluated but not scored. The cost evaluation will determine whether the proposed costs are realistic, complete, and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. Proposed costs must be entirely compatible with the technical proposal. The Government may use the results of cost/price realism analysis to adjust the offeror's proposal to a most probable cost to the Government. The analysis may include information from a government auditing agency, Government technical personnel, and other sources.
