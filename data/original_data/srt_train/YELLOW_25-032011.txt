Federal Bureau of Investigation Request for Information (RFI) #25-032011 March 4, 2011 SUMMARY This Request for Information (RFI) is in support of market research for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for the outsourcing of an Unclassified Network (UNet) server and storage infrastructure and applications layer environment, less certain operations and security monitoring functions, as well as to add additional infrastructure services to that outsourced environment (UNet Outsourcing). PURPOSE This RFI requests vendors to provide information to assist the Government in data collection pursuant to a bundle of services as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) from a commercial provider(s) of cloud computing services and software. Cloud computing will encompass all support services required to design the full requested capability, transition existing services, deploy and operate new services, and safeguard all inscope services. The business objectives are to replace current on-premise sensitiveÂ­but-unclassified (SBU) unified communication, collaboration and application hosting services with a dedicated cloud solution, as well as add the services described in detail below. Please note the FBI intends to continue to operate its UNet desktop and mobile computing environment including performing associated software deployment and security patch management, to operate the associated UNet switching and transmission network, and to conduct operational performance and security monitoring; therefore, these capabilities are deliberately excluded from this RFI. The ideal solution would be an integrated tool set through which the Government monitors performance metrics and permits the Government to administer through business rules and roles, rather than physical control of its own hardware assets and direct software licensing. This RFI is for planning and informational purposes only and shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. Vendors that do not possess an active Top Secret Facility Clearance need not respond. This RFI is part of the FBI's effort to distinguish and appraise the business community's aptitude to provide such services associated with the UNet Outsourcing. This RFI will also ask responders for their feedback to a series of questions and the RFI. BACKGROUND The Information and Technology Branch (ITB), within the FBI, has the responsibility and duty to direct, engineer, and operate all network infrastructures including UNet. So as to enhance the service provided to all users, ITB has acknowledged the need to implement the Next Generation UNet (NGU). NGU will 1

meet existing demands, accommodate future growth, address and mitigate existing vulnerabilities and provide an optimal infrastructure that can better support expanding user needs. The existing UNet e-mail and collaboration infrastructure at the FBI is not sufficient for the future. The environment is comprised of aging servers and network devices with limited redundancy and inconsistent support capability. The current email and collaboration software infrastructure supporting the FBI is based on: Microsoft Exchange 2007 for E-mail Microsoft SharePoint 2007 for File Sharing Blackberry Enterprise Server (version 4.1.7) Big Fix for Desktop Client Management Microsoft Windows Server 2008 VMware ESX Server 3.5 Virtualization The current environment and future outsourced environment will be managed by the FBI's use of: ArcSight security monitoring products HP Enterprise Management Suite (EMS) operational monitoring products
