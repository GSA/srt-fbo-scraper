STATEMENT OF WORK FOR

INSTALLATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF LAKESIDE SYSTRAK 6.1 SOFTWARE OR EQUIVALENT SOFTWARE

Prepared by NATIONAL AIR AND SPACE INTELLIGENCE CENTER

1. SCOPE 1.1 NASIC/GSI is investigating the possibility of deploying virtual PCs and workstations as part of a larger infrastructure virtualization research effort. In order to determine the requirements needed in the datacenter, NASIC needs to understand the workload being supported by NASIC's existing PC/workstation infrastructure. NASIC plans to measure this workload directly by deploying Lakeside Systrak 6.1 software, or equivalent software, on all of NASIC's SIPRNet PCs/workstations. NASIC will perform/oversee the installation of the software and subsequent analysis of the resulting data. NASIC will require special contractor support to determine the assets required to support NASIC/GSIs PC-based workload using datacenter based hardware and PC over IP (PCoIP) Zero clients. 2. REQUIREMENT FOR INSTALLATION AND DEPLOYMENT 2.1 Send a TS/SCI cleared contractor specialist to install Lakeside Systrak 6.1 software or equivalent software on NASIC/GSI SIPRNet and JWICS PCs and workstations. This is to be coordinated with NASIC/SC personnel using a contractor owned and loaded licensed copy of Lakeside Systrak 6.1 software or a software that is an equivalent. 2.2 Run the Lakeside Systrak 6.1 software, or an equivalent software, to monitor the CPU, local disk, network and application usage for each PC/workstation for a period of at least 30 days. No on-site contractor asset required for this phase. 2.3 Send a TS/SCI cleared contractor specialist to collect the data gathered over the 30+ day period and evaluate that data to determine: 2.3.1 2.3.2 2.3.3 The number of PCs that can be supported using a PCoIP architecture, Identifying the PC/workstations that cannot be supported using a PCoIP architecture, and Determine requirements for hardware, software, storage and network changes required to implement a PCoIP VDI architecture in NASIC/GSI (complying with NASIC approved architecture/contractor as much as possible). Initially on the SIPRNet network, starting with five (5) selected workstations, then including the entire SIPRNet infrastructure in NASIC/GSI determined to be suitable for PCoIP support.

2.4 The government will provide access to NASIC/SC personnel, adequate infrastructure to deploy the Systrak software, or equivalent software, space to collect, store and analyze the collected data and PC access at the appropriate level needed to perform the analysis.

2.5 Document and deliver to the government all data, results, analysis and recommendations on both hardcopy (2 copies) and disk based media. All of this data will be created here at NASIC. 2.6 Coordinate with NASIC/SC or provide instructions to remove monitoring software from NASIC/GSI workstations if the decision is made NOT to continue with the PCoIP architecture concept. 2.7 The work will require a TS/SCI cleared contractor specialist. The government will not establish a SIPRNet account for the contractor nor sponsor any requests for clearances. 2.8 The vendor will perform all work under the supervision of a NASIC/SC or NASIC/GSI approved systems administrator. 2.9 A DD254 is not required for this effort.
