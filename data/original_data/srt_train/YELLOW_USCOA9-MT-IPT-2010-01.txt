SECTION C - SPECIFICATIONS / STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1 (a)

BACKGROUND The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the Court) has a requirement for the purchase, implementation, and warranty maintenance of a new Avaya IP Telephony (IPT) voice communication system to support the Court's requirements in the Old Chamber Building - Billings. This Request for Proposal (RFP) is for a complete turn-key IPT solution. The Wide Area Network (WAN) for the Federal Judiciary is provided and managed by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (the AO) in Washington, D.C. This network, referred to as the Judiciary Data Communication Network (DCN), uses Sprint's Peerless IP (PIP) network with Multi-Link Point to Point Protocol (MLPPP). The MPLS network supports full Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities. The Federal Judiciary is implementing a new IP Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network to interconnect all Court locations nation-wide. This network will have Class of Service (CoS) tagging enabled to support QoS for Voice over IP (VoIP). The Court also has optional requirements for IP Trunking with the existing Avaya IPT systems in the San Francisco, Seattle, Pasadena, and Portland Courthouses. The optional IP trunking shall be provided using VoIP networking over the Federal Judiciary's DCN / WAN. The existing Avaya Communication Manager in the San Francisco Courthouse has S8720 Media Servers in a fully redundant configuration with G650 Media Gateways. The existing DID telephone numbers for this system are: 415-335-7800 thru 415-335-8299, and 415-355-8500 thru 415-355-8999. This system has a 5-digit dial plan. Configuration information for this existing Avaya IPT system is provided in Attachment A of this solicitation. In the San Francisco Courthouse, the Court's LAN is connected to a Cisco 3845 router that is managed by the AO for access to the Federal Judiciary DCN via a DS3, 22 Mbps connection. The existing Avaya Communication Manager in the Seattle Courthouse has S8730 Media Servers in a fully redundant configuration with G650 Media Gateways. The existing DID telephone numbers for this system are: 206-224-2130 thru 206-224-2429, and 206-2241500 thru 206-224-1509. This system has a 4-digit dial plan. Configuration information for this existing Avaya IPT system is provided in Attachment B of this solicitation. The existing Avaya Communication Manager in the Seattle Courthouse has IP trunking with another Avaya Communication Manager operated by the US District Court for the Western District of Washington at 700 Stewart Street in Seattle, Washington (District Page 5

The existing DID telephone numbers for the District Courthouse are: 206370-5200 thru 206-370-5399 and 206-370-8400 thru 206-370-8999, plus 206-553-1340, 1344, 1347, 1363, 1383, 1404, 1650, 1652, 1654, and 1655. The IP trunking arrangement allows 4-digit dialing between the Circuit Court's Seattle Courthouse and the District Courthouse via the Federal Judiciary DCN / WAN. It also has Alternate Route Selection (ARS) configured so that 4-digit dialed calls can be routed via the PSTN in case the DCN / WAN connection is not available. (h) In the Seattle Courthouse, the Court's LAN is connected to a Cisco 2821 router that is managed by the AO for access to the Federal Judiciary DCN via two T1 circuits, 3 Mbps connection. The existing Avaya Communication Manager in the Pasadena Courthouse has S8720 Media Servers in a fully redundant configuration with G650 Media Gateways. The existing DID telephone numbers for this system are: 626-229-7100 thru 626-229-7499 and 626-535-2960 thru 626-535-2999. This system has a 4-digit dial plan. Configuration information for this existing Avaya IPT system is provided in Attachment C of this solicitation. In the Pasadena Courthouse, the Court's LAN is connected to a Cisco 3845 router that is managed by the AO for access to the Federal Judiciary DCN via a DS3 High Speed Serial Interface (HSSI), 12 Mbps connection. The existing Avaya Communication Manager in the Portland Courthouse has an S8500 Media Server with G650 Media Gateways. The existing DID telephone numbers for this system are: 503-721-3480 thru 503-721-3499, 503-833-5300 thru 503-833-5399, and 503-833-5750 thru 503-833-5769. This system has a 4-digit dial plan. Configuration information for this existing Avaya IPT system is provided in Attachment D of this solicitation. In the Portland Courthouse, the Court's LAN is connected to a Cisco 2821 router that is managed by the AO for access to the Federal Judiciary DCN via one T1, 1.5 Mbps connection. The company responding to this solicitation (the Offeror) shall agree to furnish the proposed products and services that are called for in strict accordance with the conditions, requirements and specifications of this solicitation and in the Offeror's proposal. The successful Offeror shall become the contractor for the IPT system project (the contractor).

C.2

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

C.2.1 Old Chamber Building - Billings (a) The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has a single Judge's chambers and one Circuit Librarian in the Old Chamber Building - Billings. The Court occupies leased space on the second floor of this three story commercial office building. Several other tenants occupy space in this building. The Court is currently served by an existing Norstar telephone system with a StarTalk voice mail system. The building telecommunication service entry, demarcation (demarc) for telephone services is located in the second floor phone closet. The Court's existing Norstar telephone and voice messaging systems, and the Court's Main Distribution Frame (MDF) are located in the Court's server Equipment Room (server ER) in the Judge's chamber. The Court's new IPT system common equipment shall be located in the Court's server ER with the Court's servers and data Local Area Network (LAN) switch. This room has supplemental cooling. Space and power outlets for the new IPT system will be provided by the Court as required for the selected system. The existing telephone station cabling is Category 3 terminated on 66-type connecting blocks in the server ER and on 6-pin RJ11 jacks in the work areas. The existing data station cabling is Category 5 terminated on patch panels in the server ER and on 8-pin RJ45 jacks in the work areas. The Court's LAN has one Cisco WS-C2960-24TC-L switch in the server ER. This switch does not have Power over Ethernet (PoE) and will not be used to serve the new IP telephone instruments. The Court is in the process of having the server ER reconfigured to provide additional space for the new IPT system. New Category 6 station cables for telephone and data will be provided from the server ER to all work areas.

"Principals," for the purposes of this certification, means officers; directors; owners; partners; and, persons having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and similar positions).

The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. Nothing contained in the foregoing will be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the judiciary, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

However, if a party files a formal protest with an external forum on a solicitation on which it has filed a protest with the judiciary, the Judiciary protest will be dismissed. Judiciary protests will be considered only if submitted in accordance with the following time limits and procedures: (1) any protest shall be filed in writing with the CO designated in the solicitation for resolution of the protest. It shall identify the solicitation or contract protested and set forth a complete statement of the alleged defects or grounds that make the solicitation terms or the award or proposed award defective. Mere statement of intent to file a protest is not a protest. a protest shall be filed not later than ten (10) calendar days after the basis of the protest is known, or should have been known. A protest based on alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to the closing date for receipt of offers, shall be filed prior to the closing date for receipt of offers. The judiciary, in its discretion, may consider the merits of any protest which is not timely filed. The office hours of the Administrative Office are 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., eastern time. Time for filing a document expires at 5:00 p.m., eastern time, on the last day on which such filing may be made. the protest shall include the following information: (i) name, address, and fax and telephone numbers of the protester or its representative; (ii) solicitation or contract number; (iii) detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, to include a description of resulting alleged prejudice to the protester; (iv) copies of relevant documents; (v) request for a ruling by the judiciary; (vi) statement as to the form of relief requested; (vii) all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protest; and (viii) all information establishing the timeliness of the protest.

L.11.3 Volume I, Part 3: Pricing Forms (a) The Offeror shall incorporate the complete Section B of this solicitation document and shall agree to comply with these provisions. Offerors are required to complete the pricing table in section B.2 and provide separate pricing forms for each line item on that table. The pricing forms may be submitted in the Offeror's own format but shall include all information specified herein. Implementation costs for all equipment and software, including all necessary labor and materials, for the fully operational systems specified herein, are the responsibility of the contractor. The Offeror is required to include all applicable costs for the implementation specified herein in the pricing forms. The contractor is responsible for complete implementation of fully operational systems specified herein at the price proposed in the pricing forms. If there are additional costs for the specified implementation, above what was proposed in the pricing forms, the contractor shall be responsible for those costs. The Court will not pay additional costs for the implementation to be performed as specified herein. The Pricing Forms shall include, but not be limited to, all equipment, services, accessories, cables, connectors, and other related items for fully installed systems ready for operation by the Court as specified in Section C. Any material, equipment, or information specified in the contractor's proposal which is necessary for complete and operational systems for which a price is not specifically identified by the Offeror shall be considered to be included in the price of another item or provided at no cost to the government unless otherwise provided in this contract. The Offeror shall list all equipment and software to be provided for each item with the functional requirement shown on the pricing forms. The Model/Part Number, Equipment/Software Description, Quantity, Unit Price, Purchase Price, Unit Implement Price and Total Implement Price for each item shall be provided by the Offeror. The Purchase Price for each item shall equal the Unit Price multiplied by the Quantity for that item. The Court understands that some manufacturers offer "packages" that include equipment and software items, such as trunk and line modules, in the base price. Equipment and software items that are included in packages should be listed in the pricing forms with the word "included" in the price columns. For example, if two analog line modules are Page 60

(g) The Offeror shall provide unit implementation prices so that the Court can determine what it would cost to add or delete items for the final contract. The unit implementation price for each item shall include all necessary labor for configuring, programming, and physically installing that item. The Total Implement Price for each item shall equal the Unit Implement Price multiplied by the Quantity for that item. The Total Purchase Price and Total Implement Price shall be shown separately and added together on the final page of each Pricing Form. Where quantities change, the total prices will be adjusted based upon the changed quantities using the proposed unit prices on the pricing forms. The adjusted Purchase Price for each item shall equal the Unit Price multiplied by the adjusted Quantity for that item. The adjusted Total Implement Price for each item shall equal the Unit Implement Price multiplied by the adjusted Quantity for that item. Where offeror's do not provide the Unit Implement Price for an item, the Total Implement Price will not be adjusted if the quantities for that item are changed. VOLUME II: TECHNICAL RESPONSE

M.2

EVALUATION OF INITIAL PROPOSALS

The Court reserves the right to award the contract based on the initial proposal submission, without discussions or negotiations of such proposals. Therefore, it is important that each proposal be fully compliant, without exception to any requirement, clause or provision. Offerors should submit initial proposals which respond most favorably to the Court's requirements. M.3 (a) EVALUATION ­ GENERAL This procurement is being conducted using formal source selection procedures, and contract award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, and is determined to be most advantageous to the judiciary, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the requirements stated below. The evaluation will be conducted using the evaluation criteria set forth in this section. The judiciary reserves the right to determine the specific order and duration of individual activities as the evaluation proceeds, or call for discussions, proposal clarifications, or revisions at any time as may be determined to be in the Court's best interest. Each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. Proposal clarification/revision requests may be issued which encompass any and all written documentation submitted in response to the solicitation as may be deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, to fully explore and evaluate the merits of proposals submitted. The Court reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later

SOLICITATION NUMBER: USCOA9-MT- IPT-2010.01  determined to be necessary, with Offerors making the competitive range (i.e., the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for the purposes of efficiency). (c) Offerors are hereby notified that the Court may utilize a private consultant to assist in the evaluation of proposals. The consultant will have access to any and all information contained in an Offeror's proposal and will be subject to the appropriate conflict of interest, standards of conduct, and confidentiality restrictions. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Court to exercise the options. Proposals containing any charges for failure to exercise any option will be rejected. Offerors are placed on notice that any proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unreasonably high or low in cost or price may be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements and may be grounds for the rejection of the Offeror's proposal. EVALUATION PROCESS

(d)

(e)

M.4

Each proposal will be initially evaluated for: (1) responsiveness to the solicitation, agreed upon terms and conditions, and (2) the ability to satisfy the requirements of the solicitation. The Court reserves the right to consider as acceptable only those proposals that are submitted in accordance with all requirements set forth or referenced in this solicitation. Offerors shall demonstrate an understanding of all requirements and a capability to provide the required facilities, services, and items. The Court reserves the right to reject proposals that do not address the totality of the solicitation requirements, including the contract terms and conditions. Only those proposals considered responsive to the solicitation requirements and terms and conditions will be evaluated further for technical acceptability, technical excellence, management and business risk, and price reasonableness. M.5 (a) RESPONSIVENESS AND COMPLIANCE The Court will evaluate each Offeror's Volume I, Business Response. To be considered responsive, the Offeror must: (1) Complete blocks 12 through 16 of Standard Form 33 (Section A, Cover Page) and have blocks 17 and 18 signed and dated by a representative authorized to commit Offeror to contractual obligations in accordance with Section L.11.1; (2) Complete all blocks in Paragraphs F.2, G.5, and H.2 and include the full paragraphs in the proposal in accordance with Section L.11.2(a); (3) Complete all applicable boxes or blocks in Section K, and include the full section in the proposal in accordance with Section L.11.2(b); (4) Provide a statement of understanding, agreement, and compliance with the solicitation paragraphs specified in Section L.11.2(c); (5) Complete the Pricing Forms listed in Section B, in accordance with the instructions contained in Section L.11.3.

(b)

Any Offeror failing to comply with all of the requirements and specifications of these Sections and Paragraphs (including associated subparagraphs) may be deemed unresponsive and/or non-compliant, and may be dropped from further consideration for contract award. TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE AND MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS RISK The Technical Excellence and Management and Business Risk factors of each Offeror's proposal will be evaluated to determine which proposal offers the best technical and management value to the Court. The following evaluation factors are of equal importance. For each factor, the evaluation will consist of an assessment of the degree to which the facilities and services offered in the proposal provide added value, added capability, and/or reduced risk. (1) Factor 1: Technical Excellence ­ System Proposed. The Court will evaluate each Offeror's responses to the technical requirements of the following paragraphs and associated subparagraphs: C.3, C.4, and C.5. The Court will also evaluate the Schematic Diagram, and Technical Documentation submitted by the Offeror. This evaluation will be based on the Offeror's responses in accordance with the instructions contained in Sections L.12.1(a), L.12.1(b), and L.12.1(c). Factor 2: Technical Excellence ­ Implementation and Services Proposed. The Court will evaluate each Offeror's responses to the technical requirements of the following paragraphs and associated subparagraphs: C.6, C.7, C.8, C.9, E.2, and E.3. This evaluation will be based on the Offeror's responses in accordance with the instructions contained in Sections L.12.1(d). Factor 3: Management and Business Risk. The Court will evaluate the Offeror's response to Section L.12.2. The Court will evaluate contractor and key personnel qualifications for implementation and maintenance support to be in compliance with the requirements of Section H.3 and H.4. The Court will evaluate the contractor experience and past performance based upon the contractor's references. The Court may contact references to determine recent customer satisfaction with the Offeror and the systems and services provided under their contract. The Court will consider the number of references provided by each Offeror. The amount of past performance will be considered as a risk factor in the evaluation and decision-making process, with less past performance considered a higher risk to the Court. While the Court may elect to consider information from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.

M.6 (a)

(b)

(2)

(3)

(c)

The evaluation assessment of Factors 1, 2, and 3, will be depicted by narrative and an overall score for each Offeror's proposal based on the following:

United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

Page 66 

SOLICITATION NUMBER: USCOA9-MT- IPT-2010.01  Excellent Very Good Acceptable Marginal Poor Enhanced value and/or capability that is of significant benefit to the judiciary and/or is of very low risk High value and/or capability that is of benefit to the judiciary and/or is of low risk Satisfactory value and/or capability to the judiciary and/or is of moderate risk Marginal value and/or capability to the judiciary and/or is of high risk Reduced value and/or capability to the judiciary and/or is of unacceptably high risk

(d)

Technical Excellence and Management and Business Risk will be evaluated to determine the Offeror's capability to perform the requirements of this solicitation. As part of this assessment, the Court will consider the Offeror's abilities for successful performance of the contract, abilities to meet contractual schedules within proposed prices, abilities to fulfill and deliver customer requirements, the actual performance of systems and services provided, and the level of customer satisfaction. Evaluation of Information from Other Sources: The Court reserves the right to utilize all information available at the time of evaluations. The Court may rely on information made available through reference checks, information available through commercial sources (such as Dunn and Bradstreet reports), and information publicly available (such as articles contained in periodicals). If information obtained through sources outside of the Offeror substantially disagrees with the Offeror's response, the Offeror will be given an opportunity to address the inconsistencies during discussions and negotiations. Recent and current customers of the Offeror may be contacted to determine satisfaction with the Offeror's capabilities and performance. PRICE EVALUATION

(e)

M.7

Offerors' proposed prices from the Pricing Forms in Section B will be evaluated for reasonableness. Proposals containing unrealistic prices will not be considered for award. M.8 (a) (b) CONTRACT AWARD The Court intends to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation. Contract award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose proposal represents the best overall value to the Court, given the outcome of the Court's evaluation of each Offeror's technical excellence and management and business risk factors and proposed price. In selecting the best overall value, the Court will consider the quality offered for the evaluated price. The relative quality of offers will be based upon the Court's assessment of the tradeoffs between the technical excellence offered in the Offeror's proposal and whether it provides added value, added capability, and/or reduced management and business risk. Page 67 

United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

SOLICITATION NUMBER: USCOA9-MT- IPT-2010.01 

(c)

Technical excellence and management and business risk factors are considered to be more important than price. Although price/cost is considered secondary, it will be a significant criterion for award as part of an integrated assessment with the technical excellence and management and business risk factors. The importance of price will increase as the technical and management merits of the Offerors' proposals become more equal. Among proposals that are substantially equal in technical and management merit, price may become the determinative factor for award. The proposal offering the Court the "best value" with technical excellence, management and business risk, and price factors considered, will be recommended for contract award. The contract may be awarded to other than the Offeror with the lowest price or the highest technical and management rating. The Court reserves the right to make no award pursuant to this solicitation.
