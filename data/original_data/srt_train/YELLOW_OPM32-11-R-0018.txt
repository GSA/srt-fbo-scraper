RFP: OPM32-11-R-0018

Applicability

This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act). The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act. (b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. (c) Responsibilities for Handling PII

(1) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. (2) All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location. All contract employees must be:  responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.  responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.  responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.  Email cannot be encrypted. Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment. Do not send PII in the content of an email. (d) Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

(1) OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network. Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment. OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip. Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments. It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agency's network. (2) mail. (e) Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII A password protected file is not secure. Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-

(1) A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic. As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches --

Page 43 of 129

whether they involve paper documents or electronic information. In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. (2) OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk ­ regardless of the time or day of the week. Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPM's IT security experts will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention. The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

D.3.2 - Specialized Technical Area 2: Data Center Support
Data Center Support includes IBM Enterprise Systems Software Support services for the CIO, Operations Technology Management's Data Center (DC) that processes retirement and insurance, investigations, and other administrative workloads.

D.3.2.1 - STA 2.1 - Enterprise Systems Software Support
To support OPM's mission, it is essential that the enterprise system software support provided under the BPA maintain enterprise system and network system stability and keep the enterprise environment finetuned and operating as efficiently as possible. The target availability of all hardware and enterprise system software systems is 99.999% D.3.2.2 - OPM Enterprise Systems and Networks The Chief Information Officer (CIO) operates in a three shift environment and supports remote and local customers through network and channel extension connections. DC uses two IBM 2096 Enterprise Servers configured in a Parallel Sysplex cluster and running the IBM z/OS Server Operating System. This cluster of servers is connected to the OPM LAN via Gigabit Ethernet. The IBM SecureWay Security Server, hosted on the z/OS cluster, provides integrated z/OS Firewall Technologies and RACF security for z/OS resources and data. In addition the z/OS cluster hosts IBM's SecureWay Communications

Page 59 of 129

Server, IBM's HTTP Server, IBM's Telnet Server and IBM WebSphere Internet Server. The communications server provides TCP/IP services for the z/OS Enterprise Servers and includes virtual IP addressing, TN3270e, and IBM's WebSphere Application Server, IBM HTTP Web Server, and SubCapacity Reporting Tool (SCRT) Major components of OPM's systems rely on on-line CICS systems along with WebSphere Application Server applications for data entry and retrieval, claims adjudication, record control, debt collection, financial management, and payment history transactions; and batch systems for record updates, account maintenance, and monthly and year-end financial reports in support of the Retirement Services. The Retirement Services Line of Business services US Federal retiree annuitants using a combination of SoftwareAG's ADABAS and IBM's DB2 for z/OS. The Federal Investigative Services hosts it Personnel Investigation Processing (PIPS) system on the IBM Enterprise which communicate to various distributed server applications. ADABAS, and its associated programming language (NATURAL), are used for case control and other data base applications. IBM's RACF Security System is highly integrated into all systems and applications. The CIO also operates a system of Virtual Linux Servers hosted on one of the two zSeries Enterprise Servers. These systems provide Internet access to retirement applications used by external government agencies. The collection of Linux servers are controlled by IBM's z/VM operating system which is protected by IBM's RACF for VM security product. The Linux operating environment is provided by SuSe and Redhat Linux, UDB/DB2 and Oracle for database management, WebSphere Application Server, and Tivoli Access Manager for eBusiness for its security access. D.3.2.3 - Disaster Recovery and Continuity of Operations OPM has a very extensive Disaster Recovery Plan for the continued operation of its IBM Enterprise Servers and Data Center activities. The principal data center has its Direct Access Storage Devices (DASD) mirrored in a remote geographical location. The remote site is located far away from the principal center, in a secure location, and the OPM-owned DASD units at the site contain duplicate sets of data, updated in real time with changes made in the principal data center. The connections between the Data Center and the remote site are high speed data circuits with modern communications technology. The existing configuration is monitored constantly to ensure continuous mirroring of data to both remote sites. In the event of a disaster impacting the Data Center, processing would move to OPM's primary recovery site, with a minimum number of support personnel deployed for an extended period of time to restore and continue operations. OPM customers would access OPM's data through established communication circuits and work from existing OPM sites, home, or other locations as established. The Disaster Recovery Plan is extensively tested every year with users from business areas testing their critical systems. All of the support staff participates in the testing. A critical part of the test is to simulate the loss of the Data Center's technical support staff, requiring the Contractor to supply 2-3 technically competent individuals with the qualifications of the Senior z/OS Sysplex System Programmers, who will follow very detailed instructions at the recovery site to restore the systems and bring all applications and processes back on line. These individuals must be located and come from a different geographical location than OPM's headquarters. They will only be needed during the annual Disaster Recovery test and in the event of declared disaster event. D.3.2.4 - Environment The software and hardware that OPM uses, whether developed, leased, or commercially purchased, include but are not limited to the following: D.3.2.4.a - Software (a) IBM products such as: z/OS, JES2, ESCON Director Support, Resource Access Control Facility (RACF), EREP, High Level Assembler, ICKDSF, ISPF, TSO/E, High Level Assembler, 3270 PC File Page 60 of 129

RFP: OPM32-11-R-0018

The CIO operates its hardware and software platforms in an IBM Parallel Sysplex environment. A Sysplex is a collection of z/OS systems that cooperate, using certain hardware and software products, to process work. These Sysplex systems are running on a number of Logical Partitions (LPARs) on both of the IBM 2096 zSeries computers. The CIO's objective is to improve performance and increase availability through Sysplex technology. The CIO also operates a number of LPARs, on one of the IBM 2096 computers, with the z/VM operating system for the distinct purposes of running multiple Virtual SuSe & RedHat Linux Servers. These servers provide systems for providing web services, database management, and J2EE/JAVA applications.

D.3.2.5 - Distributed Services The CIO provides other support services such as production control support to OPM program areas responsible for production applications. Most of the work is run on the Enterprise Servers while some of the work runs on distributed platforms such as Windows and Linux Servers. Web services are provided and supported for application development and tools which run on Windows platforms. D.3.2.6 - Continuous Availability . All production work is run on multiple dedicated production Logical Partitions (LPARs). There are Development LPARs where the OPM program areas develop and User Acceptance Test LPARs to test new applications or changes to existing applications. Once the applications are approved by Quality Assurance, they are migrated into production. This methodology gives a higher level of assurance that Page 63 of 129

applications will run error free.

RFP: OPM32-11-R-0018

The Enterprise Servers are configured to achieve continuous availability in the production LPARs and are required to meet the goal of 99.999% continuous operation. All the production z/OS systems in the Parallel Sysplex participate in system failover. If one LPAR fails, the work of that LPAR is automatically initiated in another LPAR. If an entire machine were to fail, its workload and processing would be taken up by the surviving machine. To accommodate the additional workload when failover is initiated, OPM has contracted with IBM for its Capacity Backup feature for both IBM 2096 computers. In the event of a failure of either system, the other system is dynamically upgraded to the maximum power available to the machine.

D.3.6 BPA CALLS The Government will provide each interested BPA contractor (specific to each STA or sub-STA) a fair opportunity to be considered for each Call in excess of $3,000. (The selection of which STA, or sub-STA, is to be competed is at the government's discretion.) OPM will provide this fair opportunity by contacting each BPA contractor for the particular STA prior to issuing a BPA Call Request for Proposal to determine their interest in responding to a requirement. All contractors that indicate they will respond will receive a copy of the BPA Call Request for Proposal. However, OPM reserves the right, upon consideration of the factors listed below, not to contact each BPA contractor before selecting a BPA Call awardee. These factors include: a) Past performance, quality of deliverables, cost control, cost, and other factors the Government believes are relevant to the placement of a Call; b) The agency need for the services or supplies is of such urgency that such opportunity would result in unacceptable delays; c) Only one awardee is capable of providing the services or supplies required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services covered by the call are unique or highly specialized; or d) The Call should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on Call to an already issued Call under the BPA, provided that all the BPA contractors were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original Call. D.3.6.1 BPA Call Request for Proposal When the Government has a BPA call requirement, it will, time permitting, issue a written BPA Call Request for Proposal.

(b) Amendments to solicitations - If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals: (i) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror.

a. Any proposal received at the office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of proposals will not be considered unless it is received before award is made and i. It was sent by registered or certified mail not later than the fifth calendar day before the date specified for receipt of proposals (e.g., a proposal submitted in response to a solicitation requiring receipt of offers by the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th); It was sent by mail (or telegram or facsimile, if authorized) or hand carried (including delivery by a commercial carrier) if it is determined by the Government that the late

ii.

Page 121 of 129

receipt was due primarily to Government mishandling after receipt at the Government agency; iii. It was sent by U.S. Postal Service Express Mail Next Day Service Post Office to Addressee, not later than 5:00 p.m. at the place of mailing two working days prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals. The term "working days"' excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays; It was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation and was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the activity designated for receipt of proposals and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of proposals, and the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late proposal would not unduly delay the procurement; or It is the only proposal received.

Any modification or revision of a proposal or response to request for information, including any final proposal revision, is subject to the same conditions. (d) Blanket Purchase Agreement Award(s). a. The Government intends to award multiple BPAs to the responsible offerors whose proposals represent the best value, after an evaluation is performed in accordance with the evaluation factors in this solicitation. While we may award multiple BPAs, we will only award the number of BPAs we believe sufficient to meet our needs and regulatory competition requirements. For example, even if we have six firms that are technically acceptable and responsible with fair and reasonable prices, we may award less than six BPAs if we have no need for six sources of this service. b. The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. c. The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

d. The Government shall evaluate proposals and reserves the right to award BPAs with or without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of proposals (e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors, but not rising to the level of discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. e. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity proposed, at the unit cost or prices proposed, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. f. Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

g. The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an Page 122 of 129

acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. h. A BPA is not a contract, neither party is bound to its terms. However, if a BPA Callr is issued under the BPA and the BPA holder agrees to provide the service, that individual order becomes a binding contract between the parties and both parties are then bound to all the terms and conditions in the BPA for that order.

EVALUATION PROCESS

FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION ­ COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. All Offerors must submit a proposal for the Base and all Option years.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option. (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of Provision)

ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2
NOTE TO OFFERORS: This addendum describes how proposals will be evaluated. The Addendum 52.212-1 provides instructions to offerors. That addendum describes what the offeror should include in the proposal. Your attention is directed to both. RELATIVE ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: Each proposal will be evaluated with respect to Technical, Past Performance, and Price. Technical and past performance factors are of equal importance, and when combined, are significantly more important than Price. If there are no significant technical differences among offerors and they are determined `technically equal', price will be the determining factor for award. The evaluation will be conducted using the evaluation criteria as set forth in this Section. The offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. Proposal clarifications/revision requests may be issued which encompass any and all written documentation submitted in response to the RFP as may be deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to fully explore and evaluate the merits of the proposal submitted. TRADE-OFF PROCESS: This is a Best Value acquisition using the trade-off process. As such, the Selection Authority, in making the final Trade-Off judgment, will consider the merits of non-Price Factors of the proposal against the total evaluated Price in arriving at the final selection decision. As part of the best value determination, the relative advantages/disadvantages of each offerors non-Price Factor proposals, and the total evaluated Price, shall be considered in selecting the offers which represent the best value to the Government. The Government may award to other than the Offeror(s) with the lowest total price. Following are the evaluation factors for award in descending order of importance: FACTOR 1: Understanding the Federal IT policy and guidance, the Performance Work Statement and Technical Approach The offeror shall provide a written description demonstrating its understanding of the nature and extent of OPM's requirement for IT services as described in RFP Section D, Attachment 1. This narrative must be more than a mere repetition of the descriptions provided in the solicitation. Your narrative should, at a minimum, include the following: (1) Indicate your understanding of the nature and extent of the type of work to be performed at OPM, and indicate your firm's capability of meeting these types of requirements and corporate experience. (2) Indicate the initial plan to gain an understanding of OPM's operations needs. (3) Provide a plan for staffing projects once identified. Describe how you will manage the work of your staff and how you will ensure quality control. (4) Describe your strategy for dealing with potential significant technical, administrative, or managerial problems that could arise during performance of a BPA Call.

FACTOR 2: IT Resources/Personnel Qualifications/Staffing In this section, the offeror shall provide the resumes of the proposed principal/point of contact, other key personnel, and supporting personnel, as well as a staffing plan. Resumes should present sufficient information to determine the proposed individual's qualifications to successfully perform the required Page 127 of 129

services. The contractor shall provide a letter of intent for all proposed key personnel.

RFP: OPM32-11-R-0018

FACTOR 3: Past performance: Quality of Work products, timeliness of deliverables, staffing retention, cost control, business relations, and customer satisfaction. In this section the offeror shall provide summary descriptions of work undertaken by the offeror in Federal, state or local government agencies or with commercial entities that substantiate its ability to perform work of the kind described in Section D of the RFP. NOTE: OPM reserves the right to consider the offeror's past performance not specifically listed in the Technical Proposal. Offerors may also include in this section a description of any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high quality process for producing the service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, other Government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications. Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three (3) years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. FACTOR 4: Corporate experience in the design, development, implementation, operation, management, and maintenance of human resources management IT systems. The offeror will provide evidence that demonstrates the capability to provide the full range of IT services for which they are proposing. The evidence will also demonstrate that the offeror has the capacity to respond to a growth in support services requests in a timely manner.

FACTOR 5: Price ­ Not rated, but will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness. A price is considered reasonable if that price does not exceed what a prudent person would normally incur in conducting competitive business. In determining whether offeror prices are reasonable, the proposed labor rates, labor skill mixes and other rates proposed to the Government for prime, team member and subcontractor labor, must reflect the use of prudent judgment and sound business practice. Sound business practice includes compliance with governing regulations about estimating and accounting assumptions supporting proposed labor. The Price Proposal shall be submitted in accordance with Volume III instructions and shall include pricing for the base and option years using Microsoft Excel format. Offerors shall provide definitions of the experience/education/expertise levels required for the labor categories proposed for performing the services required under the RFP Special Technical Areas (STAs). Offerors must submit their price proposal based on the pricing contained in their published price list and/or GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), if applicable. Offerors are encouraged to provide discounts from their published price list and/or FSS Schedule prices. Offerors shall include in their proposed rates, all costs to the Government associated with accomplishing the required STAs, including direct labor, fringe benefits, G&A, overhead, profit or fee where applicable. In the event that either (a) the proposed labor skill mix appears to be inappropriate for achieving the Government's requirements, or (b) proposed labor rates do not appear likely to enable hiring or retaining the proposed skills, the proposed skill mix for either the offeror or its team members/subcontractors will be adjusted to reflect the most probable

TECHNICAL EVALUATION:

The award will be made based on the following adjective ratings.

Rating Blue (Excellent)

Rating Definitions for Technical Factors Definition and Criteria Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the Government. A proposal must have one or more strengths and no deficiencies to receive a blue. Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements. A proposal must have no deficiencies to receive a green, but may have one or more strengths. Does not clearly meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance. Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements. Proposals with an unacceptable rating are not awardable.

Green (Acceptable)

Yellow (Marginal)

Red (Unacceptable)

E.4 EVALUATION APPROACH ­ PAST PERFORMANCE Past Performance Risk Rating Definitions. A rating of High Risk, Moderate Risk, Low Risk, or Unknown Risk, as defined below. The past performance evaluation factor will be adjectivally rated according to the guidance provided below:

Rating Low Risk (LR)

Rating Standards for Past Performance Definition and Criteria Verification of past performance shows that offeror consistently meets work schedules, provides specified services, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years. Verification of past performance shows offeror meets work schedules and specified services most of the time, meets contract terms without failure or resolves issues immediately, and has not been defaulted on any contract within the past three years. Verification of past performance shows that offeror has consistently not met work schedules and other obligations, has defaulted on at least one contract within the past three years, or has chronically failed to meet contract terms, or the past performance information provided is not relevant to this requirement.

Moderate Risk (MR)

High Risk (HR)

Page 129 of 129

Unknown Risk (UR)

No record of past performance or contact information (telephone, facsimile, or electronic mail address) is available and/or is not valid and/or the points of contact or agencies could not be reached. IAW FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), in the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

RFP: OPM32-11-R-0018

The Past Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements and delivering high quality products and services as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy, and recency of the offeror's past performance, as well as that of its team members/key subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. When assessing past performance, the Government will focus its inquiry on the past performance of the offeror and its proposed team members/key subcontractors as it relates to projects of similar size, scope and complexity to the requirements described in the solicitation. Subcontractor past performance will be evaluated as part of the proposal if the subcontractors are identified and if the proposal includes a written unconditional letter of commitment from each subcontractor to undertake performance under any resultant contract. Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily obtain information on all of the listed contract references and/or may not be able to contact all of the identified POCs provided by the offerors, it is incumbent upon the offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. In the event that adverse past performance information is obtained from other sources, the offeror will have the opportunity to respond to any adverse information received on which it had not had a previous opportunity to comment. Contract references will be reviewed to determine the relevancy and recency of the past performance information. Each contract reference determined to be relevant and recent will be assessed as to the quality of the offeror's past performance. E.5 EVALUATION APPROACH ­ PRICING

Price Proposal ­ Volume III will not be rated. The Government will evaluate all aspects of the price proposal for fairness, reasonableness, realism, and for providing the best value to the Government. Offers found to be unreasonably high or unrealistically low may be considered unacceptable and may be rejected on that basis. The Government will evaluate the realism of the offeror's proposed prices to determine whether the proposed price is realistic for the work to be performed, reflects a clear understanding of the requirements; and is consistent with the methods of performance described in the offeror's proposal. If an offeror's price is deemed to be unrealistic in any of these respects, the Government will factor this consideration into the applicable non-price ratings. The agency may reject an offer that reflects a serious lack of price realism.

E.6 EVALUATION DEFINITIONS: The following definitions will be employed in rating all aspects of the offeror's proposal: 1. Significant Strength. A significant strength appreciably enhances the merit of a proposal or Page 130 of 129

appreciably increases the probability of successful contract performance. 2. Strength. Any aspect of a proposal when judged against a stated evaluation criterion, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract. 3.Weakness. A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. 4. Significant Weakness. A flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract Performance. 5. Deficiency. A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. 6. Uncertainty. Any aspect of the proposal for which the intent of the offeror is unclear because there may be more than one way to interpret the offer or because inconsistencies in the offer indicate that there may be an error, omission or mistake. Examples include a mistake in calculation or measurement and contradictory statements. 7. Failed to Meet. Offeror's response does not meet most of the minimum requirements of the solicitation. 8. Partially Met. Offeror's response meets most but not all of the minimum requirements of the solicitation. 9. Met. Offeror's response meets all of the minimum requirements of the solicitation.
