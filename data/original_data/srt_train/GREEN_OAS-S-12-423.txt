The live test demonstration shall be limited to the features offered in the written offer and the provided test scenarios. Live Test Demonstration Constraints: Attendance at the demonstration and the subsequent question and answer session should be limited to 5 corporate representatives of the Off eror's team. The Offeror will be given 30 minutes for set up. After opening remarks by the Government, the Offeror will be given a total of 90 minutes (excluding setup) to demonstrate the capabilities of their product, perform the provided test scenarios, and answer Government questions. The time will be equally divided into three segments. Each segment will be stopped precisely after 30 minutes. Upon completion of the first two segments (demonstration of capabilities and test scenarios), the Government will caucus to discuss the Offeror's demonstration and to formulate any questions regarding the presentation. The Offeror will then address any questions or clarifications posed by the Contracting Officer or the Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) Chairman. The question and answer session will last no more than 30 minutes. If necessary, the Offeror may briefly caucus to coordinate responses to specific questions or clarifications. The total setup, presentations, caucus, and question and answer sessions are expected to last approximately 2 hours. The times discussed in this paragraph, other than that given for the live test demonstration and test scenarios, are for planning purposes only, and may extend beyond the time-frames provided as may be required to ensure a complete understanding of the contractor's capabilities. During the Live Test Demonstration the Offeror shall not present or discuss any information related to the price evaluation factor.

E. 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the
14

Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1 - Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement Factor 2 - Live test demonstration Factor 3 - Past performance Factor 4 - Price The non-price factors are listed in descending order of importance. The non-price factors (factors 1-3), when combined, are significantly more important than the price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The Government reserves the right to split the award between up to two offerors. The Government may award one contract for all services (CLIN 0005a or b/0006, 1005a or b/1006, etc.), award two separate contracts, or not make an award. If the Government awards two separate contracts, one vendor will provide "News, Business and Financial, Reference, Public Record Services" (CLIN 0001/0002, 1001/1002, etc.) and another vendor will provide "Legal Information Services" (CLIN 0003a or b/0004, 1003a or b/1004, etc.). The Government may select for award the Contractor whose price is not necessarily the lowest, but whose technical proposal represents the best value to the Government thus warranting the additional cost. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal that includes any assumption or condition that is contrary to, or takes exception to, the Government's requirements. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Evaluation Factor 1- Technical Capability to Meet Requirements - The Government will review the description of the product(s) and assess the quality of the proposed product(s) to meet
15

each of the content and functionality requirements included in the Statement of Work. Offers will be evaluated for each requirement as to the product's ability to exceed, meet, or not meet the Government's needs. Evaluation Factor 2- Live Test Demonstration ­ The purpose of the demonstration is to give the Offeror the opportunity to highlight its technical solution. The demonstration will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's solution meets the Government's requirements, and to assess the product's ease of use, functionality, and user interface. The Government will provide predetermined test scenarios to the offerors before the demonstration. The live test demonstration shall be limited to the features offered in the written offer and the provided test scenarios. Evaluation Factor 3- Past Performance- The past performance evaluation will examine how the contractor's past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction for the EOP. In conducting the past performance assessment, the Government may use data obtained from other sources as well as that provided in the proposal. The Government will evaluate past performance as a measure of the Government's confidence in the Offeror's ability to successfully perform based on a demonstrated record of performance. The Government will first determine the relevancy of the past or present performance by assessing whether the Offeror's recent efforts are of a similar size, scope and complexity to the effort required by the SOW. Performance determined relevant will then be evaluated as follows: First, the Government will assign a past performance rating which indicates the level of performance on past and present efforts. The Government will then apply a confidence rating to relevant past performance based on how well the Offeror performed on recent contracts. Evaluation Factor 4- Price- The Offeror shall submit their price utilizing the schedule above. The CLIN structure allows offerors that may not be able to provide all of the services required for both "News, Business and Financial, Reference, Public Record Services" and "Legal Information Services" to submit a compliant offer. Offerors that can provide all services listed in this Request for Proposal are highly encouraged to propose prices for all CLINs. The Government reserves the right to split the award between up to two offerors. The Government will evaluate the price proposed for each CLIN for the base and all options periods, in determining which offer or combination of offers provides the best value to the Government. An offer that is materially unbalanced as to prices may be rejected as being unacceptable.
