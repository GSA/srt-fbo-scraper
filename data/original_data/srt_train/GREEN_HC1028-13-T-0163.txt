The following paragraphs, IAW FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), are provided to support

Brand Name limited source justification for proposed orders exceeding the micro-purchase

threshold, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.



The renewal of brand name AtHoc Software Mass Notification System for United States Air Force (USAF) Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) will be a firm fixed price (FFP) delivery order under NAICS 541519 on the Open Market. Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) F4FFCK3196GC01 Air Force Operational and Maintenance funds will be used for this procurement. The period of performance is 09 August 2013 through 08 September 2013. 



AFMC currently has the AtHoc software in use since the award of the original contract. AFMC is putting together an AF Consolidated contract to consolidate all of the MAJCOM EMNS contracts. AtHoc IWSAlerts provides enterprise-class, network-centric mass notification and emergency communication systems customized for military, government, healthcare, higher education and commercial organizations. The AtHoc solutions automate the end-to-end emergency communication process, delivering physical security, force protection, situational awareness, and personnel accountability. The AtHoc IWSAlerts mass notification system uses the IP network to send critical audio/visual alerts to personnel via all connected channels and devices. The AtHoc solution provides secure and scalable software for seamless implementation of enterprise-wide notification procedures. If AFMC would change to a different software, they would have to retrain the field on the use of a different product and possibly change the configurations of the servers supporting this application. This contract is a follow-on to the existing contract and extension. AFMC has been waiting for the award of the AF consolidation contract which has been delayed. It would be extremely difficult and costly to transition to a new product while AFMC awaits the AF initiative.

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

how the offeror addresses potential or actual conflicts of interest and identify how they will avoid, neutralize, or mitigate present or future
conflicts of interest.

                                                                 (End of clause)




52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(A) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

(B)  Technically Acceptable Proposal: Offerors’ proposals shall demonstrate a clear understanding of the technical requirements and a
comprehensive, systematic approach to accomplishing tasks in all areas identified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and constraints
specified in this solicitation.  Failure to be found technically acceptable will result in the offeror being ineligible for award.

(C) Price Reasonable Proposal: The Government will verify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated,
and prices are presented in a clear and useful format.  DISA will perform an evaluation of the offeror’s technical proposals and proposed costs
to ensure the solution costs are reasonable and appropriate.

      1) The offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness.  The total evaluated will be the sum of all
      CLINs for the basic and all options to include the Option to Extend Services under FAR 52.217-8. Option pricing for the additional 6-month
      period authorized IAW FAR 52.217-8 shall be identical to those in effect immediately prior to exercising any option period in accordance
      with FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services. Ensure you include the pricing in your proposal.


      (2) Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.

      (3) The offeror’s price proposal will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404.

      (4) The Government will verify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly  calculated, and prices are
presented in a clear and useful format.

 (D) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of
options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(E) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration
time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice
of withdrawal is received before award.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the

-

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)
