      spectrometry.
  23. The system should be capable of polarity switching in ESI and APCI modes within a single chromatographic run in at most 50 ms without
      signal degradation.
  24. The system operating footprint should require less than eight (8) linear feet of bench space, including floor space for pump and waste.
  25. The system should allow source cleaning without breaking the vacuum.
  26. The LCMSMS system should have a current Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP)
      certification.
  27. The system should include a scroll pump.
  28. LIMS Interface
       i. The interface should have bidirectional batch and discrete sample processing capabilities.
      ii. The interface should be sufficiently robust to allow the transmission of requisitions and results while undergoing security scanning.
     iii. The LIMS interface should have existing Data Innovation (DI) drivers for the current version (Instrument Manager v8.12) of the DI
          middleware
      iv. The contractor should include support during the warranty period to update the LIMS interface to take advantage of vendor features
          beyond the enclosed results file specification (See List of Attachments: Attachment III – Sequence_file_specifications.docx, Attachment
          IV – c0057599.pdf, Attachment V - LCMS_File_specifications.docx, Attachment VI - LCMS_captured_fields.pdf, and Attachment VII -
          TCB713SS-1768-SLS-201308051115.pdf) through a mutually agreed upon results specification update.
       v. The LIMS interface should include Direct Database Access (ODBC), and Oracle SQL*Net database access.
      vi. The interface should transmit tune (instrument calibration) information/results for each tune event.
     vii. The transmitted data should include a date/time stamp capturing the order the Calibration, Quality Control, and individual Samples are
          run.
    viii. The interface should capture and retransmit reinjected and reprocessed Calibration, Quality Control, and Sample results data.
      ix. The LCMSMS system should include the capability for data transmission via Wide Area Network (TCP/IP-Ethernet).
       x. The LCMSMS system should allow the processing of samples even if the LIMS is offline. If the LIMS is offline, the interface should save
          test results until the LIMS is available and then allow result transmission when the LIMS is available.
      xi. The system should allow full data review if data is stored in a vendor supplied database.
     xii. Documentation:
          1. The contractor should provide full user guide documentation and interface specifications (including hardware and software
             specifications) to the government.
          2. If the LCMSMS system controller has a macro or a programming language the vendor should provide documentation on the language to
             include a manual on all macro/program language commands and syntax.
    xiii. The LCMSMS system LIMS interface should be capable of operating over a wide area network (WAN).
  29. Data Acquisition and Processing Requirements
       i. The system should use the existing batch worklist specification for batch validation.  The current worklist specification is enclosed
          (See List of Attachments: Attachment III - Sequence_file_specifications.docx and Attachment IV - c0057599.pdf)).
      ii. If the sample LAN barcode is read during injection, the system should provide a flag indicating a mismatch between the expected and
          actual barcode read.
     iii. If the sample LAN barcode is read during the sample tray setup, the system should stop the setup until the sample order matches the
          batch worklist.


Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Requirements for Information Assurance (IA):
   1. The system, including all contractor and subcontractor-provided hardware and software, shall undergo Information Assurance (IA)
      Certification and Accreditation (C&A) for each laboratory; adherence to the attached guidelines will assist successful IA C&A. The system
      shall successfully receive Authority to Operate (ATO) certification for each laboratory by either Army, Navy, or Air Force (dependent on
      the network on which each laboratory’s system resides) and, if required, successfully receive Authority to Connect (ATC) certification.  If
      the C&A process identifies issues which would lead to denial of ATO, contractor shall remedy the issues to the satisfaction of the
      government within six (6) months of notification.  If the C&A process identifies issues which would lead to denial of Interim Authority to
      Operate (IATO), contractor shall remedy the issues to the satisfaction of the government within six (6) months of notification.  The vendor
      shall meet with the government to provide a plan to address the issues identified. The vendor shall provide a monthly status report on the
      progress addressing the issues.
   2. The contractor shall comply with USN IA Cont Lang 26OCT12.docx (See List of Attachments: Attachment I – USN IA Cont Lang 26OCT12.docx). As
      part of the proposal, the contractor shall submit the enclosed C&A Questionnaire (See List of Attachments: Attachment II - USN CA Technical
      Questionnaire.docx with the Blue Section completely filled out.

SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS
CONTRACTOR SUPPORT

NOTICE:  NAVY USE OF SUPPORT CONTRACTOR FOR CONTRACT CLOSEOUT FUNCTIONS

Naval Medical Logistics Command uses two private contractors in support of the contract closeout process.  Those companies are Contracting
Resources Group, Inc. from Baltimore, MD, doing business under the authority of the Small Business Administration’s 8(a) program, and the
Ability One Program, doing business under the authority of the Javits-Wagner O’Day Act (41 U.S.C. § 47).

The contract closeout process includes activities such as processing de-obligation modifications, obtaining contractor and requiring activity
concurrence, preparing the DD-Form 1594 (Contract Completion Statement), and preparing closed files for archiving.  Support contractors may
perform additional administrative duties, including filing and processing simple administrative modifications.  Performing these functions
require the contractor employees to have access to the contract file.  Therefore, information you provide to the Government or information
already in the possession of the Government may be viewed by these support contractors in the course of performing contract close-out functions.
 The information that may be made available to the contractor may include pricing and technical proposals and performance information.

Naval Medical Logistics Command has signed Non-Disclosure Agreements with each support contractor employee and has required both contractors to
provide a Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan to ensure these employees are
firewalled from all business development activity.

By submission of its proposal that was accepted by the Government, the contractor and its subcontractors consent to access of their business
sensitive/confidential or proprietary data by the Government’s support contractor personnel in order to perform closeout services.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have      , have not      , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)


ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1
Addendum to 52.212-1 – Instructions to Offerors

In addition to the guidance included in FAR Provision 52.212-1 entitled “Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items,” the following are
applicable for the preparation and submission of proposals.

Proposal Content and Instructions for Preparation of Proposals.

Instructions for preparation of proposals.  This section specifies the format and content that offerors shall use in this Request for Proposal
(RFP).  The intent is not to restrict the offerors in the manner in which they will perform their work but rather to ensure a certain degree of
uniformity in the format of the responses for evaluation purposes.  Offerors must submit a proposal that is legible and comprehensive enough to
provide the basis for a sound evaluation by the Government.  Information provided should be precise, factual, and complete.  Legibility,
clarity, completeness, and responsiveness are of the utmost importance.  Proposals shall be in the form prescribed by, and shall contain a
response to, each of the areas identified in the Addendum to 52.212-1.  Any proposal that does not provide, as a minimum, that which is required
in this solicitation may be determined to be substantially incomplete and not warrant any further consideration.  The Government shall award a
contract to the responsible offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS

Offerors shall provide sufficient written technical documentation to allow for thorough evaluation of the proposal.  Additionally, the offeror
shall fully explain their ability to meet the requirements in a point-by-point narrative form.  The offeror shall demonstrate the conformity of
the proposed product to meet the general requirements.

Proposals shall be submitted in two volumes:  Volume I shall include Conformance to Essential Characteristics: Minimum Requirements, Design
Quality and Capability, Information Assurance, and Past Performance and shall not include any pricing information.  Volume II shall include all
information required under Volume II Instructions.

VOLUME I INSTRUCTIONS

Volume I shall include sufficiently detailed information to enable evaluation based on the four (4) factors listed below in order of decreasing
priority:

1. Conformance to Essential Characteristics: Minimum Requirements– The offeror shall include information to enable the evaluation of the
proposed system’s ability to meet the Essential Characteristics: Minimum Requirements.

2. Design Quality and Capability – The offeror shall include information to enable the evaluation of the design quality and capabilities of the
proposed system.  The offeror shall also include information to enable the evaluation of the maintainability and operational efficiency of the
proposed equipment. The offeror shall provide information on service and maintenance coverage options. Evaluation will include a review of the
system’s ability to meet or exceed the Enhancing Factors.

3. Information Assurance – The offeror shall include information to enable the evaluation of the proposed system’s capability to meet the
Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Requirements for Information Assurance (IA) (Navy IA) requirements.  The contractor shall complete the
blue section of the Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) C&A Initial Technical Questionnaire (See List of Attachments: Attachment II – USN CA
Technical Questionnaire.docx). An incomplete NMLC C&A Initial Technical Questionnaire will result in an incomplete proposal and the offeror will
no longer be considered for award.

4. Past Performance – The offeror shall include information to enable the evaluation of the offeror's recent relevant past performance record as
to (1) the functional performance of the proposed or similar Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry systems that the offeror has
delivered to previous customers, and (2) the quality and timeliness of the technical assistance, hardware and software updates/upgrades that the
offeror has supplied to its customers following the initial fielding of those systems.

The government reserves the right to consider other past performance information at its disposal, in addition to any information obtained from
the references provided above.  The government is likely to randomly select references provided for contact and does not commit to contact every
reference.

Offerors shall provide past performance data for all similar contracts for the last 3 years, up to 4 data points, or 4 data points for delivery
starting with the most recent contracts for which delivery occurred at least 3 months prior to the closing of this solicitation.  The data shall
include: Organization/Location, POC/Number, Contract Reference Number, Contract Date, Value of the Contract, and “Has the POC agreed to be
contacted as a reference?”

Page limit for Volume I: There is a one hundred (100) page limit for Volume I. The table of contents, Operator Training Manual, and coversheet
are NOT included in the page limit. A page is defined as size 8.5 inch by 11 inch with one (1) inch margins all around, Times New Roman font of
not less than ten (10) point font size.

VOLUME II INSTRUCTIONS

Offerors shall be evaluated to ensure reasonableness and completeness.  The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract.
Offerors shall submit firm-fixed pricing for all the above requirements (CLINs 0001 - 6002).  Include any applicable discounts to the
Government.

Offerors shall provide the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) number, if the equipment is on FSS, or make note if the equipment is Open Market.

Offerors shall provide the following company details:

Complete company name and address:
Company Point of Contact (POC):
Email Address:

The offeror shall include a statement with the offerors Volume II acknowledging the solicitation and all amendments issued under this
solicitation.

Small Business Subcontracting Plan:

If applicable (for other than small business concern offerors under the assigned NAICS code herein), the offeror shall submit a subcontracting
plan in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-9 and DFARS Clause 252.219-7003 (for reference see FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.704). The subcontracting
plan requirement is not applicable to small business concerns qualified as such under the NAICS code assigned to this solicitation. Master
subcontracting plans can be included as an appendix to the subcontracting plan.

The Contracting officer will review the subcontracting plan for acceptability.  If an offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan
acceptable to the Contracting Officer within the time limit prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the offeror will be ineligible for award.  If
the offeror believes there are no subcontracting possibilities, the offeror shall submit documentation sufficient to support its position.

Page limit for Volume II: There is NO page limit for Volume II. A page is defined as size 8.5 inch by 11 inch with one (1) inch margins all
around, Times New Roman font of not less than ten (10) point font size.

File Submission.

Offerors are invited to submit a proposal in accordance with Instructions to Offerors, to arrive electronically through the AMRDEC SAFE website
no later than the proposal due date for this solicitation.  The Government does not authorize submission of telegraphic, facsimile, paper or
CDROM offers via hand carry or mail carrier for this solicitation.

All proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will be submitted electronically via the AMRDEC SAFE website. No paper copies or
electronic copies submitted outside of the SAFE website (i.e., emailed directly to the contract specialist or other NMLC email inbox) will be
accepted.

Submitting your proposal:

The AMRDEC SAFE application is used to send large files to individuals which would normally be too large to send via email. There are no user
accounts for SAFE - authentication is handled via email and Civilian Access Card (CAC). The application is available for use by offerors.

The AMRDEC SAFE application can be accessed via https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe.

Offerors shall proceed as “Non- CAC Users” under all circumstances.

(field names are in italics):

Personal Information:
Your Name - Your name, Your Company Name.
Your Email address - Your email address.
Confirm Your Email Address - Re-enter your email address.

File Information:

File(s) - Click the "Browse" button to select your file(s). You may add up to 25 files per package, so long as the total file size does not
exceed 2GB. The total file size is the combined file size of all submitted files.
Deletion Date – Leave this date at the default setting of two weeks (14 days) from the submission date.

Recipient Information:
Manually Enter Email Address: Input amanda.rutten@med.navy.mil and hit the add button. (To remove a recipient, highlight their name and click
the "Remove" button.)

Email Settings:
Check all four of the boxes:
      - Encrypt email message when possible.
      - Notify me when file(s) downloads are STARTED.

      - Require CAC for Pick-up (all recipients will need to log in with a CAC to download file(s).

To the right of “Email Settings” is a nondescript box with two options (None or FOUO). Select the FOUO option and select “sensitive” from the
dropdown menu below.

Review all fields for accuracy and hit the ‘submit” button. Clicking the "Submit" button will upload the files and submit the package. Guest
users will need to check their email to verify their email address before the recipients will be notified.  After the package has been uploaded,
the Government will receive a link to the package download page as well as a password. These passwords are unique for each recipient (not the
package), and will be disabled once SAFE detects that the user successfully downloaded each file within the package.

Once the offeror has submitted their proposal, they shall send a confirmation email to amanda.rutten@med.navy.mil and provide their company name
and contact information as well stating that they have submitted a complete proposal to SAFE in response to solicitation N62645-14-R-0049.
Submission of proposals is a onetime affair (unless in unusual circumstances multiple SAFE submissions are required because an offeror exceeded
the 25 file limit per SAFE submission.). Additional documents will not be accepted after receipt of the confirmation email from the offeror to
the amanda.rutten@med.navy.mil inbox that confirms successful submission of the proposal.

Any data previously submitted in response to another solicitation, whether submitted to the Naval Medical Logistics Command or another agency,
should be assumed to be unavailable during this proposal evaluation and source selection process.  Proposal data shall not be incorporated into
the proposal by referring to another proposal or other source.


The Government reserves the right to request additional information after receipt of Offeror’s response to the RFP. The proposal shall be valid
for not less than 180 calendar days from the proposal due date. The Offeror shall make a clear statement that the proposal is valid until such
date in Volume I.


Offerors are cautioned that in order for their proposal to be eligible for award, the proposal shall be in compliance with all of the terms and
conditions set forth in the RFP.

Files shall be in Microsoft Office for Windows format (2007 or 1997-2003), either .doc or .docx file and/or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf file), with one
(1) inch margins all around, Times New Roman font of not less than ten (10) point font size.

Each volume shall contain the following items in addition to the technical/descriptive data required by this Request for Proposal (RFP):

Cover sheet which indicates RFP Number, Name and Address of Offeror.

Table of contents which provides sufficient detail as to allow the important elements to be easily located.

Each page of each document shall have a footer indicating the name of the offeror, “page X of Y,” and the following legend “Source Selection
Information: See FAR Part 3.104.”

Questions concerning the proposal are due no later than 02:00 PM Local Time, on 14 May 2014.  Questions shall be submitted to
Amanda.Rutten@med.navy.mil by the required time, and no questions shall be addressed after this cutoff date.  Offerors shall submit one set of
questions only; multiple emails shall not be accepted.  An amendment to the solicitation will be issued providing responses to the questions.

Discussions. The Government reserves the right to make award without entering into discussions. Offerors shall be prepared to enter into
discussions and/or negotiations and, if authorized by the Contracting Officer, may be allowed to revise or modify their proposals.  For those
Offerors in the initial competitive range, the Government will submit Discussion Items, which will require a response per instructions that will

FAR 52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible respondent whose offer conforming to the
solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors, in order of decreasing
priority, shall be used to evaluate offers:

1. Conformance to Essential Characteristics: Minimum Requirements
2. Design Quality and Capability
3. Information Assurance
4. Past Performance
5. Price

This is a best value procurement. The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of Conformance to
Essential Characteristics: Minimum Requirements, Design Quality and Capability, Information Assurance, Past Performance, and Price. As part of
making the assessment, a best value analysis will be performed determining whether or not exceeding the minimum requirements at an associated
price provides the best value to the Government. As individual factors, the following factors will be considered in order of decreasing
priority: Conformance to Essential Characteristics: Minimum Requirements, Design Quality and Capability, Information Assurance, and Past
Performance.  Price is the least important of all the factors.

As a basis for award, trade-offs between price and non-price factors are permitted.  Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award a
contract to other than the lowest proposed price or other than the highest technically rated proposal. However, the closer the merits of the
Conformance to Essential Characteristics: Minimum Requirements, Design Quality and Capability, Information Assurance, and Past Performance are
to one another, the greater importance of Price in making the award determination.

VOLUME I

Volume I must include sufficiently detailed information to enable evaluation based on the four (4) factors listed below in order of decreasing
priority:

1. Conformance to Essential Characteristics: Minimum Requirements – Evaluation shall include the ability to meet the Essential Characteristics:
Minimum Requirements.  Offerors not meeting all requirements will not be further considered for award unless there are no other technically
acceptable offerors. This will be rated either Pass or Fail.

2. Design Quality and Capability – The government will evaluate the design quality and capability of the proposed system.  The government will
also evaluate Enhancing Factors, maintenance support options, and operational efficiency of the proposed equipment.


3. Information Assurance – The government will evaluate the capability of the proposed system to meet the Certification and Accreditation (C&A)
Requirements for Information Assurance (IA) (Navy Information Assurance IA) requirements.  This evaluation will be based the completed blue
section of the NMLC C&A Initial Technical Questionnaire (See List of Attachments: Attachment II – USN CA Technical Questionnaire.docx).

4. Past Performance – Government will evaluate the offeror's recent relevant past performance record as to (1) the functional performance of the
proposed or similar LCMSMS systems that the offeror has delivered to previous customers, and (2) the quality and timeliness of the technical
assistance, hardware and software updates/upgrades that the offeror has supplied to its customers following the initial fielding of those
systems.

VOLUME II

Price will not be scored or rated.  Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more of the price analysis techniques in FAR 15.404.
Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable.  Inasmuch as the best value offer will be determined
through tradeoff analysis, the Government is not bound to award to the lowest evaluated price.  On the other hand, if the Government determines
that a higher rated proposal offers value-added features but at an unreasonable/unjustifiable incremental amount, it is not bound to award to a
higher technically rated proposal.

The proposal will be evaluated for completeness. Completeness is the offeror’s proposal being submitted in accordance with instructions in the
solicitation, specifically the Addendum to 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors, Volume II Instructions in its entirety.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

(End of provision)

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA,

The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines
that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the
solicitation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
principals—

(1) ( ___   ) Are, ( ___   ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by
any Federal agency; and

(2) ( ___   ) Have, ( ___   ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state
or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or
Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating
Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) ( ___   ) Are, ( ___   ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission
of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) [ ___  ballot] Have, [ ___  ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes
in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in

252.204-7011  ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)

(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to
facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit
line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense
Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not
conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing
payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are
requested in this solicitation to
ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.

(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item
structure follow.
