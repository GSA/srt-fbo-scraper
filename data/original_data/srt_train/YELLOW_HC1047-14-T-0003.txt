52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout--Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order. The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing. In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this contract/order. A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification. A Contractor's failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order. If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

The OCCIP shall describe how the offeror addresses potential or actual conflicts of interest and identify how they will avoid, neutralize, or mitigate present or future conflicts of interest. (b) Offerors must consider whether their involvement and participation raises any OCCI issues, especially in the following areas when: (1) Providing systems engineering and technical direction. (2) Preparing specifications or work statements and/or objectives. (3) Providing evaluation services. (4) Obtaining access to proprietary information. (c) If a prime contractor or subcontractor breaches any of the OCCI restrictions, or does not disclose or misrepresents any relevant facts concerning its conflict of interest, the government may take appropriate action, including terminating the contract, in additional to any remedies that may be otherwise permitted by the contract or operation of law.
