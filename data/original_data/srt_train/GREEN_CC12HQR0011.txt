TRAVEL The contractor shall be responsible for all travel and associated costs in the performance of this contract. (End of Clause) H.5. NON-PAYMENT FOR ADDITIONAL WORK In no event shall any understanding or agreement, contract modification, or other matter in deviation from the terms of this contract between the Contractor and a person other than the Contracting Officer (CO) be effective or binding upon the Government. The CO is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract that authority remains solely with the CO. Any additional services or a change to the work specified which may be performed by the Contractor, either at his/her own volition or at the request of an individual other than a duly appointed CO except as may be explicitly authorized in the contract/order, is not authorized and will not be paid for by the OCC. Only a duly appointed CO is authorized to change the specifications, terms and conditions in this contract. (End of Clause) H.6. 1052.204-8002 (OCC) REQUIRED CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (NOV 2009) The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) uses the Central Contractor Registration database as its database for contractor information. Accordingly, the following requirements apply to this contract. (a) Definitions. As used in this clause ­ (1) "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information require or the conduct of business with the Government. (2) "Data Universal Number System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) "Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4-digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of
19

Solicitation No: CC12HQR0011 Page 20 of 55 the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying sub-units or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) "Registered in the CCR database" means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4, if applicable, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number has been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS+4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3) Failure to register in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award of an OCC contract. (4) Contractors will be registered in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet. However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days. Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. (End of Clause) H.7. 1052.222-8003 (OCC) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION (NOV 2009) All contractor personnel, regardless of whether or not they are working in an OCC facility, must complete the personal identity verification (PIV) process before beginning work under a contract. The PIV process is part of a larger process for initiating a background investigation, obtaining an OCC-issued security badge, and obtaining an HSPD-12-compliant security badge (referred to as
20

(d)

Solicitation No: CC12HQR0011 Page 21 of 55 a SmartID). Completing the PIV process is a prerequisite for obtaining an OCC-issued security badge and obtaining a SmartID. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will provide contractor personnel with an electronic PIV form. Contractor personnel must enter their name, telephone number, email address, employer's name, sponsor name, and contract number on the form and return it to the COR. Contractor personnel must provide additional information, including Social Security number, date of birth, and place of birth, to Critical Infrastructure Protection and Security (CIPS). CIPS will contact contractor personnel for the additional information. Contractor personnel must appear in person to complete the PIV process, at which time they must present two acceptable forms of identification and complete the PIV form. Requirements for acceptable forms of identification can be found at http://www.fedidcard.gov/deploytrain.aspx. See OCC Clause 1052.245-8007 for requirements regarding in-person appearances for security purposes. (End of Clause) H.8. 1052.242-8000 (OCC) EVALUATION OF CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE (DEC 2010) A. The OCC will evaluate the contractor's performance after contract award. If this contract has option periods, interim evaluations will be conducted at the end of each option period and then a final evaluation report will be prepared at the completion of the entire contract. If this contract does not have renewal options, an evaluation will be conducted upon completion of the contract. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Contracting Officer may conduct evaluations more or less frequently, if the Contracting Officer deems appropriate. B. Evaluations will be conducted using an electronic format as established by Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), an internet-based database of contractor performance information. The OCC will enter the information, gathered from the evaluation, into the CPARS. C. If the contractor responds to the evaluation, and the response rebuts any or all of the ratings, the Contracting Officer will attempt to reconcile the areas of disagreement with the contractor. If agreement cannot be reached, the evaluation and response shall be reviewed at a level higher than the Contracting Officer and a final evaluation will be issued by the reviewing official. If the reviewing official finds, either all or in part, against the contractor, the contractor's response shall become part of the final evaluation. The reviewing official's final decision shall not be subject to dispute under the terms and conditions of the Disputes clause or subject to resolution in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Alternative Dispute Resolution clause. The reviewing official will provide the contractor with a copy of the final evaluation.

21

Solicitation No: CC12HQR0011 Page 22 of 55 D. Any government agency authorized to access the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database will be able to view the performance information related to this contract. Any government agency may also receive a copy the contractor's performance evaluation, and any associated comments, by contacting the OCC. The OCC will also, upon request, provide copies of any and all of the contractor's evaluations to the contractor. (End of Clause) H.9. 1052.245-8002 (OCC) SEPARATION NOTIFICATION (SEP 2011) It is anticipated that during the performance of this contract, the contractor will replace key and non-key personnel who have access to OCC's network, information, resources or facilities. The COR or contractor employee shall initiate the off-boarding process for departing key and nonkey personnel in accordance with the terms of this clause. The COR or contractor employee shall access the Personnel and Administration Security System (PASS) and follow the instructions provided in the attachment (Attachment 3) to this contract to execute the off-boarding process for departing personnel. The off-boarding process shall be initiated at least two weeks prior to departure date or reassignment of contractor personnel who no longer require access to network, information, resources or facilities. If the contractor employee or agent departs without prior notification, then the COR shall initiate the off-boarding process within 24 hours of the departure. The contractor shall ensure that all Government property and information is returned to the OCC in accordance with the terms of the contract. It is the policy of OCC that all separating contractors complete the list of off-boarding activities appended to this contract as an attachment. Contractors must ensure that no government property, correspondence, or records, including classified or confidential material, are removed from the OCC. (End of Clause) H.10. 1052.245-8004 (OCC) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS (OCT 2008) All contractor personnel, regardless of whether or not they are working in an OCC facility must submit to a background investigation before beginning work under this contract. The number and type of investigations will depend on factors including, but not limited to, the length of time an individual will work on a contract, an individual's role, the sensitivity of information an individual will have access to, and the results of past investigations on an individual. Investigations typically conducted by the OCC include the National Agency Check (NAC), National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI), and full background investigations (BI). Contractor personnel must submit information for background investigations electronically through the e-QIP system (http://www.opm.gov/e-QIP/). Critical Infrastructure Protection and Security (CIPS) will notify contractor personnel when e-QIP is ready to receive their

22

Solicitation No: CC12HQR0011 Page 23 of 55 information. After submitting their information, contractor personnel must print required security forms from e-QIP. Printed forms must be signed and provided to CIPS. For background investigation purposes, contractor personnel are required to provide a set of fingerprints. Contractor personnel must appear in-person to provide fingerprints. See OCC Clause 1052.245-8007 for requirements regarding in-person appearances for security purposes. The results of all background investigations will be reviewed and adjudicated by CIPS. Based on investigation results, the OCC has the unilateral right to bar an individual from working under a contract or otherwise restrict the individual's role under a contract. The costs for all investigations required under this contract will be borne by the OCC. (End of Clause) H.11. 1052.245-8007 (OCC) In-PERSON APPEARANCES FOR SECURITY PURPOSES (OCT 2008) Contractor personnel must appear in person to: 1. Complete the personal identity verification (PIV) process 2. Have their fingerprint taken for a background investigation 3. Obtain an OCC-issued security badge 4. Enroll for an HSPD-12-compliant security badge (referred to as a SmartID) 5. Receive and activate a SmartID. Generally, one or more of these activities are completed during a single in-person appearance. An individual typically requires two in-person appearances to complete all tasks, but more inperson appearances may be required under some circumstances. The location at which contractor personnel must appear depends on the contract place of performance and security badge requirements. Generally, contractor personnel performing work in the Washington, DC area will be required to appear at the OCC Headquarters building. Contractor personnel working elsewhere will generally be required to appear at a USAccess credentialing center operated by the General Services Administration (GSA). (A list of GSAoperated credentialing centers can be found at http://www.fedidcard.gov/deployoss.aspx.) Contractor personnel requiring in person appearances at an OCC facility will schedule their appearance with the COR or an authorized representative. The COR or an authorized representative will escort contractor personnel while they are in the OCC facility. (End of Clause) H.12. 1052.243-8001 (OCC) AUTHORIZED CHANGES ONLY BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER (OCT 2008) (a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) below, no order, statement, or conduct of Government personnel who provide technical direction or in any other manner communicates with contractor
23

Solicitation No: CC12HQR0011 Page 24 of 55 personnel during the performance of this contract shall constitute a change under the "Changes" clause of this contract. (b) The contractor shall not comply with any order, direction or request of Government personnel unless it is issued in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer, or is pursuant to specific authority otherwise included as a part of this contract. (c) The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements of this contract and notwithstanding provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely the Contracting Officer's. In the event the contractor effects any change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in charges incurred as a result thereof. The address and telephone number of the Contracting Officer is: Name: Address: TBD 250 E Street SW Mail Stop FM-4 Washington, DC 20219-0001 (202) 874-XXX TBD@occ.treas.gov (End of Clause) H.13. 1052.342-8000 (OCC) Contractor's Commitment to Equal Opportunity in Employment and Contracting (APR 2012) Contractor confirms its commitment to equal opportunity in employment and contracting. To implement this commitment, the Contractor shall ensure, to the maximum extent possible consistent with applicable law, the fair inclusion of minorities and women in its workforce. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in all subcontracts under this Contract when the dollar value exceeds $150,000. Within ten (10) business days of a written request from the OCC's Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI), or such longer time as the OMWI determines, and without any additional consideration required from the Agency, the Contractor shall provide documentation, satisfactory to the Agency, of the actions it (and, as applicable, its subcontractors) has undertaken to demonstrate its good-faith efforts to comply with the aforementioned provisions. For purposes of this contract, "good-faith efforts" may include actions by the contractor intended to identify and, if present, remove barriers to minority and women employment or expansion of employment opportunities for minorities and women within its workforce. Efforts to remove such barriers may include, but are not limited to, recruiting minorities and women, providing job-related training, or engaging in other activities that could lead to those results.

Telephone: E-mail:

24

Solicitation No: CC12HQR0011 Page 25 of 55 The documentation requested by the OMWI may include, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: 1. A written affirmative action plan or other written program designed to ensure the fair inclusion of minorities and women in the contractor's workforce, including outreach, recruitment, and training efforts whereby the contractor sets forth specific, results-oriented policies and procedures. 2. A list of subcontract awards under the Contract categorized by dollar, date of award, and the subcontractor's ownership status, including whether the subcontractor is minority-owned (by race and/or ethnicity) or women-owned. 3. Documentation similar to that described in paragraph 1 with respect to each subcontractor. 4. Any other actions demonstrating the contractor's or subcontractor's good-faith efforts to include minorities and women in its workforce. Consistent with Section 342(c)(3) of the Dodd­Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (PL 111-203) (Dodd­Frank), a failure to demonstrate to the Director of the OMWI such good-faith efforts to include minorities and women in the Contractor's workforce (and, as applicable, the workforce of its subcontractors) may result in termination of the Contract for default, referral to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or other appropriate action. For purposes of this clause, the terms "minority," "minority-owned business" and "womenowned business" shall have the meanings set forth in Section 342(g) of Dodd­Frank.

Solicitation No: CC12HQR0011 Page 41 of 55 (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Factor 1: Technical Capability Factor 2: Past Performance Factor 3: Price Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Solicitation No: CC12HQR0011 Page 53 of 55 M.2.2 BASIS FOR AWARD The Government will select the best overall proposal, based upon an integrated assessment of all of the evaluation criteria as described in FAR 15.101-1. Offerors are cautioned that award will not necessarily be made to the lowest priced Offeror. Rather, in accordance with the concept of "best value", the government reserves the right to pay a price premium for a proposal that is superior under the non-price factors. However, as Offerors approach parity under the non-price factors, price may become a determinative factor in the award decision. The Government may incorporate various portions of the winning Offeror's proposal into the resulting contract. The Government reserves the right to make one award or no award, depending upon the quality of the proposals submitted, the availability of funds, and the estimated number of tasks. OCC will not, in any case, make award to an Offeror it considers to have substandard capabilities or unreasonable prices. M.2.3 COMPETITIVE RANGE Following the evaluation of the technical and price proposals, a competitive range determination may be made. This range will be comprised of the most highly rated offerors. The Government may also reduce the number of highly rated proposals within the competitive range for purposes of efficiency in accordance with FAR 15.306. Discussions will be conducted with all vendors within the competitive range. Following discussions, all Offerors still within the competitive range may be requested to submit a written Final Revised Proposal. Offerors may be eliminated from the competitive range at any time if they are found unacceptable in one or more evaluation factors. M.2.4 FINAL REVISED PROPOSALS If discussions are held, all Offerors still within the competitive range may be requested to submit a written Final Revised Proposal. Following the evaluation of the final revised proposal, the Government will make award to the Offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government, considering price and other related factors in accordance with the evaluation criteria. M.2.5 EVALUATION FACTORS The Government will evaluate all proposals against the following factors listed in descending order of importance. Factor 1- Technical Capability Technical capability shall be evaluated to determine whether the offeror clearly demonstrates technical experience, technical understanding, and approach to this project as it relates to the PWS objectives and tasks. The Government will evaluate the suitability of the offeror's
53

Solicitation No: CC12HQR0011 Page 54 of 55 proposed solution for the tasks and assess the quality of the solution, likelihood of the solution's success, inherent risk, methodology for approaching the solution, and overall understanding of the requirements. The Government will assess the offeror's ability to provide a complete and integrated solution to the full scope and breadth of the PWS requirements and the adequacy of the offeror's data quality management plan to ensure quality controls are in place, which satisfy the Government's stated Performance Requirements Summary and will result in tasks completed in a timely and satisfactory manner. The Government will evaluate each offeror's company experience on the basis of its breadth, depth and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective contract(s), based on the experience information provided by the offeror. Factor 2 ­ Past Performance The Government will evaluate the offeror's recent and relevant past performance in performing tasks related to the PWS. The offeror will be evaluated on the quality of its past performance on similar work, including customer satisfaction, cost control, timeliness of performance, and effectiveness at accomplishing stated goals. If the offeror does not have a record of relevant past performance, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, and will receive a rating of Neutral. The offeror will be given an opportunity to comment on third party past performance information, which it has not seen. Factor 3 ­ Price Price will be evaluated but not point scored. The Government will evaluate the total price proposed for each performance period (i.e. base and all option years) to determine price reasonableness as it relates to the technical requirements and to assist in the best value determination. The individual CLIN prices will also be evaluated to determine whether the prices are reasonable and balanced. The Government reserves the right to reject an offer that contains unbalanced pricing pursuant to FAR 15.404-1 (g) (3). Section 508 Compliance Reviews Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (VPAT referenced in Section L) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration. (a) The vendor shall submit a self-assessment on how the proposed product and/or services meet each of the technical standards and functional performance criteria and may be requested to provide temporary access to active systems for review. The OCC will evaluate the contractor's proposed services and/or products to determine how each meets accessibility requirements. (b) To be considered eligible for award, respondent must propose goods and/or services that meet the applicable provisions of the accessibility requirements. Alternatively, offerors may propose goods or services that provide equivalent facilitation defined in 36 CFR 1194.5. Such offer will be considered to have met the accessibility requirements for the feature or component
54

Solicitation No: CC12HQR0011 Page 55 of 55 providing equivalent facilitation by ensuring and demonstrating equal or greater access to individuals with disabilities, as compared to the access available to individuals without disabilities has been met. (c) If none of the offers meet all applicable standards of the accessibility requirements, those respondents whose products or services meet some of the applicable standards will be considered eligible for award and evaluated to determine which quote best meets the applicable standards. Those offerors who meets the OCC's technical requirements and fully meet the Section 508 requirements will be considered for the award. (d) Award will not be made to a respondent meeting all or some of the applicable Accessibility requirements if award would impose an undue burden upon the agency. M.2.6 DISCUSSIONS The Government anticipates that discussions will be conducted during this procurement with all offerors determined to be within the competitive range (See Federal Acquisition Regulation 15.306). However, the Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Discussions will likely be in the form of written questions requiring written responses from each offeror, and may include face-to-face meetings or telephonic discussions. Discussions will culminate with a request for final proposal revision from those offerors who remain in the competitive range. If, after discussions have begun, an offeror originally in the competitive range is no longer considered to be among the most highly rated offerors being considered for award, that offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306 (d) (5)

Attachment 4 Solicitation No. CC12HQR0011 CONDITIONAL ACCESS TO SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT I, ______________________, hereby consent to the terms in this Agreement in consideration of my being granted conditional access to certain United States Government documents or material containing sensitive but unclassified information. I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions: 1. By being granted conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is any information, the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or unauthorized disclosure or modification of which could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs including information covered by 18 U.S.C.  1905 and 1906, or the proprietary interests of national banks or their customers or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Title 5 U.S.C.  552a, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. I am being granted conditional access contingent upon my execution of this Agreement for the sole purpose of work performed under Contract #Tcc-XX-HQ-X-XXXX. This approval will permit me conditional access to certain information, including but not limited to, documents, memoranda, reports and/or to attend meetings in which such information is discussed or otherwise made available to me. This Agreement will not allow me access to materials which the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has predetermined, in its sole discretion, is inappropriate for disclosure pursuant to this Agreement. This may include sensitive but unclassified information provided to the OCC by other agencies of the United States Government. I will never divulge any sensitive but unclassified information which is provided to me pursuant to this Agreement to any person, unless I have been advised in writing by the OCC that the individual is authorized to receive it. Unless expressly authorized by the OCC, I will not use any sensitive but unclassified information for any commercial or other purpose other than that for which access to such information is provided under Contract # Tcc-XX-HQ-X-XXXX. I agree that I must seek and obtain the prior written approval of the OCC for any proposed disclosure or use. Additionally, I will submit to the OCC for security review, prior to any submission for publication, any book, article, column or other written work for general publication that is based upon any knowledge I obtained during the course of my work on Contract # Tcc-XX-HQ-X-XXXX in order for the OCC to ensure that no sensitive but unclassified information is disclosed. 5. I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of sensitive but unclassified information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement. If I am permitted, at the sole discretion of the OCC, to review any official documents containing sensitive but unclassified information, such review will be conducted at a secure facility or under circumstances which will maintain the security protection of such material. I will not be permitted to and will not make any copies of documents or parts of documents to which conditional access is granted to me. Any notes taken during the course of such access will remain at the OCC to be placed in secure storage unless it is determined by OCC officials that the notes contain no sensitive but unclassified information. If I wish to have the notes released to me, OCC officials will review the notes for purposes of deleting any sensitive but unclassified information to create a redacted copy of the notes. If I do not wish a review of any notes that I make, those notes will remain sealed in secure storage at the OCC.

7. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I understand that the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive but unclassified information could compromise the mission and security of the OCC. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information. This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to OCC information, both classified and sensitive but unclassified, in the future. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the United States may institute a civil action for damages or any other appropriate relief. The willful disclosure of information to which I have agreed therein not to divulge may constitute a criminal offense. Unless and until I am provided a written release by the OCC from this Agreement or any portions of it, all conditions and obligations contained in this Agreement apply both during my period of conditional access, which shall terminate at the conclusion of my work on Contract # Tcc-XX-HQ-X-XXXX, and at all times thereafter.

10. Each provision of this Agreement is severable. If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. 11. I understand that the United States Government may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement, including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting use or disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement. 12. By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government does not waive any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that it may assert in any administrative or court proceedings to protect any sensitive but unclassified information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement. 13. These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with , or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights or liabilities created by Executive order 12356; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health and safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 U.S.C. 421 et seq.)(governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents), and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. Section 783(b)). The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions and liabilities created by the Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this Agreement and are controlling. 14. My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or nondisclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government. 15. I make this Agreement in good faith, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.
