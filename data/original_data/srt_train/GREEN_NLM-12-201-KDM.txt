Section 508 Evaluation Template   5







                                           HHS Guide to Completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template

Purpose:

This document provides Vendors with instructions on completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template for the US Department of Health and Human
Services


Background:

In 2001, the Information Technology Industry Council partnered with the General Services Administration to create a tool that would assist
Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements specified in Section 508.  The result of their
collaboration was the 508 Evaluation Template – a simple, web-based checklist that allows Vendors to document how their product did or did not
meet the various Section 508 Requirements.


How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized:

This template is also known as the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)

The Section 508 Evaluation Template consists of a long series of tables.  The Summary Table is used to provide a sense of your product’s overall
“level-of-conformance” with the Section 508 Standards.  Subsequently, the Section 1194.xx Tables contain the detailed subparagraphs that a
Section 508 Standard is composed of.  It is within these Section 1194.xx Tables that you will define in detail how your product did or did not
comply with a specific requirement.

                                                            Understanding the columns

Use the following to understand the use of the three columns in the Section 508 Evaluation Template’s tables:

|Summary Table                                                                                                                                                       |

                                        Typical Scenario for Completing a Section 508 Evaluation Template:

To complete the Section 508 Evaluation Template, enlist the services of your company’s technical specialist for the product being sought for
purchase.  HHS requires a measure of technical detail in the responses.  Once you have enlisted their assistance:

   1) Determine which sections of the Technical Standards (Subpart B-1194.21-26) apply to your product.* Keep in mind that you always must
      complete the Functional Performance Criteria (Subpart C – 1194.31) and Information, Documentation, and Support (Subpart D – 1194.41)
      sections of the Section 508 Evaluation Template.

   2) For each section that applies, determine if the product does or does not meet the specific Criteria elements.

   3) Using the information found in the How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized section, document in the Section 1194.xx Tables
      exactly how your product did or did not meet the applicable standard.


         • If the product supports the standard, provide detailed examples of what accessibility features exist and how they are used to support
           the standard.

         • If the product does not support the standard, remember that Section 508 allows products to meet the Access Board Standards in
           innovative, non-traditional ways. The product can meet the standard by providing an innovative solution, as long as the feature
           performs in the same manner as it does for any other user without a disability.


         • If the product does not possess an innovative, non-traditional way of supporting the standard, provide detailed examples of exactly
           how the product did not meet the standard.


   4) Once documented in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how the product did or did not meet, return to the Summary Table and document the
      product’s overall “level-of-conformance” in each of the applicable sections.


   5) Post the final Section 508 Evaluation Template on your company's web site or on the GSA Buy Accessible Wizard.


   6) It is the Vendor's responsibility to maintain the integrity of the data on the Section 508 Evaluation Template. The information provided on
      the Section 508 Evaluation Template is considered a self-representation unless expressly affirmed otherwise. Even so, HHS uses this form to
      complete required Market Research associated with the agency complying with Section 508 and may use the form to eliminate this product
      compared to other more accessible products that meet the HHS business needs.

      * Please Note:  Any WEB application being purchased by HHS also requires the Vendor to complete Section 1194.21 of the Section 508
      Evaluation Template in addition to Sections 1194.22, 1194.31, and 1194.41.


    • HHS reserves the right to reject a PAT and corresponding proposal/offering if the answers do not address the standards.  HHS needs the PAT
      to address the standards in order to evaluate it for conformance.

    • Please answer honestly and be prepared to work with HHS to improve accessibility for your product if it is purchased.


    • Submission of this documentation constitutes a warrant on behalf of the vendor of the conformance of their product.  Remediation of a
      product or service to the specified conformance shall be the responsibility of the vendor.

Approval Signature (CIT Training approving official)






Vendor Policy



CIT Training sessions (including courses and seminars) must focus strictly on the technical aspects of the application and cannot be viewed as a marketing opportunity.  CIT welcomes vendor participation and believes it accelerates progress in research, synergizes strengths to overcome gaps, and fosters alliances to advance the nation’s biomedical research.  CIT Training is committed to working with vendors as volunteer instructors to ensure an overall positive training experience for NIH staff.   The following Vendor Policy applies.



All CIT Training classes are advertised monthly so that new classes can be announced and classes with low enrollment can be increased.



At any time, CIT Training or the instructor (must contact CIT Training) may cancel/reschedule a training session. This could be due to low enrollment, illness, etc. 



All marketing for upcoming sessions will be handled by CIT Training.



CIT Training reserves the right to decline a vendor’s training proposal.



Registration

The official record of registration is through the CIT Training website (). The vendor will allow students to enter the classroom freely.  Attendance will be monitored by CIT Training personnel to ensure that the appropriate students are taking the session. The session roster will not be shared with the vendor.



Vendors may post the session on their website provided the registration points to the CIT Training website ().  



Training Sessions



Vendors shall sign the Agreement – Use of CIT Training Facilities by Non-Federal Sources prior to using CIT training facilities.



Vendors are allowed to speak for 1.5 minutes about their organization, but shall not market or sell their services/products in any way during the training sessions.



The use of tracking software is not permitted in any electronic communications or website distributed or administered by the vendor. 



Use of a non-NIH computer to facilitate training or instructions is authorized as long as the system has antivirus software installed and is up-to-date with all required security patches.



Providing refreshments during a CIT Training seminar is not permitted.



If training is to take place online, CIT Training has the permission to record the session and provide it to the NIH community.  If vendors wish to use the recorded session for their own use, it must be agreed upon by CIT Training ahead of time.



Vendors are not permitted to require NIH staff to provide contact information at any point during the session. A sheet of paper may be passed around or placed at the front table asking staff if they would like to receive future information. This student contact information must be freely provided free at their own will. Unsolicited e-mails to NIH staff are prohibited.



Gifts

Outlined in Chapter 1135 of the NIH Manual.



Promotional and Informational Material

Vendors are not permitted to post any type of printed or handwritten material, advertisements, signs or other such promotional materials anywhere on NIH premises to include public areas, cafeterias or lounges without prior approval.


Vendors may not send marketing or promotional e-mails regarding their class directly to NIH staff. 



If a vendor is interested in receiving feedback before a session begins, they must submit language to CIT Training for review and approval to determine if the content is appropriate for distribution to NIH personnel. This language must be submitted to  no later than one week before the class date.  CIT Training will distribute, compile comments, and return to the vendor.



If a vendor wishes to supply educational material, it must be reviewed and approved by CIT Training before any distribution may occur.



Compliance 

The terms and conditions of this Vendor Policy must be strictly followed by vendors and their representatives. 

CIT Training staff will assist in monitoring the level of compliance and will report any violations to CIT management. 

Based on the seriousness of any violation of this Vendor Policy, the resultant action may include one or more of the following:



 verbal and written reinforcement of the Vendor Policy during the training session;

cancellation of currently scheduled sessions; and

denial of any future sessions through CIT Training.

The offeror is encouraged to prepare their proposal using either "Hard Metric," "Soft Metric," or "Dual Systems" of measurement. The following definitions are provided for your information:

 Hard Metric – The replacement of a standard inch-pound size with an accepted metric size for a particular purpose. An example of size substitution might be: selling or packaging liquids by the liter instead of by the pint or quart (as for soft drinks), or instead of by the gallon (as for gasoline).

 Soft Metric – The result of a mathematical conversion of inch-pound measurements to metric equivalents for a particular purpose. The physical characteristics are not changed.

9.	Privacy Act – Treatment of Proposal Information



The Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information, the authority which authorizes the solicitation, whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, the principal purpose for which the information is intended to be used, the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information, and the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.



The NIH is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Sec. 301(a)(7) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.



Providing the information requested is entirely voluntary.  The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.



Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.



In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals are requested to disclose their social security number.



Provision of the social security number is voluntary.

The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:



•	To the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Office for auditing.

•	To the Department of Justice as required for litigation.

•	To respond to congressional inquiries.

•	To qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees, for opinions as 	a part of the review process.



10.	Selection of Offerors



You are advised that an award of a contract will be made to the offeror that the Government determines to represent the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (i.e., price, special features, administrative costs) to meet the Government’s needs.  The evaluation criteria to be used by the Government are described in SECTION M, EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD, below.



11.	Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility, HHSAR 	352.239-73(a) 	(January 2010)



Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility, Section 508 Compliance is applicable to this solicitation and the following information is provided to assist in proposal preparation.

  
IMPORTANT NOTE TO OFFERORS:  The following information shall be addressed in a separate section of the Technical Proposal, entitled, "Section 508 Compliance". 



 Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility, HHSAR 352.239-73(a) (January 2010)



		a.	Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as 					amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural 				and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information 			(EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an 				exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, 				maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit--


		1.	Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use 				information and data that is comparable to the access and use of 				information and data by Federal employees who are not 					individuals with disabilities; and



		2.	Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or 				services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of 				information and data that is comparable to the access and use of 				information and data by members of the public who are not 				individuals with disabilities.
 

		b.	Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotations/bid in response 				to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT 				accessibility standards.  Information about Section 508 visions is available 			at. The complete text of Section 508 Final 				Provisions can be accessed at.
 

		c.	The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are:



		1194.21	Software applications and operating systems

		1194.22	Web-based Intranet and Internet information and 					applications



In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard.  Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability Web site ().
 

		d.	Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed 				information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards 				conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are 			incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 				508 requirements.  If a vendor claims its products or services, including 				EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet 					applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS 				Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by 				the Government -- i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or 				services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards 				in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or 				services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product 				Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its 			expense.



	(End of provision) 



	The HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template is included in Section J of 	this solicitation.

At the discretion of the contracting officer, an offeror(s) may be invited to provide an oral presentation to the Government after the Government completes its initial evaluation of its proposal.

SECTION M:	EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD



A.	GENERAL



The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include technical (which encompasses experience and past performance factors) and cost/price factors.  Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the Contract, cost/price is also a consideration in the overall contract award decision.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  In any case, the Government will make an award(s) to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.



The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the proposed staff in relation to the fulfillment of the requirements as set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW) and the RFP.    Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below.  



B.	MANDATORY QUALIFICATION CRITERIA



	None



C.	EVALUATION OF OPTIONS



It is anticipated that any contract awarded from this solicitation will contain option provision(s) and period(s).  



In accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (July 1990), the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement, except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).



D.	TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA



The evaluation criteria are used by the Technical Evaluation Group (TEG) when reviewing each offeror’s technical proposal.  The criteria below are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes.



In determining which offer represents the best value (i.e., experience and expertise, past performance, labor hours, other direct costs, and administrative costs) to meet the Government’s needs, the Government shall evaluate responses using the following evaluation criteria:



1.	Experience and Expertise of Proposed Staff (70%)



The offeror’s staff will be evaluated based on a review of its descriptions of proposed personnel, as well as submitted resumes, and “Letters of Commitment” and its ability to illustrate an appropriate skill mix to accomplish the tasks and objectives set forth in the Statement of Work.



Significant weight under this technical evaluation criterion will be assigned to an offeror’s ability to provide staff who possess demonstrated knowledge and experience to successfully perform the software engineering services for the SCS OnDemand software as specified in the Statement of Work.



The Government may conduct reference checks in order to determine the past performance of the offeror’s proposed staff under acquisitions similar to this solicitation.

SCS OnDemand Maintenance and Support 



(03-13-2012)



1.0	PURPOSE



The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to acquire professional Information Technology (IT) services to assist the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), in the maintenance and support of the Scientific Coding System (SCS) OnDemand.  SCS OnDemand is an NIH Enterprise Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) IT solution.  



The professional IT services specified in this SOW are being acquired under the ordering procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.



2.0	BACKGROUND



The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the world’s premier medical research organization.  An agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, the NIH is the steward of medical and behavioral research for the Nation.  Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.  The NIH is comprised of the Office of the Director (OD) and 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) that provide leadership and direction to programs designed to improve the health of the Nation by conducting and supporting research: in the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases; in the process of human growth and development; in the biological effects of environmental contaminants; in the understanding of mental, addictive and physical disorders; in directing programs for the collection, dissemination, and exchange of information in medicine and health, including the development and support of medical libraries and the training of medical librarians and other health information specialists.   Extramural grants account for approximately 83 percent of NIH's multi-billion dollar budget. These are awarded to investigators throughout the U.S. and abroad. Approximately 10 percent of the NIH budget supports NIH intramural investigators who also conduct research.   

  

NIH enjoys a great deal of respect from the Congress and the public, and takes its stewardship of appropriated research dollars very seriously.  Seeking high efficiency and accountability in its administrative operations, and influenced by recent legislation mandating increased attention to careful accounting and performance-based programs, NIH continues to update both its internal business and logistics processes and the technology that underlies and supports those processes.



CIT’s Division of Enterprise and Custom Applications (DECA) supports the NIH enterprise by providing IT services for scientific research initiatives, administrative and business entities, and NIH infrastructure.  DECA provides skilled resources to be used for program and project management support, systems analysis, programming, subject matter expertise and database administration to the NIH ICs and other federal agencies, as well as consulting services to the NIH.  This includes expanded IT program support for bioinformatics and other scientific research initiatives at several NIH Institutes.

  

DECA provides a wide range of management oversight and computer systems development services in support of both scientific research and administrative missions at the NIH on a fee-for-service basis.  These service offerings include enterprise application support, custom application development, application monitoring, enterprise authentication, website design and development, web content management, portal gateway, program and project management, communications management, and quality assurance.



3.0	PROJECT HISTORY



The administration and management of the NIH portfolio of research initiatives, which includes grants, contracts, intramural projects, interagency agreements, etc., requires the collective efforts of all of the NIH ICs.  Each IC has the responsibility of managing its respective portfolio.  To monitor and track funding, the NIH Office of the Director (OD) defines specific disease area (scientific) reporting categories by which each IC is required to report.  However, many ICs have extended the use of this required scientific coding model, and have further refined and expanded their scientific coding to be more IC specific as related to their research portfolio.  This IC specific scientific coding is used to identify gaps and opportunities in an IC’s research portfolio, and for internal tracking and funds allocation of scientific initiatives.    



In an effort to better meet their ever-changing business need for efficient and accurate scientific coding, many ICs have subscribed to the Scientific Coding System (SCS) OnDemand.  The SCS OnDemand is a comprehensive web-based IT solution which facilitates the scientific coding of NIH grants, contracts, intramural projects, and interagency agreements.  Introduced in 2004 as a cost recovery subscription service, this shared effort among the NIH IC subscribers provides greater information standardization, functions as an IMPAC extension system, categorizes scientific areas that are the primary focus of an IC, and addresses the individual grants tracking, coding, budgeting, and reporting needs of each specific IC.



Utilizing a common code base, SCS OnDemand is able to provide specific functionality to each IC, thus satisfying the IC’s individual scientific, administrative, and financial requirements from a base application.  SCS OnDemand provides a routine download from the NIH IMPAC system, a seamless interface with QVR, and reporting on both RCDC and ARRA dollars.  



CIT, which provides, coordinates, and manages information technology within the NIH, introduced the SCS OnDemand application in 2004 as an NIH Enterprise Government Off–the-Shelf (GOTS) IT solution.  The initial base IT solution was developed by Altum, Inc., and was individually utilized by some ICs at the NIH.  On behalf of the NIH ICs, CIT managed the consolidation of the many IC specific instances of the Altum initial product.  Through acquired professional IT services from that company, further customization of the consolidated IT solution resulted in the current enterprise scientific coding and reporting system, SCS OnDemand v3.10, the intellectual rights to which is owned by the Government pursuant to FAR Clause 52.227-17, Rights in Data – Special Works (December 2007).      



The SCS OnDemand Change Control Board (CCB) is an integral part of the formal change process and is the approval authority controlling application functional changes.  The CCB ensures that a structured process is used to consider proposed changes and/or enhancements, and incorporate them into a specified release of the SCS OnDemand.  The CCB is responsible for identifying, reviewing, approving, prioritizing and managing changes and/or enhancements proposed by the participating NIH ICs and the contractor to further enhance the SCS OnDemand application.  

    

The SCS OnDemand application has been proven to provide the following strategic benefits by:

  

Avoiding significant costs through the consolidation of  application infrastructure and data storage;

Complying with the NIH Enterprise Architecture and the requirements in OMB Circulars A-130 and A-11;

Facilitating NIH-wide reporting while retaining data ownership at the IC level;

Providing a standard mechanism for collaboration of scientific coding, definitions, and best practices across ICs;

Providing ICs immediate access to IRDB data and reducing server load due to the elimination of frequent downloads; and

Utilizing existing CIT infrastructure, including web, database, and other enterprise 3rd party tools.  



This system, coupled with existing CIT and the Office of Extramural Research (OER) resources, delivers a beneficial solution that can be successfully used by all NIH ICs regardless of the size or value of their grants portfolio.

At least 30 days prior to diverting any of the specified individuals to other programs or contracts (or as soon as possible, if an individual must be replaced, for example, as a result of leaving the employ of the Contractor), the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer and shall submit comprehensive justification for the diversion or replacement request (including proposed substitutions for key personnel) to permit evaluation by the Government of the impact on performance under this Contract.  The Contractor shall not divert or otherwise replace any key personnel without the written consent of the Contracting Officer.  The Government may modify the contract to add or delete key personnel at the request of the Contractor or Government.



(End of Clause)

















The following individuals are considered to be essential to the work being performed hereunder:









18.0	NON-PERSONAL SERVICES AND INHERENTLY GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS



Pursuant to FAR 37.1, no personal services shall be performed under this SOW.  All work requirements shall flow only from the COTR to the Contractor Project Manager.  No Contractor employee will be directly supervised by the Government.  All individual employee assignments, and daily work direction, shall be given by the applicable Contractor supervisor.  If the Contractor believes any Government action or communication has been given that would create a personal services relationship between the Government and any Contractor employee, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of this communication or action.



Pursuant to FAR 7.5, the Contractor shall not perform any inherently governmental actions under this SOW.  No Contractor employee shall hold him or herself out to be a Government employee, agent, or representative.  No Contractor employee shall state orally or in writing at any time that he or she is acting on behalf of the Government.  In all communications with third parties in connection with this SOW, Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractor employees and specify the name of the company for which they work.  In all communications with other Government contractors in connection with this SOW, the Contractor employee shall state that they have no authority to in any way change this SOW and that if the other contractor believes this communication to be a direction to change their contract, they should notify the Contracting Officer for that contract and not carry out the direction until a clarification has been issued by the Contracting Officer.



The Contractor shall insure that all of its employees working on this SOW are informed of the substance of this article.  Nothing in this article shall limit the Government’s rights in any way under the other provisions of this SOW, including those related to the Government’s right to inspect and accept the services to be performed under this SOW.  The substance of this article shall be included in all subcontracts at any tier.



19.0	ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST



Purpose:  The purpose of this article is to ensure that the Contractor (1) is not biased because of its financial, contractual, organizational, or other interest which relate to the work under this Contract, and (2) does not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this Contract.



Scope:  The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the Contractor and any of its affiliates or their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Contractor") in activities covered by this article as a prime contractor, subcontractor, cosponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity.  For the purpose of this article, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another concern or when a third party has the power to control both concerns.



"Organizational conflict of interest" (FAR Subpart 9.5) means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage (FAR 2.101).  An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on an instant contract, or when the nature of the work to be performed on the instant contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition (FAR 9.502(c)).



Because of the unusual nature of the work performed under this Contract, and the fact that the Contractor will have access from time to time to sensitive Government information, and because some of the work will be performed in Government facilities, the Government must maintain a special, close relationship with the Contractor and the Contractor's personnel in various important areas.



The Contractor shall not use this privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector.



The Contractor is required to conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government, to operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence, to be free from organizational conflicts of interest, and to have full disclosure of its affairs to the sponsoring agency.



The Contractor shall be ineligible to participate in any capacity in contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefore (solicited and unsolicited) which stem directly from the Contractor's performance of work under this contract for a period of one (1) year after the completion of this Contract, except as provided hereinafter.



If, under this Contract, the Contractor prepares a complete or essentially complete statement of work or specifications to be used in competitive acquisitions, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort that is based on such statement of work or specifications.  The Contractor shall not incorporate its products or services in such statement of work or specifications unless approved in writing by the Contracting Officer, in which case the restriction in this subparagraph shall not apply.



It is imperative that the Contractor be proactive in order to avoid organizational conflicts of interest.  The Contractor shall take all reasonable measures to assure that organizational conflicts of interest do not occur.  As part of the Contractor's efforts to avoid organizational conflict of interest situations, the Contractor shall inform the Government of any actual, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest.  The Contractor is responsible for providing a detailed written report of actual, potential, or apparent organizational conflicts of interest to the Contracting Officer as soon as the circumstance is known, describing the conflict and how the Contractor plans to resolve the problem.



Subcontracts:  The Contractor shall include an article, substantially similar to this article, in subcontracts involving the performance of advisory and assistance services as that term is defined at FAR 37.201.  The terms "contract," "contractor," and "contracting officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.



20.0	RIGHTS IN DATA



The Contractor agrees that upon completion (or termination with or without cause) of this Contract, it shall have no property or possessor rights to any of the correspondence, files, or materials of whatever kind or description, or any copies or duplicates of such, whether developed or prepared by it or furnished to it by the Government in connection with the performance of this Contract; and that upon demand it shall surrender immediately to the Contracting Officer such items, matters, materials, and copies. 



The Contractor shall not provide any Government documents, information or licensed material in any form to sources not authorized by the Government, during or after performance of this Contract, without the written approval of the COTR.



All data/information first produced as a result of performing task assignments under this Contract shall become the Federal Government’s property and the Contractor shall surrender any and all rights to its ownership.  To this end, the Contractor hereby agrees to accept the terms and conditions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.227-17, Rights in Data – Special Works (December 2007), which is incorporated into this Contract by reference.



For purposes of this Contract, the FAR 52.227-17, Rights in Data – Special Works (December 2007) clause supersedes the FAR 52.227- 14, Rights in Data – General (December 2007) clause.



21.0	ACCESS TO NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) ELECTRONIC MAIL



All Contractor staff that have access to and use of HHS electronic mail (e-mail) must identify themselves as contractors on all outgoing e-mail messages, including those that are sent in reply or are forwarded to another user.  To best comply with this requirement, the Contractor staff shall set up an e-mail signature (“AutoSignature”) or an electronic business card (“V-card”) on each contractor employee’s computer system and/or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) that will automatically display “Contractor” in the signature area of all e-mails sent.









22.0	ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY HHSAR 352.239-73(b) (January 2010)



Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194.  Information about Section 508 provisions is available at.  The complete text of Section 508 Final provisions can be accessed at.

The COTR will assign the applicable Section 508 standard to each task assignment.



The Contractor must provide a written Section 508 conformance certification due at the end of each contract/order exceeding $100,000 when the contract/order duration is one year or less.  If it is determined by the Government that EIT products and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the Contractor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense.


In the event of a modification(s) to this contract/order, which adds new EIT products or services or revises the type of, or specifications for, products or services the Contractor is to provide, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor submit a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template to assist the Government in determining that the EIT products or services support Section 508 accessibility standards.  Instructions for documenting accessibility via the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability Web site ().

[(End of HHSAR 352.239-73(b)]


Prior to the Contracting Officer exercising an option for a subsequent performance period/additional quantity or adding funding for a subsequent performance period under this contract, as applicable, the Contractor must provide a Section 508 Annual Report to the Contracting Officer and COTR.  Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer in writing, the Contractor shall provide the cited report in accordance with the following schedule.  Instructions for completing the report are available in the Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability Web site under the heading Vendor Information and Documents. The Contractor's failure to submit a timely and properly completed report may jeopardize the Contracting Officer's exercising an option or adding funding, as applicable.
