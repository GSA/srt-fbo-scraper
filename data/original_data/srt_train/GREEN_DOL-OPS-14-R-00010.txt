BuyAccessible Government Product / Service Accessibility Template (GPAT)

 

Section 508 (http://section508.gov/section508-policies)requires that federal agencies electronic and information technology is accessible to people with disabilities. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. 

 

Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) (http://section508.gov/Section-508-Of-The-Rehabilitation-Act) are determined as applicable to this acquisition based on the following technical provisions: To understand the technical standards that apply to each provision, the respondent should refer to http://Section 508.gov at http://section508.gov/summary-section508-standards. 

 

This GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable Section 508 requirements. 

 

NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard. Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for this acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information. 

 

The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding to the six technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables correspond to accessibility information about information content deliverables and labor hours, respectively. 

 

Please fill the information below as a part of request for accessibility information of your proposed deliverable.

ETA-Office of Apprenticeship





25 July 2014








Background

The mission of the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is to contribute to a more efficient function of the U.S. labor market by providing high quality job training, employment, labor market information, and income maintenance services.  ETA carries these out primarily through state and local workforce development systems.  



The Office of Information Systems and Technology (OIST) is the ETA’s central organization for information technology resources.  The OIST Enterprise Solution Services (ESS) Division is the technical authority and program manager for OIST, responsible for the technical planning, policies, acquisition, management, maintenance, and delivery of all ETA applications. 



OIST/ESS is seeking experienced Contractors to provide ongoing deliverables for project management, application development, operations and maintenance (O&M), data warehousing, and systems integration for the ETA IT Modernization project starting with the Office of Apprenticeship (OA).   This Contract defines the scope of Contractor deliverables required to support the OIST/ESS mission to effectively manage, maintain and improve ETA’s enterprise technology services associated with the Office of Apprenticeship Modernization (OAM) of apprenticeship technology solutions.



Scope

OAM is a proposed information technology (IT) solution to advance into the 21st century and implement an ambitious plan to double the number of apprentices within the next five (5) years.  The Registered Apprenticeship IT system, must upgrade IT tools and infrastructure to increase program efficiency and enhance accountability. The use of a cloud-based and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Business Process Management (BPM) software product with the strong capabilities are desired to automate a number of time consuming work processes and become the backbone of a modernized IT infrastructure. The desired solution will integrate customer relations management (CRM) software, E-registration, Case Management and Reporting. Overall, the goal is to provide a Business Process Service solution capable of modernizing and displacing the services offered by the existing legacy Registered Apprenticeship Partners Information Data System (RAPIDS) in a cloud environment that will improve accessibility for stakeholders.



The scope of this Contract is to provide contract support for approved and funded projects for the full scope of the software development lifecycle associated with modernizing the OA system in the cloud inclusive requirements gathering, network operations, system design, application development, security, data warehousing, and systems integration.



Type of Contract

The Government anticipates award of a single Indefinite Delivery- Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with both Firm-Fixed Price and Labor Hour with Fixed Hourly Price Task Orders.



Objectives

The ETA seeks to modernize the current application architecture with additional technology capabilities within the cloud.  The Office of Apprenticeship, one program office within ETA, wishes to utilize this new technology platform to resolve current system issues.  By using a modern commercial off the shelf (COTS) products like a BPM tool, an automated solution can be developed that will accomplish what the program needs, while at the same time being easily modifiable when a program needs change.  This will reduce the cost of development and maintenance, amongst providing other benefits which OA can utilize. 



The President’s goal is to double the number of apprenticeships in the United States over the next five years.   On September 30, 2013, RAPIDS contained 203,060 (55%) of the 375,425 active apprenticeships across the government.



The current state of the OA RAPIDS Product can be described as an antique quilt-like patchwork of complex custom code suffering from platform maintenance neglect and resource deprivation. Program Administration funding currently provides the equivalent of one contract resource across many labor categories to provide only critical O&M support.  The custom code makes it difficult for updates to the system to occur.  As a result, there are currently over 200 items within the backlog (items that have been requested but not implemented) for this legacy application.



One of these critical backlog items is implementation of an automated process for building standards for apprenticeship programs.  Today, this process involves an Apprenticeship Training Representatives (ATR) manually working with a program sponsor by phone and written document to develop an approved apprenticeship program.  This manual process is time consuming and prone to errors and can take anywhere from 1 month to 4 months to complete the development of one standard.  By implementing technology to help with this process, the program office seeks to decrease the time required to develop and approve a standard from a maximum of four months to a maximum of 2 – 3 weeks.



OA also would like the ability for Program Sponsors (businesses, etc.) who are interested in starting apprenticeship programs to be able to visit a public site, enter their information and receive contact from the Apprenticeship Office.



The proposed solution directly supports ETA’s mission by automating and streamlining the sponsorship program creation process using an agile development methodology.  



The BPM solution will be provided accompanying a cloud architecture which it will be hosted on, which allow better scalability, reliability, and cost benefits over the current system architecture.



With a new system, OA will be able to better attract cutting edge industries and employers; supply online e-tools to improve customer experience, and create efficiencies in conducting business.



The Office of Information Systems and Technology (OIST) is responsible for the technical planning, design, development, integration, testing, delivery, management and maintenance of all of all ETA solution services.  There are several groups within OIST that help to facilitate this objective – each with a Federal Project Manager role on this project:

Enterprise Solutions and Services (Program Management Office and Technology Services)

Governance (Quality Assurance, Configuration Management and Security)

Network Operations (Database Management, Network Operations, and Webserver Administration)

provides LAN/WAN support to National and Regional Office locations within ETA, as well as support for Internet Connectivity through DOL’s MTIPS (Managed Trusted Internet Provider Service).   
For this project, these functions for all onsite DOL-ETA Network and Internet related activities will continue to be performed and monitored by The ETA-OIST Network Operations Team.  The ETA-OIST Network Operations Team will be the interface for all onsite LAN/WAN and Internet related activities dealing with this project.  

The scope of the Network Operations Team in reference to this project ends at the internet demarcation point for ETA.  All activities outside of this demarcation point are the responsibility of the Contractor including any Service Level Agreements or commitments made.  The Contractor will coordinate and or work with The ETA-OIST Network Operations team when necessary for items requiring collaboration or interaction.

52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items. (JAN 1999)



 Addendum to 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)



 A.  BASIS FOR AWARD.  The Government will award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government based on the best overall proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the Four (4) evaluation factors: {Technical, Section 508, Past Performance, and Price}.  Factor I, Technical is approximately equal in importance to Factor II, Section 508, which is slightly more important than Factor III – Past Performance.  All sub-factors under Factor I, Technical (Understanding of the Requirements, Key Personnel, Corporate Experience, Quality Control Plan and Transition Plan) are of equal importance.  The Contracting Officer shall also conduct a price analysis in accordance with the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b).  The non-price factors when combined are significantly more important than Factor IV, Price.  However, price may become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality.  Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered.  The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making award at the lowest overall price to the Government.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical features.  To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than “Acceptable” must be achieved for Factor I (and its associated sub – factors) and Factor II.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  



Pursuant to FAR 15.306(c) the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for reasons of efficiency.  Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1(f)(4), the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  To determine which firm represents the best value, the offers will be evaluated as outlined below.



FACTOR I.  TECHNICAL 



SUBFACTOR 1:  Understanding of the Requirements - The Government will evaluate the offeror’s understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW.  .  The offeror’s proposal shall demonstrate its comprehension of the specific objectives, intent, and requirements of the work; the soundness, practicality and feasibility of the proposed approach and work plans.  The Offeror shall submit a proposal which identifies potential risks and how they are mitigated and how the proposed solution(s) is capable of handling changes based on user requirements.  The proposal shall articulate how the proposed solution will integrate with CRM products (for example Salesforce).  The Government will also evaluate how the proposed solution (BPM tool and hosting provider) meets the FedRamp standard and all DOL and FISMA security requirements.



SUBFACTOR 2:  Key Personnel – The Government will evaluate the experience, qualifications and staff certifications of all contractor personnel. The offeror’s proposal shall include resumes for key personnel and also provide a matrix to include the background/experience of the company’s proposed key and non-key personnel mapped to the appropriate SOW tasking that supports the proposed labor category and level.  



SUBFACTOR 3:  Corporate Experience - The Government will evaluate work experience (within the last 3 years) submitted by the offeror of a similar nature, scope, complexity, and difficulty to that which will be performed under the prospective contract contemplated by this solicitation.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s work experience in developing cloud hosted BPM solutions within federal government agencies or private industries with 200+ users and the offeror’s history of improving business processes with the use of BPM technology by providing process efficiencies greater than 25%.  The Government will also evaluate:

the offeror’s knowledge of the amount of time necessary to develop a solution and its process for creating process flow efficiencies to create improvements for customers

the offerorr’s experience(s) delivering a solution with CRM interfaces

the offeror’s experience demonstrating the provisions in place to manage the separation of duties required to perform quality assurance testing of the designed solution to ensure all requirements are met and limit risk



SUBFACTOR 4:  Quality Control Plan – The Government will evaluate the Quality Control Plan (QCP) that details how they intend to monitor, inspect, and correct deficiencies for the requirements of the SOW.  The Government reserves the right to incorporate the QCP in the contract that will result from this solicitation.  If the QCP is incorporated into the resulting contract, the QCP will no longer be considered proprietary and will be considered releasable under FOIA. 



SUBFACTOR 5:  Transition Plan - The Government will evaluate the Phase-In Plan which contains a reasonable, realistic approach for assuming full contractual responsibility without disruption or degradation of performance during the start-up period.  The plan shall identify risk, propose appropriate mitigation strategies, proposes a realistic, achievable and affordable start-up schedule and staffing plan.  The plan shall ensure sufficient resources are on hand and available to begin work under this requirement.  It shall include a statement that the personnel proposed are available, trained, and qualified to perform the work under this effort.  In addition, the government will evaluate the Phase-Out Plan submitted by the offeror based on how it demonstrates the offeror’s ability to enable a smooth transition to replacement services 60 days prior to the end of the period of performance.



FACTOR II – SECTION 508  Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508.  Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT, VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.



FACTOR III – PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION  The Government will evaluate past performance of three (3) current or previous contracts for recent relevancy.  Relevancy is based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similarity, complexity, contract type and dollar value.  Offerors are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance data bases and sources other than those identified by the offeror and the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision.  The absence of past performance data will be rated “Unknown Confidence”, meaning the rating is treated neither favorable nor unfavorably.  Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sectors.  For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.  The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire, Attachment 1. Offeror's shall distribute the questionnaire included in the solicitation as an attachment to their references so the form can be completed and submitted to the Government.



Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions to permit a meaningful assessment of past performance. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.



Recency: For all contract references submitted, the contract is currently active or was completed within the last three years from the issuance date of the solicitation.  



Relevancy:  Performance being considered must have a logical connection to the work described in the solicitation.  In determining relevance, consideration will be given to such aspects as the service similarity, service complexity, contract type, and dollar value.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor.  



In evaluating performance information, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation. Furthermore, consideration will be given to the following regarding each offeror's overall performance record:



The offeror’s record of conformance to contract specifications and standards of good workmanship.



The offeror’s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance.



The offeror’s history for reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, timely award and management of contract costs, subcontracts, and whether the offeror met any applicable subcontracting goals



FACTOR IV – PRICE  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced.  Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b)(2).  Price may become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality.  No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.



Adjectival Ratings.  Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.  No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.

Factor I, Technical, will be rated using the following Adjectival Ratings: 



Factor II, Section 508, will be rated using the following Adjectival Ratings:



Factor III, Past Performance, will be evaluated using the following Adjectival Ratings:

1.  Relevance Determination:  

The following ratings will be used in making the relevance determination:







2.  Performance Confidence Ratings

Each proposal will be assessed a rating at an overall factor level after evaluating offerors' performance records.  Each offeror will be assessed one of the following ratings. This process is subjective in nature and will be based on the performance information collected.  



(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).



(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(4) ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

 

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

 

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

 

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

 

(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

 

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

 

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

 

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

 

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

Security



The Cloud Services solution  must  meet Federal government regulatory compliance requirements (i.e. Privacy Act, FISMA, CIPSEA, Federal Records Act, Freedom of Information Act, Trade Secrets Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Privacy Rules, etc.)

Security



Systems hosted by a third party Contractor must meet the same security requirements as a DOL hosted system As there are dependencies between the system and the hosting facility and supporting network it is common practice that the Contractor's supporting facilities (building, network, etc.) have an authority to operate in place as well as maintain and report on the security posture as defined by Federal Requirements (as indicated above). It is expected that the authority to operate for the supporting infrastructure already have a Federal sponsor.

Security



In the event a system compromise is detected and/or suspected, the Contractor shall assist DOL Incident Response Team in providing services and support to determine the system's security posture and potential/real time risk impact to the data, system, and program. This may require assistance from the third party Contractor's resources to include staff, access to hosting facilities, IT systems, reports, interviews, and documentation. This is applicable for both DOL and Contractor hosted options.

Security



In the event the system is identified for a DOL OIG audit the Contractor shall assist DOL

in providing audit services and support upon request during the DOL Inspector General

(IG) or other federally supported IG audit processes (i.e.; providing supporting evidence, ad-hoc reports, interviews, documentation, etc.). This is applicable for both DOL and Contractor hosted options.

Security



The provider shall meet at least four of the five Essential Characteristics of the Cloud Definition as set forth in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication 800-145 "The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing."

Security



The OAM system shall plan to comply with and integrate the Enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM). The DOL is establishing an IAM solution that shall provide the central service for identification and authentication decisions for all DOL applications. DOL IAM solution shall specifically provide a common authoritative identity and security entitlement management service across DOL employees/contractors, customer, and business partner communities of interest (COI). Two COI's have been identified - the internal COI (ICOI) and the external COI (ECOI).

Security



The Contractor shall provide ICOI: For ICOI, the IAM solution will fully support DOL HSPD-12 program goals, by providing common service capabilities that will enhance identification and security management, for the authorized users of its IT systems and physical facilities. Security entitlement services will be realized through services from the standards based PIV Credential.  Optionally, DOL will also support PKI certificates that may not be resident on PIV Credentials (i.e., software, profile-based PKI).

Security



The Contractor shall provide ECOI: For ECOI, the IAM solution will require at least the security services of IA. IA services will be supported through federated identity management services (e.g., SAML), and through preferred approaches for authorization security services that are more integrated to the IAM Services. Identification, Authentication, and Authorization (IAA) security services shall be supported through the use of standards-based protocols and approaches (XACML, OASIS WS.-- i.e., WS-Federation, WS-Trust. WS-Provisioning and WS Security).

Security



The Contractor shall provide Integration to these Enterprise IAM services as a mandatory requirement for all DOL applications. Application shall leverage the services of this enterprise solution as part of their identity and security management functions. DOL is achieving the highest possible security posture to protect government environments and data, and as such the highest security option will be the preferred option.



Two sets of security requirements have been identified: The Basic requirements and the

Security Assurance requirements.

Security



The Contractor shall ensure that IAM Basic Requirements are met: The application or service provider must support the following requirements:

Transport Security Services: Shall support appropriate transport security services by demonstrating capability for mutually authenticated SSLv3.0 or TLSv 1.0 authentication approaches when exchanging data over networks.

Contractor

Work Breakdown Structure

WBS is a hierarchical and incremental decomposition of the project into phases, deliverables and work packages. It is a tree structure, which shows a subdivision of effort required to achieve an objective; for example a program, project, and contract.



It is important to note that once an investment WBS has become baselined, the WBS elements and numbering cannot be changed without re-baselining the investment.  As a result, PMs should plan and define as much of the investment WBS up front before it is baselined

Ongoing/TBD

Shall be reflected in Weekly reports due COB Friday

Contractor

Master Schedule

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a Master Schedule that details all the tasks, resources, dependencies, lead times, projected timeline, milestones and deliverables as it relates to the overall effort and is aligned with industry management best practices.
