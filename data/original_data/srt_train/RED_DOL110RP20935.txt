    f. All Contractor employees receive on-going technical training as described in the Offeror’s proposal.

H.22   ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS (OCI)

       Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI):  The policy of DOL is to avoid contracting with Contractors who have unacceptable
       organizational conflicts of interest.  An organizational conflict of interest means that because of existing or planned activities, an
       offeror or Contractor is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial assistance to the agency, or has an unfair competitive
       advantage, or the offeror or Contractor’s objectivity is, or might be, impaired.  If the offeror does not have any OCI issues, it must
       positively affirm so in writing.

       The following provides potential vendors with examples of situations where mitigation plans may or may not be required by DOL.  These
       examples are not intended to be inclusive.

       Unequal access to information.  Access to “nonpublic information” as part of the performance of a DOL contract could provide the
       Contractor a competitive advantage in a later competition for any other DOL contract.  Such an advantage could easily be perceived as
       unfair by a competing vendor who is not given similar access to the relevant information.  If the requirements of DOL procurement
       anticipate the successful Contractor may have access to nonpublic information, the successful Contractor should be required to submit and
       negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.  Alternatively, the “nonpublic information” may be provided to all Contractors.


       Biased ground rules.  A Contractor in the course of performance of a DOL contract, has in some fashion established important “ground
       rule” for another DOL contract, where the same Contractor may be a competitor.  For example, a Contractor may have drafted the SOW,
       specifications, or evaluation criteria of a future DOL procurement.  The primary concern of DOL in this case is that a Contractor so
       situated could slant key aspects of procurement in its own favor, to the unfair disadvantage of competing Contractors.  If the
       requirements of DOL procurement anticipate the Contractor may have been in a position to establish important ground rules, including but
       not limited to those described herein, the Contractor should be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.


       Impaired objectivity.  A Contractor in the course of performance of a DOL contract is placed in a situation of providing assessment and
       evaluation findings over itself, or another business division, or subsidiary of the same corporation, or other entity with which it has a
       significant financial relationship.  The concern in this case is that the Contractor’s ability to render impartial advice to DOL could
       appear to be undermined by the Contractor’s financial or other business relationship to the entity whose work product is being assessed
       or evaluated.  In these situations, a “walling off” of lines of communication may well be insufficient to remove the perception that the
       objectivity of the Contractor has been tainted.  If the requirements of the DOL procurement indicate that the successful Contractor may
       be in a position to provide evaluations and assessments of itself or corporate siblings, or other entity with which it has a significant
       financial relationship, the affected Contractor should provide a mitigation plan that includes recusal by the Contractor from the
       affected contract work.  Such recusal might include divestiture of the work to a third party vendor.

       Disclosure by offerors or Contractors participating in a DOL acquisition.  Offerors or Contractors should provide information which
       concisely describes all relevant facts concerning any past, present or currently planned interest, (financial, contractual,
       organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed and bearing on whether the offeror or Contractor has a possible OCI.


       If the offeror or Contractor does not disclose any relevant facts concerning an OCI, the offeror or Contractor, by submitting an offer or
       signing the contract, warrants that to its best knowledge and belief, no such facts exist relevant to possible OCI.


       It is not the intention of DOL to exclude a Contractor from a competitive acquisition due to a perceived OCI.  DOL Contracting Officers
       are fully empowered to evaluate each potential OCI scenario based upon the applicable facts and circumstances.  The final determination
       of such action may be negotiated between the impaired Contractor and the DOL Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer’s business
       judgment and sound discretion in identifying, negotiating, and eliminating OCI scenarios should not adversely affect DOL’s policy for
       competition.  DOL is committed to working with potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and perceived OCI situations, without
       detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the mission of DOL, or the legitimate business interests of the vendor community.


       Mitigation plans:  The successful Contractor will be required to permit a Government audit of internal OCI mitigation procedures for
       verification purposes.  DOL reserves the right to reject a mitigation plan, if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, such a plan is
       not in the best interest of DOL.  After award, DOL will review and audit OCI mitigation plans as needed (in the event of any changes due
       to mergers, consolidations, or any unanticipated circumstances that may create an unacceptable organizational conflict of interest).

 I.4  52.217-8  OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES  (NOV 1999)


   The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.  These rates

 I.5  52.217-9  OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)


   (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 10..DAYS; provided that the Government

I.6  52.222-42  STATEMENT OF EQUIVALENT RATES FOR FEDERAL HIRES  (MAY 1989)


   In compliance with the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, and the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4), this clause
identifies the classes of service employees expected to be employed under the contract and states the wages and fringe benefits payable to each
if they were employed by the contracting agency subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5341 or 5332.


      This Statement is for Information Only:
      It is not a Wage Determination

   Employee Class                   Monetary Wage-Fringe Benefits

Computer Applications operator          $27.63 (see note 1)



 I.7  52.222-43  FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT AND SERVICE CONTRACT ACT - PRICE ADJUSTMENT (MULTIPLE YEAR AND OPTION CONTRACTS)  (NOV 2006)


   (a)  This clause applies to both contracts subject to area prevailing wage determinations and contracts subject to collective bargaining
agreements.

   (b)  The Contractor warrants that the prices in this contract do not include any allowance for any contingency to cover increased costs for
which adjustment is provided under this clause.

   (c)  The wage determination, issued under the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.), by the Administrator, Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, current on the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or
the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract.  If no such determination has been made applicable to this contract,
then the Federal minimum wage as established by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, (29 U.S.C. 206) current on
the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract.

   (d)  The contract price or contract unit price labor rates will be adjusted to reflect the Contractor's actual increase or decrease in
applicable wages and fringe benefits to the extent that the increase is made to comply with or the decrease is voluntarily made by the
Contractor as a result of:

     (1)  The Department of Labor wage determination applicable on the anniversary date of the multiple year contract, or at the beginning of
the renewal option period.  For example, the prior year wage determination required a minimum wage rate of $4.00 per hour. The Contractor chose
to pay $4.10.  The new wage determination increases the minimum rate to $4.50 per hour.  Even if the Contractor voluntarily increases the rate
to $4.75 per hour, the allowable price adjustment is $.40 per hour;

     (2)  An increased or decreased wage determination otherwise applied to the contract by operation of law; or

     (3)  An amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that is enacted after award of this contract, affects the minimum wage, and
becomes applicable to this contract under law.

   (e)  Any adjustment will be limited to increases or decreases in wages and fringe benefits as described in paragraph (d) of this clause, and
the accompanying increases or decreases in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but shall not otherwise
include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.

   (f)  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any increase claimed under this clause within 30 days after receiving a new wage
determination unless this notification period is extended in writing by the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor shall promptly notify the
Contracting Officer of any decrease under this clause, but nothing in the clause shall preclude the Government from asserting a claim within the
period permitted by law.  The notice shall contain a statement of the amount claimed and any relevant supporting data, including payroll
records, that the Contracting Officer may reasonably require.  Upon agreement of the parties, the contract price or contract unit price labor
rates shall be modified in writing.  The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment and
its effective date.

   (g)  The Contracting Officer or an authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books,
documents, papers and records of the Contractor until the expiration of 3 years after final payment under the contract.



 I.8  52.232-7  PAYMENTS UNDER TIME-AND-MATERIALS AND LABOR-HOUR CONTRACTS  (FEB 2007)


     The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer or the authorized
representative:

   (a) Hourly rate.

     (1) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor
category specified in the contract that are--

       (i) Performed by the Contractor;

       (ii) Performed by the subcontractors; or

       (iii) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control.

     (2) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of direct labor
hours performed.

     (3) The hourly rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.
Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is
performed by employees that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.

     (4) The hourly rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall
be payable on a prorated basis.

     (5) Vouchers may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer), to the Contracting
Officer or authorized representative. The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly
rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment and by--

       (i) Individual daily job timekeeping records;

       (ii) Records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; or

       (iii) Other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer.

     (6) Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government shall, except as otherwise provided in this contract, and subject
to the terms of paragraph (e) of this clause, pay the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative.

     (7) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a contract modification requiring the
Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to
protect the Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the amounts due under paragraph (a) of this
clause, but the total amount withheld for the contract shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor
executes and delivers the release required by paragraph (g) of this clause.

     (8) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having
performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the
Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the
Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to
the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.

   (b) Materials.

     (1) For the purposes of this clause--

       (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection
with the furnishing of the end product or service.

       (ii) Materials means--

         (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common
control;

         (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract;

         (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer
usage charges, etc.); and

         (D) Applicable indirect costs.

     (2) If the Contractor furnishes its own materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such
materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--

       (i) Quantities being acquired; and

       (ii) Actual cost of any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.

     (3) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for allowable cost of materials
provided the Contractor--

       (i) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or

       (ii) Ordinarily makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such
payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

     (4) Payment for materials is subject to the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract. The Contracting Officer will determine
allowable costs of materials in accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this contract.

     (5) The Contractor may include allocable indirect costs and other direct costs to the extent they are--

       (i) Comprised only of costs that are clearly excluded from the hourly rate;

       (ii) Allocated in accordance with the Contractor's written or established accounting practices; and

       (iii) Indirect costs are not applied to subcontracts that are paid at the hourly rates.

     (6) To the extent able, the Contractor shall--

       (i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and

       (ii) Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take
advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the reasons. The Contractor shall give credit
to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the
Contractor, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not deduct from gross costs the
benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the Government.

     (7) Except as provided for in 31.205-26(e) and (f), the Government will not pay profit or fee to the prime Contractor on materials.

   (c) If the Contractor enters into any subcontract that requires consent under the clause at 52.244-2, Subcontracts, without obtaining such
consent, the Government is not required to reimburse the Contractor for any costs incurred under the subcontract prior to the date the
Contractor obtains the required consent. Any reimbursement of subcontract costs incurred prior to the date the consent was obtained shall be at
the sole discretion of the Government.

   (d) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price
set forth in the Schedule, and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations
under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material
costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued,
will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of
the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this
contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater
or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price
for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Government has
reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price,
the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the
contract.

   (e) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and
the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and
until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised
ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in
the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the
increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling
price.

   (f) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit of the vouchers and supporting
documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the
Contracting Officer or authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to
increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the Contractor as the "completion voucher" and supporting
documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents
and the terms of paragraph (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion voucher, and
supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract,
but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.

   (g) Assignment and Release of Claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at
the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under
this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims
arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions:

     (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor.

     (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of
performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives
notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor
that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.

     (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against
patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.

   (h) Interim payments on contracts for other than services.

     (1) Interim payments made prior to the final payment under the contract are contract financing payments. Contract financing payments are
not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.

     (2) The designated payment office will make interim payments for contract financing on the 30TH day after the designated billing office
receives a proper payment request. In the event that the Government requires an audit or other review of a specific payment request to ensure
compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the specified due
date.

   (i) Interim payments on contracts for services. For interim payments made prior to the final payment under this contract, the Government will
make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.


 I.9  52.232-19  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984)


   Funds are not presently available for this contract.  The Government’s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of
appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may
arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability,
to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.


 I.10  52.245-2   GOVERNMENT PROPERTY INSTALLATION OPERATION SERVICES (JUNE 2007)


   (a) This Government Property listed in paragraph (e) of this clause is furnished to the Contractor in an "as-is, where is" condition. The
Government makes no warranty regarding the suitability for use of the Government property specified in this contract. The Contractor shall be
afforded the opportunity to inspect the Government property as specified in the solicitation.

   (b) The Government bears no responsibility for repair or replacement of any lost, damaged or destroyed Government property. If any or all of
the Government property is lost, damaged or destroyed or becomes no longer usable, the Contractor shall be responsible for replacement of the
property at Contractor expense. The Contractor shall have title to all replacement property and shall continue to be responsible for contract
performance.

   (c) Unless the Contracting Officer determines otherwise, the Government abandons all rights and title to unserviceable and scrap property
resulting from contract performance. Upon notification to the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall remove such property from the Government
premises and dispose of it at Contractor expense.

   (d) Except as provided in this clause, Government property furnished under this contract shall be governed by the Government Property clause
of this contract.

   (e) Government property provided under this clause:

      A) For all work performed on the Government’s premises, the Government will provide the Contractor with the following items for its use in
         the accomplishment of assigned tasks:
              1. Office space and associated office equipment, comparable to that provided to Government staff, to include, desks, chairs,
                 telephones (including authority to use the long distance system for work related communications), and miscellaneous office
                 supplies;
              2. Required ADP equipment and access to Government ADP systems and data bases required to accomplish tasks; and
              3. Miscellaneous minor office services to include telephone answering and message taking.




 I.11  52.249-14  EXCUSABLE DELAYS  (APR 1984)


   (a) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the Contractor shall not be in default because of any failure to perform this contract
under its terms if the failure arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of these
causes are (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4)
floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In each instance, the
failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. "Default" includes failure to make progress
in the work so as to endanger performance.

   (b) If the failure to perform is caused by the failure of a subcontractor at any tier to perform or make progress, and if the cause of the
failure was beyond the control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either, the Contractor shall not
be deemed to be in default, unless--

     (1) The subcontracted supplies or services were obtainable from other sources;

     (2) The Contracting Officer ordered the Contractor in writing to purchase these supplies or services from the other source; and

Past performance information concerning subcontractors and teaming partners cannot be disclosed to a private party without the subcontractor's
or teaming partner's consent.  Because a prime contractor is a private party, the Government will need that consent before disclosing
subcontractor past performance information to the prime during exchanges.  In an effort to assist the Government's Performance Confidence
Assessment Group (PCAG) in assessing your past performance relevancy and confidence, we request that the following consent form be completed by
the major subcontractors identified in your proposal.  The completed consent forms should be submitted as part of your Past Performance Volume.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M.1 NOTICE LISTING SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

       The following solicitation provisions pertinent to this section are hereby incorporated by reference (by Citation Number, Title, and
Date) in accordance with the FAR provision at FAR 52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE in Section L of this solicitation.
See FAR 52.252-1 for an internet address (if specified) for electronic access to the full text of a provision.


      NUMBER     TITLE DATE

      52.217-5   EVALUATION OF OPTIONS  JUL 1990



 M.2 METHOD OF AWARD


Basis for Award:  The Government will award a single Labor Hour, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract from this solicitation to the
responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government based on the best overall proposal that is
determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the three evaluation factors:  {Technical, Past
Performance, and Price}.  Factor I, Technical is significantly more important than Factor II, Past Performance. All sub-factors under Factor I,
Technical are of equal importance.

The evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  However, price will become
significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality.  Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the
lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest
overall price to the Government.  However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to
achieve slightly superior technical features. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than “Acceptable” must be achieved for
each evaluation factor or subfactor.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should
contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if
later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public
interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:  The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in  terms  of  program  commitments,
including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, such  that  the  proposal
is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.

Correction Potential of Proposals:  The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the “correction potential” of any deficiency or
uncertainty.  The judgment of such “correction potential” is within the sole discretion of the Government.  If an aspect of an Offeror’s
proposal not meeting the Government’s requirements is not considered correctable, the Offeror may be eliminated from further consideration for
award.

M.3      EVALUATION OF TECHNICAL PROPOSAL

(ii) Show relevant experience through personnel who are proposed to work on the contract that have had the required experience with another
company.

Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated
favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a neutral rating for the Past Performance factor.  For Offerors with
no relevant performance record, the Government may consider relevant performance information regarding key personnel.

The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorable nor unfavorable.  Contracts listed may include those entered into with
Government agencies or private sectors.  For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account
information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance, or subcontractors that will
perform key aspects of the requirement.

To demonstrate the Offerors previous experience, a response should be included for each of the below listed work areas that are required to be
performed in Section C, Scope of Work and Statement of Work of the Schedule.  These responses should: (1) identify individually, previous
contracts of the Offeror; (2) the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) of the contract and (3) demonstrate that the Offeror has
the qualifications necessary to effectively perform the proposed work.  Include different contracts for each work area if possible.  The areas
to address are as follows:

1)    Experience developing and supporting large-scale multi user, multi location tracking systems using a variety of architectures;

2)    Work developing and supporting large databases and/or data warehouses;

3)    Development/support of web (Internet) and client based user interfaces;

4)    Development and support of Windows and network Infrastructures in a complex, multi location organization, and;

5)    Experience administering litigation support programs.


6)    Contractor Performance Evaluation Survey.  For each individual past performance     synopsis provided in response to the above section,
the Government intends to    survey the Government contacts listed, and have those persons, or their designated  representatives, complete
Section J Attachment A the Past Performance Information  Sheet (PPIS).  These completed surveys will become part of the documentation set
evaluated by the Government as part of the technical evaluation of Offerors under    this solicitation.

7)    Past Performance Questionnaire Section J Attachment B.  The offeror shall complete  Part I of the Past Performance Questionnaire and e-
mail the questionnaire to the     Government and private sector technical representative responsible for the     past/current contract.  The
POC's shall be instructed to electronically complete     Part II of the questionnaire and e-mail the entire questionnaire to
Thompson.Sheila@dol.gov no later than January 4, 2010 at 11:00am EST.  The offeror   shall also e-mail to the Contract Specialist a list of all
the POC’s who were sent      a questionnaire.  The Government must receive this list no later than January 4,    2010 at 11:00 am EST.  The POC
List shall be submitted in Word for Windows Table  Format to include the following fields: Solicitation Number; Company Name; Contract
Number; Government Agency; POC Last Name, First Name; POC Title; POC Telephone       Number; POC E-Mail Address; Date E-Mailed to POC

M.5   EVALUATION OF PRICE PROPOSALS

FACTOR III:  – PRICE: The Government will evaluate price for this procurement will be pursuant to determining best value.  However, as the other
assessments of the Offerors become more equal cost may become a determining factor in award selection.

The Offeror’s submission for Volume 3, Price, will be evaluated as follows:

The Government will review the Pricing submissions for completeness and accuracy.

A price reasonableness review will be conducted for all Offerors.  For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government
that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market.  Normally, price reasonableness is established through
adequate price competition, but may also be determined through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is
not unbalanced.  Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2).

Non-Price Factors:  The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor
listed first:

Factor I, Technical is significantly more important than Factor II, Past Performance, which when combined, are significantly more important than
Factor III “Price”.  However, as offerors ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor III “Price” becomes significantly more
important in the award decision.

 (a) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.
