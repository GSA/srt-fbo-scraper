SECTION H – SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS





H.1		Communication



Any HRSA communication products developed under this contract will require an additional separate clearance on an HHS-615 (for text and/or graphic publications and products that will be printed, posted on the Web, or disseminated through other electronic methods, such as by email) or an HHS-524A (for audiovisual products, including those that will be posted on the Web). Communication clearance for this contract itself does not satisfy the requirement to seek clearance of the specific HRSA communication products.



H.2		Printing and Duplicating



The printing of government documents must be accomplished through the Government Printing Office (GPO). Contractors and grantees shall not be used as sources of printing for the Department or OPDIVS. Therefore, the inclusion of printing in contracts and grants is prohibited unless authorized by the Joint Committee on Printing (JCP). All requests for waivers must go through the HHS Department Printing Officer. Contractors may prepare copy, illustrative material (forms etc.) and /or camera ready copy for the purpose of producing publications.



The Contractor shall not engage in, nor subcontract for, any printing (as the term is defined in Title 1 of the Government Printing and Binding Regulations in effect on the effective date of this contract) in connection with the performance of work under this contract; except that performance of a requirement under this contract involving less than 25,000 production units in the aggregate of multiple pages will not be deemed to be printing. A production unit is defined as one sheet, size 8.5 x 11 inches, one side only, and one color.



Regarding the use of private funds for printing, the regulations state that when appropriated funds are to be used to create information for publication, the printing of that information cannot be made available to a private publisher for publication without prior approval of the congressional Joint Committee on Printing by way of the office of HHS Department Printing Officer. For any questions, please contact the HHS Department Printing Officer at 301-594-3185.



H.3		Clearance/Production of Information Products/Services 



The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, requires clearance for any external communication products, which includes publications, audiovisual products, multimedia products, exhibits (including exhibit structures),  conferences (including program/agenda books and other meeting materials), or public affairs services produced for or by HRSA through this contract as a deliverable. An external communication product is one that will be distributed outside of HRSA in any quantity.  This clearance, which takes approximately 4 weeks, is obtained by the project officer through HRSA’s Office of Communications.



It is the policy of HHS that HHS must be prominently and dominantly identified as the primary publisher/producer, to include the name of HHS and placement of the HHS logo, on all communication materials, including those produced for Government publications and Government printed matter by contractors.



The name of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Health Resources and Services Administration must be spelled out on the front cover of publications and on the opening and closing frames of audiovisual products.  The HHS and HRSA logos must be displayed in addition to spelling out the names of the Department and the Agency.  Use of the HHS and HRSA logos that include the names of the Department and the Agency as part of the graphics in the logos does not satisfy the requirement to spell out the names of HHS and HRSA.  All publications and audiovisual products must display the month and year of issuance.  The HHS and HRSA logos must be displayed on the front cover of any publications and on the opening and closing frames of any audiovisual products.  The requirement for placement of the logos may be satisfied by displaying the HHS logo on the bottom left corner and the HRSA logo on the bottom right corner.  The HHS logo should be larger than the HRSA logo. Government publications or other Government printed matter may not include the contractor’s logo unless specifically authorized in accordance with agency policy and procedures ()

reports, booklets, manuals, fact sheets, newsletters, brochures, flyers

Internet publications

press releases, advisories, other media materials (including press kits)

exhibits, exhibit structures 

conferences, meeting materials (including program/agenda books)

summaries, monographs, proceedings

slides, overhead transparencies, posters

audio and videotapes, films, CDs, DVDs, and other audiovisual products

multimedia products, educational or information modules

advertisements and/or scripts for radio, TV, Web, or other venue



Internal publications (no copies will be distributed outside of the Agency in print; electronically by any means, including by email or listserv; and will not be posted on the Internet) are exempted from this requirement.  Where appropriate, the words Health Resources and Services Administration, Bureau …, Office of, Division of …, shall be included above the HRSA logo.  



Title 44 of the U.S. Code requires that the printing of any publication developed under this contract shall be done by the Government Printing Office. Printing shall be coordinated through the Contracting Officer Technical Representative.  



NOTE: OMB clearance must be obtained if you (the contractor) intend to survey or interview more than 9 people outside of HRSA and/or the Department, including grantees.  Failure on the part of the Contractor to comply with the printing and duplicating, and publication clearance requirements stated above will be deemed unauthorized services and reimbursement will be denied.

H.6		Limited Use of Data

The Contractor shall not use, disclose, or reproduce proprietary data that bears a restrictive legend, other than as required in the performance of this effort.  Nothing herein shall preclude the use of any data independently acquired by the Contractor without such limitations or prohibit an agreement at no cost to the Government between the Contractor and the data owner which provides for greater rights to the Contractor.

When reviewed at the HRSA’s site, the working papers will be sent to the HRSA office for review and evaluation by HRSA staff.  After completion of the review, HRSA may hold a conference with the contractor to discuss any issues. HRSA may choose to visit the contractor or subcontractor site during the audit to assess performance of the review. The contractor shall maintain an internal quality control program adequate to ensure that the requirements of the contract are met. As with the working paper review, HRSA reserves the right to obtain and review all working papers associated with the contractor’s internal quality control program. These reviews shall be conducted at HRSA’s site, the working papers will be sent to the HRSA office for review and evaluation by HRSA staff. After completion of the review, HRSA may hold a conference with the contractor to discuss any issues. HRSA may choose to visit the contractor and/or the subcontractor’s site during the review to assess performance of the reviews.



H.10		Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12



To perform the work specified herein the Contractor personnel may require access to sensitive data, regular access to HHS-controlled facilities and/or access to HHS information systems, the Government may require that this effort entail a background investigation.

Contractors should ensure that the employees whose names they submit have a reasonable chance for approval. While delays in performance caused by successful investigations will be the Government's responsibility, delays associated with rejections will be the Contractor's responsibility.  Typically, the Government conducts investigations and checks at no cost to the Contractor. Multiple investigations for the same position, whether- resulting from rejections or resulting from an employee's move to another position(s) or company, may at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reductions(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation.





H.11		Central Contractor Registration

the CCR database" means that (1) the Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record "Active".

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD



M.1.	General



The completed GPAT is a threshold requirement for technical review, and will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis. A proposal that does not include a completed GPAT, or includes a GPAT that is determined to be insufficient, will not pass, and will not be considered technically acceptable. PROPOSALS THAT FAIL THE GPAT REVIEW WILL NOT BE SUBMITTED FOR TECHNICAL REVIEW. 



	Prior to technical review, each proposal’s GPAT will be reviewed on a pass/fail basis to determine if it sufficiently addresses the Government’s needs as specified in the GPAT (see Attachment __). Any proposal which does not include a GPAT, or which contains a GPAT that is determined to be inadequate, cannot pass, and therefore will not be submitted for technical review.



In order for proposals to be considered acceptable and eligible for evaluation, they must be prepared in accordance with the instructions given in this RFP. Proposals which merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with the requirements of the Government’s statement of work will not be eligible for an award. 



	M2.	Negotiations



	Offerors are advised that the Government may elect to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with the Offeror(s). Therefore, the Offeror’s initial proposal should contain the Offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government also reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer determines them to be in the best interest of the Government.



	M.3.        	Selection of Offerors



The acceptability or unacceptability of the technical portion of each contract proposal will be based upon an evaluation by a technical review committee. The committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity to the evaluation criteria of the RFP (see Section L and M), utilizing point scores and written critiques. The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an Offeror.



The Government anticipates that one  awards will result from this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to make no award as a result of this RFP. In addition, the RFP may be amended if determined to be in the best interest of the Government.



	M.4.	Award Criteria



The Technical Proposal will receive paramount consideration in the selection of the contractor for this acquisition.  In the event that the technical evaluation reveals that two or more offers are approximately equal in technical ability, then the estimated cost of performance will become paramount; however, the government reserves the right to make an award based on the best value for the Government, cost and technical factors considered.



	




	M.5.	Evaluation Criteria



		M.5.1.	

	a.	The merits of the proposal will be evaluated carefully using the following criteria and points as they relate to the content of the corresponding paragraphs of the Technical Proposal Instructions.



b.	Note:  The following evaluation criteria (1-7), for a total of 100 points, will apply to your technical proposal which will be evaluated by a technical evaluation panel (TEP).  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. If such a circumstance exists, the maximum number of points the offeror may receive for its technical proposal is 95 and the technical proposal will be evaluated on a scale of 0 to 95. If such a circumstance exists, all technical proposal scores will be converted to a percentage of the total points possible according to the applicable rating scale. The TEP will recommend technical acceptability or unacceptability of the proposal.

			

		The technical proposal shall not exceed 150 single-spaced pages, including resumes and other required appendices. Offerors are advised to strictly observe limitations on the length and format specified since review of the proposal will be limited to 150 pages.

              6.   Past Performance 							   5 points

      The Offeror shall be responsible for requesting three (3) references to submit the          Contractor Performance Report (Attachment E) to the Contract Specialist no later than September 7, 2012, 10:00 am EST by fax at (301) 443-5462 or (301) 443-6038 (no exceptions). Do not submit more than three (3) references. The Government reserves the right to obtain past performance information from any source. 



The Offeror’s past performance will be evaluated in conjunction with the  technical  review.  The overall total score for the past performance rating for each Offeror will be determined by calculating the average of the surveys received. The overall total score will be rounded to the nearest whole number to assign an appropriate adjectival rating (0 = Unsatisfactory, 1 = Poor, 2 = Fair, 3 = Good, 4 = Excellent, 5 = Outstanding).



The elements being rated are as follows:



Quality of Product or Service  


Unsatisfactory- Non-conformances is jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards containing similar requirements.

 	

Poor - Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

 	

Fair - Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

 	

Good - There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.

 	

Excellent - There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate additional costs to the Government.

 	

Outstanding - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent". 

 	

Cost Control



Unsatisfactory - Ability to manage cost issues is jeopardizing performance of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, this level of ability to manage cost issues constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.



Poor - Ability to manage cost issues requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.



Fair - Ability to control cost issues requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.



Good - There are no, or very minimal, cost management issues and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.



Excellent - There are no cost management issues and the Contractor has exceeded the contract requirements, achieving cost savings to the Government.



Outstanding - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where the contractor achieved cost savings and performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".



iii. Timeliness of Performance

Unsatisfactory–Delays are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards.



Poor–Delays require significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.



Fair–Delays require minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.



Good–There are no, or minimal, delays that impact achievement of contract requirements.



Excellent–There are no delays and the contractor has exceeded the agreed upon time schedule.



Outstanding–The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".



                         iv. Business Relations


Unsatisfactory–Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is not effective. If not substantially mitigated or corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards.


Poor - Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is marginally effective.

 	

Fair–Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is somewhat effective.

 	

Good–Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is consistently effective.

 	

Excellent–Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues exceeds Government expectation.

 	

Outstanding–The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".

Note: In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available; the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. If such a circumstance exists, the maximum number of points the Offeror may receive for its technical proposal is 95 and the technical proposal will be evaluated on a scale of 0 to 95. If such a circumstance exists, all technical proposal scores will be converted to a percentage of the total points possible according to the applicable rating scale.

Statement of Work



1.  BACKGROUND



The primary goal of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2009 (Ryan White Program)”  as  administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), under Title XXVI of the PHS Act, is to improve the availability and quality of HIV/AIDS services for low income, uninsured and underinsured individuals and families. The Ryan White Program reaches over 500,000   individuals through more than 2,000 funded service providers each year, making it the Federal Government's largest program specifically for people living with HIV disease.  



Recipients of Ryan White Program funds are required to report to the Health Resources and Services Administration’s HIV/AIDS Bureau (HRSA/HAB) how those funds have been used to provide services to low-income and underserved individuals and families living with HIV/ AIDS. There are three primary annual reporting requirements: The annual Ryan White Services Report (RSR), the semi-annual AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) Drug Report (ADR) and the ADAP Quarterly Report (AQR).   For the RSR, data submitted to HRSA/HAB includes a grantee and provider level file that describes characteristics of the organization and, starting in 2009, a client-level file that provides information on client demographics, services received, and for those providing outpatient ambulatory medical care, a variety of clinical fields.    For the AQR, data submitted to HRSA/HAB includes aggregate information regarding the grantee, program characteristics and clients served.  The ADR, also a grantee and client-level file, goes into effect in 2013 and includes information on the type and quantity of HIV/AIDS medications dispensed through state ADAP programs.



CAREWare is a well-functioning, well-established, and widely used electronic client-level health information system developed by the Bureau that supports the above reporting and data collection needs of grantees and providers.   This contract shall support, at a minimum, essential data collection, reporting and quality management functions for Grantee and provider funded services. The contractor shall also ensure that the CAREWare application is well-supported through a helpdesk and technical support and stays current, to the degree outlined in this request, with the initiatives promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONCHIT) () and the President’s National HIV/AIDS Strategy.

1. Gross Summary–include only major categories of costs in the order illustrated.



2. Certifications and Signature are illustrated in Exhibit B. The Certification of Costs/Fee is mandatory; the Price Stabilization Certification is required only when called for in the Submission of Invoices and Place of Payment article of the contract. The next page in order should be the SF 1035.



Completions of Form 1034–On the “Detail” Form 1035, provide a breakdown to support the total amount cited in both Form 1034 and Summary of Expenditures. The purpose of the detailed information is to assist the HRSA Contracting officer and program personnel in relating costs incurred to work performed. The several categories of cost will be itemized and described as follows:



Direct labor costs consist of salaries and wages paid for work performed directly for the contract and pursuant to its terms. Such labor costs (excluding fringe benefits and overtime premium pay) will be billed as follows:



Provide the job title or classification of the worker and provide for each classification:  the number of hours worked, the hourly rate, and the total wage or salary. The name of the worker should be provided, but when a great number of routine workers are involved, the position classifications only will suffice.



   The cost of direct labor charged to the contract must be supported by time records maintained in the contractor’s office; if salaries are involved, reasonable estimates on a post basis may be used in lieu of time records.

  

Fringe benefits are to be treated according to the contractor's established practice:



If fringe benefits, bonuses, etc. are included in the overhead pool, no specific entry is required.



Fringe benefits can be treated as direct costs, in which case enters the fringe benefits expressed as a percentage factor of the direct labor base or show the Actual Fringe Benefits cost.



Materials and supplies should include only those items that the contractor normally treats as "direct costs". Bill these costs under major classifications or categories such as office supplies, chemicals, electronics parts, etc., unless any one particular item within a class exceeds $300.00, in which case all such item(s) exceeding $300.00 must be specifically identified. 

Note: Under no circumstances shall any item of non-expendable equipment be included within these classifications (see 8 below). 



Premium pay of any kind (including overtime) must be authorized by the Contracting Officer in advance. Billings for unauthorized premium pay cause frequent delays in payment due to suspensions and exchange of correspondence. Generally such pay is not included in the direct labor base and should not be included in the billing for "direct labor" unless the contractor has consistently followed this practice in the past as a matter of policy. Make entries as follows:

	

In Summary of Expenditures –List as a single item.



In SF 1035–itemize for each position or job category referencing the Contracting Officer's (CO) letter of authorization. Note on Special Authorizations: According to the contract, certain costs require specific authorization in writing by the CO.  Whenever, the voucher includes costs pursuant to CO authorization, include for example, the reference: "CO letter (date)" or "approval number 57/74/115" if the CO cites said number in his letter.



Travel, as authorized by the contract, shall include the following in the SF 1035.



Travel by contractor shall provide:

Name of traveler or title

Dates of departure and return to departure point

Transportation costs

If claim for subsistence is on per diem basis, show number of days, rate, and amount, as authorized in contract.  If claim is based on actual cost of subsistence, show on a daily basis the amounts claimed for lodging and meals separately.

       

References to Contracting Officer's letter of authorization if approval is necessary



Travel by consultants shall provide detail similar to contractor travel above.



Consultant fees must reflect each consultant's name, daily honorarium, and number of days claimed. Travel for consultants (if applicable) must be itemized separately.     

  

Subcontract requires the name of each subcontractor involved and the dollar amount claimed. Costs claimed by cost reimbursement subcontractors must be on an "as incurred" basis and subcontractor backup information similar to the SF 1035 must be obtained and attached for each subcontractor.       



Equipment is an article of personal property, complete in itself, that is of a durable nature with an expected service life of one year or more. Equipment does not ordinarily lose its identity or become a component part of another article when put to use. For the purposes of invoicing and reporting under HRSA contracts, the definition of non-expendable property and equipment are equivalent because the HRSA definition of non-expendable property does not include a dollar limitation. (The standard definition of "non-expendable property" considers items costing $200.00 or more–excluding transportation, installation, taxes–with a useful life of a year or more and property sensitive to conversation to private use (no cost limit).



Therefore, when billing for non-expendable property (equipment) costs, the Contractor must attach live (5) copies of a completed form, HEW 565 Report of Non-expendable Government Property in Possession of Contractor, to the original invoice copy. The Contractor will retain the sixth copy. Only that property being billed for during the applicable billing period shall be included in the HEW 565. In addition, one (1) copy of each vendor invoice covering purchased property shall be attached to the original invoice.



Overhead will be charged at provisional rates resulting from audit determination and\or negotiation. Provisional rates will apply pending the establishment of final negotiated overhead rates for the contractor's fiscal year.



Other direct costs are minor costs that cannot be placed within any of the categories listed above. Identify by categories to the extent both possible and reasonable.



Fixed fee, when applicable, should be billed by prorating the negotiated total fixed fee to costs incurred. Applying a fee percentage to the fee base will achieve this effect. Refer to the contract provisions for guidance.

GOVERNMENT PRODUCT ACCESSIBILITY TEMPLATE

For Data Services or Information Retrieval Systems,

Web-based and non-web based Information and Documentation



Summary

Column one involves consideration of all the Sections of the Standard that might apply to any deliverable.  The total number of provisions within each Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses.  

Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type.  Some of these may not be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor’s deliverable.  If the deliverable involves consideration of additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.

Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard.  Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the deliverable.

Column four is a summary of the vendor’s response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the Standard.

Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected applicable provisions and actual product features.








Subpart B -- Technical Standards 

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.  



Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.

Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to the expected deliverable?)

Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in providing accessibility information. 

Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.

Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as applicable.

There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.



Excellent

There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate additional costs to the Government.



Outstanding

The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".

Unsatisfactory

Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is not effective. If not substantially mitigated or corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards.



Poor

Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is marginally effective.



Fair

Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is somewhat effective.



Good

Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is consistently effective.



Excellent

Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues exceeds Government expectation.



Outstanding

The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".
