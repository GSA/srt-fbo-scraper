1. PURPOSE
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and applied document used to make sure that systematic quality
assurance methods are used in the administration of the standards included in this contract. The intent is to ensure that the Contractor
performs in accordance with performance metrics set forth in the contract documents, that the Government receives the quality of services called
for in the contract and that the Government only pays for the acceptable level of services received.

2. AUTHORITY
The implementation of this QASP is provided in the Defense Procurement Acquisition Policy Memorandum, dated 14 Jul 2008 for “Management of
contractor Performance under Time & Materials and Labor Hour Contracts for Services,” which provides for inspection and acceptance of the
services and documentation provided under this Call and to be accomplished by the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative.

3. SCOPE
The Contractor is to provide operation support entailing daily review/resolution of issues/problems associated with the DFAS Disbursing
Operations Document Processing System software and maintenance.  Attention to system processing is required to ensure problems are immediately
identified and resolved with operations returned to normal with minimum disruption. The QASP is put in place to provide Government surveillance
oversight of the Contractor’s quality control efforts to assure that they are timely and effective, and are delivering the results specified in
the call.  The QASP is not a part of the contract nor is it intended to duplicate the Contractor’s quality control efforts. The Government has
provided the Contractor an informational copy of the QASP as an Attachment to the request for quote to support the Contractor’s efforts and to
provide the contractor an opportunity to comment and propose innovative solutions for the Government’s QASP.

4.  ASSUMPTIONS
The assumptions are to capture the quality of service provided to customers. Therefore, the three elements that will be focused on for the
purpose of this QASP are as follows:  equipment availability and timely response to issues requiring software assistance.

 Instructions

The “offeror” (identified in Section I, Block A) is submitting a response to a request for proposal issued by the Defense Finance and Accounting
Service (DFAS) for Document Processing Systems Software and Maintenance to be performed in Indianapolis, IN and Columbus, OH.

Your candid responses to this questionnaire will assist DFAS in evaluating the offeror’s past performance (i.e. How was the quality of the
services this offeror provided in the past?).  By gathering this information (not only on this offeror, but on all the companies who submit a
quote to provide these required services) we strive to determine which company’s quote will be most advantageous to DFAS.

We appreciate the time and effort you take to verify the information provided by the offeror in Section I and more importantly to complete
Sections II and III regarding the services you received from them.

          (1)          These check printing systems are fully integrated and capable of printing and inserting checks, Advice of Payments (AOP)
             if required, and/or other documents such as flyers or special inserts on an ad hoc basis.  The systems print, match and insert
             appropriate AOPs or other documents with the correct checks into the correct envelopes.


          2) Each printing location provides check/AOP printing function.  DFAS-IN currently has small off-line check printers that require
             separate operating systems to print off-line checks containing appropriate MICR coding and check formatting.


          3) DFAS-IN and DFAS-CO each act as a COOP facility for each other in case printing operations are interrupted for an extended period
             of time at either site.  In order for DFAS to meet the COOP requirement, both sites are required to be maintained as mirror images
             of each other.


          4) Check and AOP files are received from the following various current systems:
      STANFINS Redesign One (SRD1)
      Central Disbursing System (CDS)
      Automated Disbursing System (ADS)
      Marine Corps Total Force System (MCTFS)
      Defense Joint Military System (DJMS)
                 Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS)
                 Enterprise Business System/Business System Modernization (EBS/BSM)
                 Deployable Disbursing System (DDS)


          5) The Vision2K proprietary software owned and maintained by Inspectron that operates the cameras integrated with the Eagle F80
             Printer listed in 1(c) above was provided as a bundled package with the cameras.


2) SCOPE: The Contractor shall provide check printing software and appropriate maintenance for the DFAS Check/AOP Printing operation.  The check
   printing software must have the ability to accurately accept check and/or AOP print files submitted in various formats from multiple
   entitlement systems (see 1 (c)(4) above) and create a standard check print format containing Treasury acceptable security features.  The
   software must sort the files in zip code sequence to enable the Government to take advantage of bulk mailing rates and discounts.  The
   software must create and print applicable MICR coding and two dimensional (2D) bar coding on Treasury check roll stock.  The check number must
   be printed on the check either sequentially or as identified on the incoming check print file.  The AOP must be printed with the two
   dimensional (2D) barcode and if appropriate, matched with the associated check.  AOPs may contain multiple pages.  COTS software is to be
   provided by the Contractor to sort and pre-process check and AOP print files and prepare them for the required check and AOP format in black
   and/or MICR ink.  The high-speed document inserters place the processed checks, AOPs, or other documents into envelopes alone or together as
   required.  The COTS software must be capable of managing the complete document printing process and associated equipment with the exception of
   machine specific control software.

   The software must be compatible and interface with all other components of the current print system equipment/hardware listed in section 1 of
   the PWS. The software must be updated as necessary to accommodate any system changes that impact the print files received or changes mandated
   by Treasury or the United States Postal Service (USPS).

   All PCs listed in section 1 of the PWS that are loaded with the Check Printing Software located in the printing facilities must be kept
   updated by the contractor with current operating system, antivirus, and security upgrades in accordance with DoD standards.

   All software will be evaluated at least annually by representatives of the Contractor and DFAS for opportunities for enhancement of the
   functionality and ease of use.  This evaluation must occur prior to the expiration of the current contract or the exercise of the option year.


3.    REQUIREMENTS: The contractor shall provide a software solution to the check printing mission utilizing all equipment currently used for
   printing and mailing checks and documents in the support of the disbursing mission.  The software must be able to accept incoming check print
   files in various formats, print checks, AOPs, and other miscellaneous documents as may be necessary and ensure matching documents (as
   applicable) are stuffed into the appropriate envelopes.


   a)  Software. The contractor may be required to develop enhancements or modification to the products identified in section 1(c) above.  Due to
   the COOP requirement that all DFAS check print locations have the same software, software enhancements or improvements shall be provided to
   and operate at all DFAS locations that have check and/or AOP printing capabilities.

      The Contractor shall implement a software test run file to validate all software changes prior to use in production.


               i. The Contractor shall provide check printing software and appropriate maintenance for the DFAS Check/AOP Printing operation.
                  The check printing software must have the ability to accurately accept check and/or AOP print files submitted in various
                  formats from multiple entitlement systems (see 1 (c)(4) above) and create a standard check print format containing Treasury
                  acceptable security features including the amount written numerically and in words.
              ii. The software must sort the files in zip code sequence to enable the Government to take advantage of bulk mailing rates and
                  discounts.
             iii. The software must create and print applicable MICR coding and two dimensional (2D) bar coding on Treasury check roll stock.
                  The check number must be printed on the check either sequentially or as identified on the incoming check print file.
              iv. The AOP must be printed with the two dimensional (2D) barcode and if appropriate, matched with the associated check.  AOPs may
                  contain multiple pages.
               v. COTS software is to be provided by the Contractor to sort and pre-process check and AOP print files and prepare them for the
                  required check and AOP format in black and/or MICR ink.
              vi. The high-speed document inserters place the processed checks, AOPs, or other documents into envelopes alone or together as
                  required.
             vii. The COTS software must be capable of managing the complete document printing process and associated equipment with the
                  exception of machine specific control software.
            viii. The software must be compatible and interface with all other components of the current print system equipment/hardware listed
                  in section 1 of the PWS.
              ix. The software must be updated as necessary to accommodate any system changes that impact the print files received or changes
                  mandated by Treasury or the United States Postal Service (USPS).
               x. All PCs listed in section 1 of the PWS that are loaded with the Check Printing Software located in the printing facilities must
                  be kept updated by the contractor with current operating system, antivirus, and security upgrades in accordance with DoD
                  standards.
              xi. All software will be evaluated at least annually by representatives of the Contractor and DFAS for opportunities for
                  enhancement of the functionality and ease of use.  This evaluation must occur prior to the expiration of the current contract
                  or the exercise of the option year.




   b)  Maintenance. This software maintenance support pertains to the COTS products and any DFAS enhancements thereto.  As a minimum, the
   following shall be provided:

      i.    Customer support. Customer support shall include help desk, 24 hour a day problem reporting,   on-line analysis and software fixes.
           The contractor shall provide software engineers to service issues in a timely manner (same day) as needed.  Due to the security
           requirements involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the print files are not releasable outside the DFAS facilities.
           The Customer support shall be available during the Principal Period of Maintenance (PPM) see paragraph 3(c) of the PWS.
      ii.   New versions of contractor provided software or product enhancements shall be provided and installed   by the contractor or other
           qualified technical individuals authorized by the Disbursing Officer.  These modifications should include, but are not limited to new
           functions, reports, general software enhancement or modifications.
      iii.        Due to the COOP requirement that all DFAS locations have the same software, all software  changes    shall be provided to all
           DFAS locations at no additional costs.  That includes all updates, fixes, software enhancements, and modifications based on customer
           requests.
      iv.   Changes to the COTS software required by Postal or Federal law shall be provided to all DFAS locations at  no additional charge.
     v.       The Contractor shall create an image of the initial system disk to be used as a baseline for all        computers attached to the
        printing equipment.
      vi.          All PCs used within the DPS shall operate with the same base configuration image.
     vii.  The Contractor is to obtain from DFAS quarterly updates to the PC’s operating systems (OS) and  any      DFAS required security
           software. Once the OS and security software has been installed, the DFAS  Infrastructure Support Branch shall be requested to scan
           the system for vulnerabilities.  After the scan has been completed, the new system image shall be distributed to the other DFAS
           printing location and installed by the Contractor or other qualified technical individuals.  If qualified technical DFAS staff and if
           acceptable to both parties, DFAS technical staff may perform this function.
     viii. The Contractor shall be available to assist DFAS Network engineers in any attempts to further
           automate the print room operation. If the contractor requires system rights and permissions on the local personal computers to
           manipulate the current COTS software then they shall fill out the proper System Authorization Access Request (DD Form 2875), through
           DFAS.  The work under this order will consist of expert services in the analysis, development, coding and implementation of COTS
           software changes.  As Treasury, US Post Office or DFAS policies, procedures, and regulations change or new business areas are
           identified, the Contractor is required to provide necessary systems modifications to meet DFAS changing needs.
      ix.   All contractor services shall be in accordance with DFAS 8000.1R.  These publications will be available from the Contracting
           Officer’s Representative (COR).
      x.    The Contractor shall coordinate with the Contracting Officer to define contractual adjustments requiring the contractor to produce
           and maintain text file records for software change program logic.  Any such records will include plain text software program logic
           for analysis of additions, deletions, or other modifications between subsequent software program changes.  Error popups created by
           the systems during production will provide error reports in a manner that allows operators with no IT knowledge to understand the
           issue and how to report/adjust it.  The contractor shall afford the Government access to these records to the extent required to
           carry out a program necessary to safeguard against threats and hazards to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of Government
           data.
      xi.   Unless specifically authorized by DFAS Information and Technology, the print room computer network shall operate isolated from the
           DFAS Enterprise Local Area Network (ELAN) and all other network connections.  Data file transfer to the print room network shall
           occur using a physical air-gap.


   c)  Principal Period of Maintenance (PPM) Coverage.  PPM hours shall be 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday, and weekends during
   month-end processing. Legal holidays are excluded.


   d) Hours of Work At DFAS Locations: The Contractor shall schedule his work hours to coincide with the working hours of the government
      facility.  The Contractor shall not perform work at the facility during other hours without written approval from the Government COR.

   e) Reporting.  The Contractor shall provide a 24-hour a day/7 day a week answering service or web page for reporting operating problems.  The
      reporting procedure, including telephone numbers or web page address, shall be provided within ten calendar days after award of the
      contract.

   f) Response time and Service Call Escalation.

      All service calls shall be responded to same day and prior to 5:00 p.m. EST.  DFAS performs daily operations that can not wait to be solved
      next day; therefore service is needed same day until a solution is discovered.  Some instances will require work during non-DFAS core
      operation hours if solutions have not been found prior to 5:00 p.m. EST.  The following are to be preformed faster if service calls are
      made close to end of day (2:00 p.m. EST or later), in order to ensure DFAS Daily Operations still releases mail on time.  Based on DFAS
      operation hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST, the Contractor shall respond to Government problems as follows:




      i.    2 hour return call response.  Within 2 hours of receiving a problem call, a contractor representative will place a return call to the
           government POC leaving the service request message.  This can also be done by email or online.
      ii.   4 hour problem investigation response. Within 4 hours of that returned call, a contractor technician will place a call to the
           appropriate DFAS POC to begin investigating the reported system fault.  At this time, DFAS may request onsite assistance by the
           Contractor.  This may require a scheduling agreement between DFAS and the contractor at the time of the call.
      iii.  6 hour problem evaluation response. Within 6 hours of the end of the 4 hour problem investigation response, DFAS POC will receive a
           call or email from the contractor technician with an evaluation and status of the reported problem.
      iv.   8 hours problem isolation. Within 8 hours the problem should be isolated.  If the problem has not been isolated, the Contractor shall
           make arrangements to have a software technical expert onsite. In the case where it is determined that the data file is at fault, the
           remedy is that DFAS must obtain a reissuance of that data file.  If the problem is determined to be a program fault, a fix will be
           initiated and installed on the system within 24 hours of fault isolation.  The fix will be installed by the Contractor or their
           authorized designee. The authorized designee must comply with all security requirements and clearances the Contractor is required to
           adhere to.
      v.    24 hour problem solution. If the program problem has not been remedied within 24 hours, an additional contractor technician will be
           sent to the site and remain (during normal working hours), until the program problem is solved.


   g) Credits - Failure To Meet Required Performance Level

           i) System availability will be determined monthly.  System credits will be taken as a discount from the monthly amount due the
              contractor. The provisions of this paragraph shall in no way diminish the Government's rights under the Termination For Default
              provisions of the contract.  The System Availability Rate shall be computed by subtracting the system down time as a result of
              system issues from the total standard monthly system availability and dividing the result by the total standard monthly system
              available. Monthly system availability rates and associated maintenance credits are as follows see 3(c):



              |System Availability Rate                     |System Maintenance Credit                            |

          investigation, provided a break in service of more than 24 months has not occurred, and the personnel security investigation has been
          completed and favorably adjudicated (or a favorable local contractor fitness determination has been made).

      (2) For IT-II Access:  No classified work will be required. However, the contractor will be working with sensitive information which is
covered by the Privacy Act or other government regulations and is considered category IT-II. The contractor must ensure sensitive information
is properly safeguarded at the work site and not removed from the work-site. In addition, the contractor will be required to comply with the
security requirements associated with access to the DFAS enterprise network and sensitive agency information. All contractor personnel
requiring IT-II access to the DFAS information systems will be subject to a National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) personnel
security investigation, equivalent level investigation, or higher level personnel security investigation. An IT-II access position may be
occupied upon completion of the personnel security investigation and upon a favorable local contractor fitness determination for access to IT
systems and sensitive agency information. An exception waiver of pre-appointment investigative requirements can be granted in application with
DoD 5200.2-R, if the following are met:
        • the COR has requested an exception waiver in writing, based upon a determination by the head of the requesting organizations that
          delay in appointment would be harmful to national security [exception waiver can be requested by the COR on the Contractor Request
          for Investigation (CRI) form] and has submitted the exception waiver request to the local SSSO; and
        • the NACLC investigation has been initiated and favorable advance NAC or fingerprint results have been received from the investigating
          agency.

     (c) Documentation Submission. The NACLC for IT-II access, as well as the PTSBI for IT-I access, requires contractor submission of the
following investigative forms and documentation:




         • Standard Form 85P (SF 85P) - Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions
         • FD 258 - Applicant Fingerprint Card
         • Contractor Request for Investigation Form (CRI), DFAS Form 9035
         • Photocopies of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) documentation

All contractor personnel requiring either IT-I or IT-II access to the DFAS information systems and/or sensitive agency information will complete
a SF 85P. The SF 85P will be completed using the Adobe Fillable version of the form located at http://www.opm.gov/forms/html/sf.asp . The
completed/signed SF85P will be provided to the COR or Government Point of Contact (GPOC), elsewhere named in this solicitation. The COR/GPOC
personnel will complete a CRI containing, but not limited to: the full name of the contractor applicant; the contract number and expiration
date; the name(s) of the designated COR; and level of IT access required as determined previously in the Statement of Work or Performance Work
Statement. All SF 85Ps and CRIs must be accompanied by the FD 258, Applicant Finger Print Card, and photocopies of documentation that the
COR/GPOC have used to validate the contractor personnel applicant's PIV. In accordance with USNORTHCOM Antiterrorism (AT) Operations Order 05-
01B, dated 7/16/2006, identity credential vetting is required for access permission of contractor personnel. To meet this requirement for PIV
vetting, the contractor applicant must provide two forms of identification from the list of acceptable documents based upon the Form I-9,
Employment Eligibility Verification. At least one of the documents shall be a valid State or Federal Government issued picture identification.
The COR or GPOC will validate the documents and provide photocopies of the vetted PIV documentation as part of the documentation submission for
investigation. The SF85P, FD258, CRI, and proof of PIV will be forwarded to the local SSSO for review and/or submission. The SSSO or Central
Personnel Security Office will notify the COR/GPOC when the contractor applicant has been approved for access to sensitive information. The
appropriate personnel security investigation (NACLC or PTSBI) must be completed or an exception waiver of pre-appointment investigative
requirement approved, in accordance with DoD 5200.2-R, before the contractor personnel applicant begins work on a DFAS contract.

    (d) Findings.  All contractor personnel applicants must receive a favorable local contractor personnel fitness determination (or favorable
adjudication) to work on DFAS contracts. Unfavorable local fitness determinations (or unfavorable adjudications) will require the removal of
the contractor employee from an IT-I or IT-II designated DFAS contract. An unfavorable local fitness determination only precludes the
contractor employee from having access to sensitive DFAS IT systems or sensitive agency data. The local contractor fitness determination is not
security adjudication. Therefore, the contractor personnel applicant is not afforded administrative due process by the agency.

    (e) Training.  Following contract award, all contractor personnel are required to complete Antiterrorism Level I, Combating Trafficking in
Persons, and Information Security training on an annual basis (Reference DoDI 2000.16, Standard 25; DoDI 2200.01, paragraph 5; and DoD 5200.1-
R, Chapter 9).  The aforementioned training will be available through the DFAS ePortal.

SOLICITATION PROVISION:

DFAS 52.223-9000, “ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PRODUCTS” (OCT 2007)

The Environmentally Preferable Products clause is included in this contract to articulate the Government’s polices on Green Contracting.  FAR
23.403 sets forth the Federal Government’s policy to acquire items composed of the highest percentage of recycled-content practical, in a cost
effective manner while still obtaining other contracting goals.  Recycled-content products are identified in the Environmental Protection
Agency’s Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs).  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be producing a similar list which
designates Bio-based products.  EPA guideline items (and USDA designated bio-based products, when designated) are seen as the minimum that
should be considered when evaluating environmentally preferable materials.  Other environmentally preferable materials and products not listed,
but commonly used in industry outside of the Government, should also be considered.

The recently issued Executive Order 13423 (January 24, 2007) requires federal agencies to use sustainable environmental practices, including
acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content products.  Moreover, it now
requires that paper of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content must be acquired or used in Agency acquisitions of goods and services.

§ 1.        Mandatory use of Paper and other products with recycled content.
All paper utilized in the performance of this contract must be of at least 30 percent post-consumer fiber content.
The contractor, by responding to this RFP/RFQ, affirmatively acknowledges that they will, to the maximum extent practicable, use sustainable
environmental practices including acquisition of bio-based, environmentally preferable, energy-efficient, water-efficient, and recycled-content
products in the performance of this contract that meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items, which are found at
http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/procure/products.htm.   In addition, by responding to this RFQ/RFP the contractor is certifying the
deliverables required under this contract shall meet the recycled-content recommendations for EPA designated items.

§ 2   Notice of Green alternatives in Offerors’ product/service.
When offering a product or service that contains Green components as that term is defined at http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-
hw/procure/products.htm,
the contractor shall make the Contracting Officer aware of such facts in the submission of their proposal or proposal.
(b)   The contractor, when appropriate, shall comply with FAR Clause 52.223-9 Estimate of Percentage of Recovered Material Content for EPA
Designated Products.

§ 2   Affirmative Duty of Contractors to adhere to Green Contracting Policy.
Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to examine its packaging to eliminate or reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or
weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable material for non-recyclable material in packaging.
(b)   Whenever practicable, the Contractor has an affirmative duty to find other materials utilized in the delivery of services under this
contract and examine whether it can reduce waste by volume, toxicity and/or weight and to utilize or substitute recyclable materials for non-
recyclable materials of items consumed in the furnishing of their services.
