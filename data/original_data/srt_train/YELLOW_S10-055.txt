      are considered to be foreign travel.  Additionally, foreign travel will be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation
      and the Federal Travel Regulations, prescribed by the U.S. Department of State as defined below:


      Documentation (i.e. itemized receipts) to support all actual travel costs  incurred  will  be  provided  with  each  invoice  request.   In
      addition, identify all travelers, dates of travel, destination, and purpose of trip.  See Travel  Request  Attachment  and  Travel  Expense
      Report Attachment.


      Lodging
      Domestic and foreign lodging will be reimbursed for actual expenses, not to exceed the maximum lodging per diem permitted  by  the  Federal
      Travel Regulation.  All requests for reimbursement of lodging expenses must be supported by a receipt.  Domestic lodging per diem rates can
      be accessed at the General Services Administration website www.gsa.gov by clicking on “Per Diem Rates”.  Foreign lodging per diem rates can
      be accessed at the U.S. Department of State website www.state.gov by clicking on “Per Diem Rates” under Quick  Links.   Domestic  per  diem
      rates do not include lodging taxes.  Actual taxes associated with lodging will be reimbursed provided a receipt is made available.  Foreign
      per diem rates include all lodging taxes.  Actual lodging expenses will only be reimbursed up to the FTR foreign lodging per diem amount.


      A deviation from the allowable lodging per diem may be requested in certain situations.  Examples of situations warranting such a deviation
      are: 1) when a conference, seminar or meeting is held at a hotel that does not offer rates within the Federal Travel Regulation, 2) lodging
      expenses are offset by savings in transportation expenses, 3) government per diem rates are not available or obtainable at the destination.
       All requests for deviations from the maximum lodging per diem rate require Contracting Officer approval prior to travel.


      In the event the traveler deviates from the allowable lodging per diem rate in effect at the time of travel, and is not  a  result  of  the
      warranted deviations suggested above, the traveler will be reimbursed up to the maximum lodging per diem rate and will  absorb  any  excess
      cost over the approved per diem rate.  Subcontractor will be responsible for excess costs and any additional expenses incurred for personal
      preference or convenience.  A receipt must still be provided for reimbursement up to the maximum allowable per diem rate.


      Meals and Incidental Expenses
      Meals and incidental expenses (M&IE) for domestic and foreign travel will be reimbursed according to the maximum  allowable  per  diem  for
      meals and incidental expenses as determined by the Federal Travel Regulation.  Domestic meals and incidental per diem rates can be accessed
      at the General Service Administration website www.gsa.gov and by clicking on “Per Diem Rates”.  Foreign meals and incidental per diem rates
      can be accessed at the U.S. Department of State website www.state.gov by clicking on “Travel and Business” and then  clicking  on  “Foreign
      Per Diem Rates”.  M&IE rates cover expenses for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and related tips and fees.  Incidentals are  used  for  fees  and
      tips given to porters, baggage carriers, bellhops, hotel maids  and  dining  room  stewards/stewardesses.   The  allowance  for  meals  and
      incidental expenses (M&IE) on the first and last day of travel will be 75% of the applicable  M&IE  rate  for  both  domestic  and  foreign
      travel.  Specifically excluded costs that are non reimbursable are alcoholic beverage and entertainment expenses, and any expenses incurred
      for other persons.


      Airfare Costs
      For air travel, coach-class or equivalent must be utilized.  All travel, both Foreign and  Domestic  must  use  a  U.S.  Flag  air  carrier
      service.  In special or unusual situations, airfare costs in excess of coach-class or equivalent may be allowable only upon a  written  and
      warranted justification for use of the higher amounts.  All requests for  accommodations  other  than  coach-class  or  equivalent  require
      Contracting Officer approval prior to travel.


      Mileage Costs
      The cost of using a private automobile will be reimbursed in accordance with the current “Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) Reimbursement Rate”
      as set forth in the Federal Travel Regulation, prescribed by the General  Service  Administration  www.gsa.gov.   (Click  on  “POV  Mileage
      Reimbursement Rates.”)  The rate covers all costs of operation of the automobile.  Mileage is based on the standard miles of the  “shortest
      route” as indicated by commercially available websites providing driving directions.  Provide the printout  from  the  website  used  which
      shows the resulting mileage.


      Automobile Rentals
      Requests for rental cars are to be included in the original travel package with appropriate justification.  Approval from  the  Contracting
      Officer must be obtained prior to any automobile rentals.  Costs specifically excluded and non reimbursable are  the  costs  of  purchasing
      extra collision or personal liability insurance, GPS systems, bike racks or ski racks.


      Miscellaneous Costs
      The use of taxis, shuttles, and other public transportation will be reimbursed at actual cost.  Parking and tolls incurred while  traveling
      will be reimbursed at actual cost; however, the most economical means for parking must be utilized.  Garage or valet parking  will  not  be
      reimbursed, unless this is the only option or a special need justifies this sort of parking.   Receipts are required for  reimbursement  of
      all transportation expenses.

Section C- Statement of Work

1. GENERAL BACKGROUND

THE NCI THROUGH ITS CENTER FOR BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  (NCI  CBIIT)  HAS  SPONSORED  THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  THE  CANCER
BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS GRID® (CABIG®) INITIATIVE, A COMMON INFORMATICS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT INCORPORATES AND ENCOURAGES THE  USE  OF  COMMON  DATA
STANDARDS. CABIG® IS AN OPEN SOURCE, OPEN ACCESS INFORMATION NETWORK CONNECTING THE CANCER RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND ENABLING THE  SHARING  OF  DATA
AND TOOLS.  USING THE CABIG® INFRASTRUCTURE, RESEARCHERS AND CLINICIANS CAN ACCELERATE THEIR ABILITY TO SHARE, INTEGRATE AND  ANALYZE  DATA.   BY
PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION OF INTEROPERABLE SOFTWARE TOOLS,  DATA  STANDARDS,  AND  COMPUTING  INFRASTRUCTURE,  THE  CABIG®  INITIATIVE
PROMOTES DATA AND KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE, SIMPLIFIES COLLABORATION, AND ULTIMATELY HELPS REALIZE THE POTENTIAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE.

The NCI supports a broad initiative to standardize the common data elements (CDEs) and associated metadata used in cancer research  data  capture
and reporting. This metadata is specified according to the ISO/IEC 11179 standard for  metadata  definition  and  registration.    Curators  from
various domains of cancer research of these domains manage their CDEs and associated metadata in separate logical divisions in the caDSR,  called
Contexts.  Each Context has its own curatorial authority and governance mechanism for  content  development  and  approval;  business  rules  and
approaches to curation and maintenance of content are harmonized at the registry level.  The largest Context in  terms  of  numbers  of  CDEs  is
managed by the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid or caBIG®.  Work to produce standardized metadata  for  cancer  prevention  trials,  biomedical
imaging, biomarker studies, early phase clinical trials, genomic research, population sciences and epidemiology,  and  the  measure  of  patient-
centered outcomes has advanced dramatically in the past two years.

The required metadata is stored from several sources in caDSR. The caDSR Context administrators and curators meet with NCI  CBIIT  on  a  regular
basis (every two weeks) to exchange information and ideas.  The group has advanced the  process  of  creating  a  unified,  shared  set  of  best
practices for CDE and metadata development, and has furthered the process of eliminating redundancy with the caDSR. In addition, this  group  has
been (with the current vendor) organizing the content of the caDSR into categories and other groupings to support searches  from  the  community.
Additional harmonization has occurred/is occurring for metadata attributes such as ‘origin’,  ‘representation’,  and  ‘conceptual  domain’.   The
semantic structure of CDEs has been assessed using increasingly structured methodology to validate that the controlled vocabulary used to  create
the elements is registered, fully defined, and appropriately used to create CDEs.  The concept of reusability has been  adopted  by  the  context
curators, with extensive efforts made to promote reuse of CDEs and supporting  metadata  beyond  the  owning  context.   Business  processes  and
workflow are being reviewed as regular agenda items, along with metadata standards for the community.

The NCI is entering the fourth year and the enterprise phase of the Cancer Biomedical Informatics  Grid  (caBIG®).   caBIG®  represents  a  large
expansion of the NCI CBIIT mission. Several curators are involved in the  creation  of  CDEs  and  associated  metadata  for  caBIG®  trials  and
applications.  The curators work with the available UML models in caDSR. At times, this specific step  in  the  process  is  cumbersome  for  the
participating organizations. The curators will act as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for software/engineering teams while  verifying  caDSR  tools
development and enhancement requirements. In addition to this, they will perform the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) prior to releases and  provide
feedback pertaining to tools interface points and design. The contractor may provide support in eliminating these issues and work with the  stake
holders to improve the process. More information on caBIG® can be found at http://cabig.nci.nih.gov.  The activities in this context have  driven
recent activities to harmonize curation approaches between the manual and model-driven tools in caDSR.

Several public standards organizations are tackling  complementary  and  overlapping  problems  in  biomedical  informatics.  There  are  several
overlapping and complimentary standards to NCI CDE projects. Some of the examples are…

    • Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC): This project defines  data  interchange  standards  for  laboratory  and  clinical
      observations (http://www.loinc.org).

    • Health Level Seven (HL7): The standards authority governing electronic messaging has broadened its scope to  include  information  modeling
      (http://www.hl7.org).

    • Case Report Forms (CRFs): These forms are meant to capture and report clinical trials data to FDA. The  non-harmonized  CRF  variables  are
      shared with caBIG® community Study Conduct (SIG) and ultimately, adopted by the wider community of caBIG® adopters and  collaborators.  The
      ontology to support variables will be an initial step during CDE development. As the next step, the variables will be reviewed and approved
      by CTMS through consensus and ontology will be added.

2. Objectives

THIS STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) DESCRIBES FOUR MAJOR OBJECTIVES:

 • The first objective is to provide the resource needed to assist DCP, CCR, and other NCI and NIH organizational units in managing their CDE and
   associated metadata activities.  These include the Cancer Imaging Program, NHLBI, NIDCR, and CDISC.

 • The second objective is to work with the Context administrators to continue to create and maintain standard, ISO/IEC 11179 Standard compliant,
   non-redundant CDEs and metadata across all the caDSR Contexts. Terminology for CDE development should come from the NCI Enterprise  Vocabulary
   Services.  As part of this harmonization process, a common classification system and organization that can  be  used  to  organize  the  CDEs,
   forms, templates, and metadata content across Contexts in the caDSR needs to be established.

 • The third objective is to continue to ‘clean up’ and retire appropriately metadata in  caDSR  that  is  not  appropriate  for  continued  use.
   Decisions about the extent of revision that is necessary while making prospective changes need to be based on the consensus  of  the  curators
   and context administrators, as well as reflected in business practice guidelines.  A formal metrics plan was created by the content  group  in
   2007; this plan should be followed as one approach to quality control, and the development of prescriptive best practices.

 • The fourth objective is to supply metadata support to caBIG® as needed.  This  includes  curation  support  for  forms  and  UML  based  CDEs,
   standards package creation, training and any other tasks  relevant  to  such  support.   The  NCI  CBIIT,  SAIC-Frederick  (SAIC-F),  and  the
   Subcontractor will partner in this activity, to 1) identify metadata standards that need to be promoted within the caBIG® community, 2) review
   existing external standards and use cases, and 3) create documentation and supporting details for approved standards.  An additional component
   of this task is the need for a regular review and update mechanism for existing standards.

3. Scope of Work

AT A HIGH LEVEL, NCI IS LOOKING TO ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING TASKS:
    • CDE life cycle management and support (planning/management, processes, and technical support).
    • Metadata support for caBIG® program.
    • A resource to manage CDE and metadata curation activities.
    • As needed, enhancement of CDE curation and harmonization methodology.
    • Implementation of new metadata services and tools.

4. Project Description and Requirements

   THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY EXPERTISE IN HARMONIZING CDES ACROSS THE CABIG® INITIATIVE. SIMILARLY, THERE IS
   A STRONG NEED TO WORK WITH EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS TO HARMONIZE THEIR DATA.  THE  UNDERLYING  MOTIVATION  OF  THIS  EFFORT  IS  TO  ENABLE  THE
   ORGANIZATIONS TO EXCHANGE THE INFORMATION IN A STANDARD MANNER WHILE UTILIZING CABIG® INFRASTRUCTURE.

The Subcontractor shall furnish the National Cancer Institute Center for Biomedical Informatics  and  Information  Technology  (NCI  CBIIT)  with
professional service experts.  These experts will work directly with the CDE and caDSR project team members, and in  fact  will  become  part  of
that team.   The Subcontractor’s staff shall raise issues, conduct discussions, perform analyses, make recommendations, forge consensus,  produce
documentation, implement processes, and use the caDSR related tools to achieve the Objectives of this SOW.  The  experts  are  expected  to  have
knowledge and past experience with metadata development, ideally using the ISO/IEC 11179 standard, and to understand the subtle distinctions  and
relationships between metadata standards and controlled vocabulary standards. Biomedical domain expertise in clinical and basic science  is  also
required.  The Subcontractor staff shall complete all required training and ongoing professional development required for the completion  of  CDE
and associated metadata curation, and to function as curator preceptors for members of the community who complete metadata curation training.

      Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element (including  photographs,  charts  and  equations)  in  all  publications  prepared  in
      electronic format. Use descriptions such as “alt” and “longdesc” for all non-text  images  or  place  them  in  element  content.  For  all
      documents prepared, Subcontractors must prepare one standard HTML format as described in this statement of work AND one  text  format  that
      includes descriptions for all non-text images. “Text equivalent” means text sufficient to reasonably describe the image.  Images  that  are

Buyer furnished property.  Buyer may, for any reason, direct Seller to suspend, in whole  or  in  part,  delivery  of  goods  or  performance  of
services hereunder for such period of time as may be determined by Buyer in its sole discretion.  If any  such  change  or  suspension  causes  a
material increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for the performance of any part of the work under  this  Order,  an  equitable
adjustment shall be made in the Order price or delivery schedule, or both, provided Seller shall have notified Buyer in writing of any claim  for
such adjustment within twenty (20) days from the date of notification of the change or suspension from Buyer.  No such adjustment  or  any  other
modification of the terms of this Order will be allowed unless authorized by Buyer by means of a  written  modification  to  the  Order.   Seller

or to Buyer, Seller will obtain the written permission of Buyer with respect thereto.

15.   Confidential Information
Seller shall not at any time, even after the expiration or termination of this Order, use or disclose to any person for any  purpose  other  than
to perform this Order, any information it receives, directly or indirectly from Buyer in connection with this Order, except information  that  is
or becomes publicly available, or is rightfully received by Seller from a third party without restriction. Upon request by  Buyer,  Seller  shall
return to Buyer all documentation and other material containing such information.

16.   Indemnification
Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from and against any and all claims,  liabilities,  damages,  losses,  causes  of  action,
lawsuits, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation costs incurred in connection therewith and regardless of  legal
theory (hereinafter referred to as ”claims”), occasioned wholly or in part by any act or omission of Seller or any of its lower tiers,  or  their
employees, agents or representatives arising out of or relating to this Order.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller’s  obligations  under  this
Section shall not apply to any claims that are finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be occasioned solely by the  negligence
or willful misconduct of Buyer.

      17. Infringement Indemnities
Seller shall, at its expense, indemnify, defend, save and hold Buyer and its successors,  affiliates,  officers,  directors,  employees,  agents,
independent contractors and customers, and the officers, agents and employees of such customers (hereinafter collectively  referred  to  in  this
section as “Buyer”)  harmless from and against any and all damages, liabilities, penalties, interest and costs  awarded  against  and  reasonable
expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees that result or arise  out  of  or  relate  to,  in  whole  or  part,  any  claims,  suits,
proceedings, actions, causes of action and demands brought against the  Buyer  asserting  that  the  deliverables,  including  without  delivery,
including without limitation all software, goods or services, or any part thereof, furnished under this Order, or  the  creation,  delivery,  use
modification, reproduction, release,  performance,  display  or  disclosure,  including   without  limitation  resale  or  sublicensing  thereof,
constitutes an infringement of any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary or intellectual property right  or  rights  of
privacy or publicity.  In the event such goods or services or use thereof are enjoined in whole or in part,  Seller  shall  at  its  expense  and
Buyer’s option undertake one of the following: (a) obtain for Buyer the right to continue the use of such goods or  services;  (b)  in  a  manner
acceptable to Buyer, substitute equivalent goods or services or make modifications thereto so as to  avoid  such  infringement  and  extend  this
indemnity thereto; or (c)  refund to Buyer an amount equal to the purchase price for such goods or services plus any  excess  costs  or  expenses
incurred in obtaining substitute goods or services from another source.

Notwithstanding this Section 17, should the deliverables or portion thereof be held to constitute an infringement  and  use  as  contemplated  by
this Order be enjoined or be threatened to be enjoined, Seller shall notify Buyer and immediately, at Seller’s expense;  (i)  procure  for  Buyer
the right to continue to use the deliverables or portion thereof with a  version  that  is  non-infringing,  provided  that  the  replacement  or
modified version meets any applicable specifications to Buyer’s satisfaction.  If (a) or (b) are not available to  Seller,  in  addition  to  any
damages or expenses reimbursed under this section, Seller shall refund to Buyer all amounts paid to Seller by Buyer under this Order.

18.   Non-Waiver Of Rights
The failure of Buyer to insist upon strict performance of any of the terms and conditions in this Order or to exercise any  rights  or  remedies,
shall not be construed as a waiver of its rights to assert any of same or to rely on any  such  terms  or  conditions  at  any  time  thereafter.
Acceptance or payment of any part of the Order shall not bind Buyer to accept future shipments or performance of services nor  deprive  Buyer  of
the right to return goods already accepted or for which Buyer has made payment.  Acceptance or payment shall not be deemed  to  be  a  waiver  of
Buyer’s right to cancel or return all or any part of the goods because of failure to conform to the  Order  or  by  reason  of  defects,  whether
latent or patent, or other breach of warranty, or to make any claim for damages of any and all kind.

19.   Reserved

20. Export Control Compliance For Foreign Persons
Seller shall not, nor shall Seller authorize or permit its employees,  agents  or  lower  tiers  to  disclose,  export  or  re-export  any  Buyer
information, or any process, product or services that is produced under this Order, without prior notification to Buyer and  complying  with  all
applicable Federal, State and local laws, regulations and ordinances, including the regulations of the U.S. Department  of  Commerce  and/or  the
U.S. Department of State.  In addition, Seller agrees to immediately notify Buyer if Seller  is  listed  on  any  of  the  Department  of  State,
Treasury or Commerce proscribed persons or destinations lists, or if Seller’s export privileges are otherwise denied,  suspended  or  revoked  in
whole or in part.

Under its contract with NCI-Frederick, Buyer conducts research activities that  include  export-controlled  technology  that  cannot  be  readily
segregated.  Buyer may require Seller (including any lower tiers) to place restrictions on their work force performing onsite at  SAIC-Frederick,
Inc. to protected individuals as established under the guidelines of the Commerce Department Export  Administration  Regulations  (EAR)  and  the
State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

Contractors (including any lower tiers) may be required to disclose the status of personnel proposed to perform work onsite prior to award.

Contractors shall include in all agreements and related documents with lower tiers, notice to third parties  that  the  export  of  any  process,
goods and/or technical data from the United States may require an export control license from the U.S. Government and  that,  failure  to  obtain
such export control license may result in termination of Order, and/or criminal liability under U.S. laws.

  21. ASSIGNMENT
Neither this Order nor any interest herein may be assigned, in whole or in part, without the prior written  consent  of  Buyer  except  that  the
Seller shall have the right to assign this Order to any successor of such party  by  way  of  merger  or  consolidation  or  the  acquisition  of
substantially all of the business and assets of the Seller relating to the subject matter of this Order.  This right shall be  retained  provided
that such successor shall expressly assume all of the obligations and liabilities of the Seller under this  Order,  and  that  the  Seller  shall
remain liable and responsible to Buyer for the performance and observance of all such obligations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amounts due the Seller may be assigned in accordance with the provisions of the clause  52.232-23,  Assignment
of Claims.

In the event the prime contract of SAIC-Frederick, Inc. with the Government is succeeded by a successor contractor selected  by  the  Government,
this Order may be assigned to the successor contractor.

22.   Disputes
(A) If a decision relating to the Prime Contract is made by the NCI-Frederick Contracting Officer and such  decision  is  also  related  to  this
Order, said decision, if binding upon Buyer under the Prime Contract shall in turn be binding upon Buyer and Seller with respect to such  matter;
provided, however, that if Seller disagrees with any such decision made by the NCI Contracting Officer and Buyer elects not to  appeal  any  such
decision, Seller shall have the right reserved to Buyer under the Prime Contract with the Government to prosecute a timely appeal in the name  of
Buyer, as permitted by the contract or by law, Seller to bear its own legal and other costs.  If Buyer elects not to appeal  any  such  decision,
Buyer agrees to notify Seller in a timely fashion after receipt of such decision and to assist Seller in its prosecution of any  such  appeal  in
every reasonable manner.  If Buyer elects to appeal any such decision of the NCI Contracting Officer, Buyer agrees to furnish Seller promptly  of
a copy of such appeal. Any decision upon appeal, if binding upon Buyer, shall in turn  be  binding  upon  Seller.   Pending  the  making  of  any
decision, either by the NCI Contracting Officer or on appeal, Seller shall proceed diligently with performance of this Order.

If, as a result of any decision or judgment whish is binding upon Seller and Buyer, as provided above, Buyer  is  unable  to  obtain  payment  or
reimbursement from the Government under the Prime Contract for, or is required to refund or credit to the Government, any amount with respect  to
any item or matter for which the Buyer has  reimbursed  or  paid  Seller,  Seller  shall,  on  demand,  promptly  repay  such  amount  to  Buyer.
Additionally, pending the final conclusion of any appeal hereunder, Seller shall, on demand promptly repay any such  amount  to  Buyer.   Buyer’s
maximum liability for any matter connected with or related to this Order which was properly the subject of a claim against the  Government  under
the Prime Contract shall not exceed the amount of the Buyer’s recovery from the Government.

Seller agrees to provide certification that data supporting any claim made by Seller hereunder is made in good  faith  and  that  the  supporting
data is accurate and complete to the best of the Seller’s knowledge or belief, all in accordance with the requirements of the Contracts  Disputes
Act of 1978 (41USC601-613) and implementing regulations. If any claim of Seller is determined to be based on  upon  fraud  or  misrepresentation,
Seller agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Buyer harmless for any and all liability, loss, cost, or expense resulting there from.

Any dispute not addressed in paragraph (A) above, will be subject to paragraph (B) as described below.

(B) Buyer and Seller agree to first enter into negotiations to resolve any controversy, claim or dispute (“dispute”) arising  under  or  relating
to this Order.  The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of such dispute within a reasonable  period
of time.  If good faith negotiations are unsuccessful, Buyer and Seller agree to  resolve  the  dispute  by  binding  and  final  arbitration  in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  The arbitration  shall  take  place  in
the County of Frederick, State of Maryland.  The arbitrator(s) shall be bound to follow the provisions of this Order in  resolving  the  dispute,
and may not award punitive damages.  The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be  final  and  binding  on  the  parties,  and  any  award  of  the
arbitrator(s) may be entered or enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Seller hereby waives any immunity, sovereign or otherwise, that it would otherwise  have  to  such  jurisdiction  and  agrees  that  its  rights,
obligations, and liabilities hereunder shall be determined in the same manner and to the same extent as those of a private  litigant  under  like
circumstances.

All costs of the arbitration shall be shared equally between the Parties, but the Parties specifically agree  that  each  Party  shall  bear  the
expense of any costs incurred by it for its own counsel, experts, witnesses, preparation of documents, presentations, and  logistics  related  to
the proceedings.

Pending any decision, appeal or judgment referred to in this provision or the settlement of any dispute arising under this  Order,  Seller  shall
proceed diligently with the performance of this Order.

23.   Notification Of Debarment/Suspension
By acceptance of this Order either in writing or by performance, Seller certifies that as of the date of award of this Order neither the  Seller,
lower tiers, nor any of its principals, is debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment  by  the  Federal  Government.  Further,  Seller  shall
provide immediate written notice to the Buyer in the event that during performance of  this  Order  the  Seller  or  any  of  its  principals  is
debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment by the Federal Government.

24.   Quality Assurance/Inspection
All goods furnished and services performed pursuant hereto shall be subject to inspection and test by Buyer at all reasonable times  and  places,
during the Order term, and in any event, prior to Final Acceptance as that term is defined in the Statement of Work.  No  inspection  made  prior
to Final Acceptance shall relieve Seller from responsibility for defects or other to meet the failure requirements of this Order.  In  the  event
that goods furnished or services supplied are not in accordance with the Statement of  Work  and  Schedule  or  other  requirements.   Buyer  may
require Seller to promptly correct, repair, replace or re-perform the goods or services.  The cost of correction,  repair,  replacement,  or  re-
performance shall be determined under Section 7 of this Order.  If Seller fails to proceed with reasonable promptness  to  perform  the  required
correction, repair, replacement, or re-performance, Buyer may terminate the Order for default.  If Seller is unable to accomplish the  foregoing,
then Buyer may procure such materials and services from another source or perform such services in-house  and  charge  to  Seller’s  account  all
costs, expenses and damages associated therewith.  Buyer’s approval of designs furnished by Seller shall not relieve Seller  of  its  obligations
hereunder.

25.   Order Of Precedence
In the event of an inconsistency or conflict between these SAIC Terms and Conditions and the Order issued, the inconsistency  or  conflict  shall
be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:

1)    The Order including SAIC-Frederick, Inc. Standard Terms and Conditions, Exhibits thereto and any provisions.
2)    Specifications and/or drawings.
3)    Other documents or exhibits when attached.

26.   Termination
   Termination for Convenience

                                                           SUBCONTRACTING CERTIFICATION

In accordance with the terms of its prime contract under which a resulting award will be issued, SAIC-Fredrick is committed to  maximizing  small
business subcontracting opportunities to the maximum extent practicable.  In pursuit of this objective  please  complete,  and  include  in  your
technical proposal, the following certification providing the percentage of effort that will be conducted by in-house, employee personnel  during
the execution of the statement of work as provided herein (including any option tasks/periods, as applicable):




*If the percentage of work to be conducted by employees of your organization is less than 100% a small business subcontracting plan as  described
in FAR 19.704 should be provided with your proposal and must be accepted by SAIC-Frederick prior to subcontract award.   Failure  to  provide  an
acceptable subcontracting plan in a timely manner may render your organization ineligible for subcontract award.

                                                                   ATTACHMENT 3

           equipment separate from general purpose equipment.  Prepare and attach form entitled: Report of Capitalized  Nonexpendable  Equipment
           included in this contract.

           -     The item number for the specific piece of equipment listed in the Property Schedule.
           -     The Contracting Officer’s approval letter and number, if the equipment is not covered by the Property Schedule.
           -     Be preceded by an asterisk (*) if the equipment is below the approval level.  Further itemization of  invoices  shall  only  be

        is travel outside of Canada, the United States and its territories and possessions.  However, for an organization located outside Canada,
        the United States and its territories and possessions, foreign travel means travel outside that country.  Foreign travel must  be  billed
        separately from domestic travel. (Attach travel expense report)

    (7)     Subcontract Costs — List subcontractor(s) by name and amount billed. Describe services provided.  (Attach subcontractor invoices)

PURPOSE

The caBIG® (caBIG®) Data Sharing Plan presents information about the data that the adopting institution will  share  via  the  caGrid,  including
how, with whom, and when the data will be shared.  The plan establishes the nature of the data for purposes of  determining  the  sensitivity  of
the data (related to legal and ethical restrictions on data exchange, intellectual property value, and  contractual  obligations)  and  thus  the
access controls necessary to secure the data.  The data sharing  plan  also  presents  information  about  the  institution’s  internal  approval
processes for sharing data outside of the institution.  That information is used to deepen the understanding  of  the  broader  caBIG®  community
about data sharing practices in general and to assist the individual adoption project and researcher in securing approval to share data.

The following list of topics to address is intended as a guideline or checklist to assist the researcher in preparing a  Data  Sharing  Plan  for
use in a caBIG® adoption project.

CONTENT OF THE DATA SHARING PLAN

I.    Background of the Institution and the project that is adopting caBIG® tools and using the caGrid to share data
         • Describe the institution that is conducting the research (may be a unit or department of a larger institution):
               o Will any or all of the data be collected specifically for the current project?
               o If the data already exist, do any or all of the data to be shared fall within the  Common  Rule  definition  of  human  subjects
                 research?
               o Is your institution a covered entity as defined by the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability  Act
                 of 1996 (i.e., has your institution determined that it is subject to the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule)?
         •  Describe the purpose and objectives of the project, the tools that will be adopted, and how the tools are expected to  help  achieve
           the purpose and objectives.
         • Describe any sponsors (Federal, State, or private), collaborators, or others with regulatory,  financial,  intellectual  property  or
           other interests or rights to the data produced in the study or the data to be used in the study.

II.   Information about the data involved in the project and how they will be shared
         • Describe, with some specificity, the data that are intended to be shared, the source(s) of the data (e.g., mouse  data,  tissue  bank
           specimens and annotations, imaged/annotated data, clinical trial or retrospective data from a study  in  progress,  existing  regular
           medical records, archived data).
         •  If the institution (or relevant component) is covered by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, state whether the health information to  be  shared
           includes direct identifiers, or only limited or de-identified data sets, as defined by the Rule (see chart below for  guidance).   If
           the dataset is de-identified, describe the process, whether manual or automated, used to de-identify it.
         • If the institution is subject to regulations governing health data privacy or restricting access to  certain  data  such  as  genetic
           data, describe any restrictions.
         •  Describe different expected levels of data access (e.g., public access, group or consortium access,  or  private  access,  which  is
           generally limited to the originators of the data and/or individually authorized and  authenticated  individuals/institutions).  (Note
           that certain federally funded research may be subject to specific data sharing/data access requirements in which case,  describe  the
           requirements and how the requirements will be met.)
         •  Describe the mechanism(s) for sharing the data such as whether the dataset will be a separate copy of data  exposed  to  shared  use
           outside of the institution’s security firewall or the data will be accessed through the firewall.
         • Describe any mechanisms in place within the institution (that is, mechanisms, if any, other than the authentication and authorization
           controls available either in the application itself or via the caGrid Common Security Module) that will be used for  limiting  access
           to authorized users.  Note any differences where different types of data sets (as described above) may be involved.
         •  Describe what controls the institution expects to place on access to the data, if any and how authorized access will be administered
           (e.g., will there be a requirement for registration of individual users who must “sign” (electronically or  physically)  a  data  use
           agreement, either a standard “click-through” agreement presented  by  caGrid  or  a  separately  negotiated  agreement  between  each
           prospective user and the research institution?)
         • When do you expect to share the particular data relative to the close of the study (e.g., within N months  after  the  close  of  the
           study to allow for data validation, immediately upon publication of the study which is expected to occur within N months of the close
           of the study, immediately upon submittal of a patent application which is expected to occur no later that N months after the close of
           the study), and by approximately what actual date would you expect the data to be shared?  Who will be responsible for releasing  the
           information?

III.  Information about the institutional units involved in approval to share data outside of the institution, including an IRB
         •  Are there internal organizations other than an IRB involved in approving the adoption project and sharing data  such  as  Technology
           Transfer Offices, Compliance, Privacy or Information Technology Security Offices, Legal Counsel, etc.?  If so, describe the steps and
           approximate timeframes of the process for securing all necessary approvals, including what information the organization  may  require
           regarding the project, caGrid security or the caBIG® program itself.
         • If there is an IRB involved in approving data sharing, describe the steps and approximate timeframes  involved  in  the  process  for
           securing approval to share the particular data involved in the adoption project, if any, including what information the  organization
           may require regarding the project, caGrid security or the caBIG® program itself.
         • Does the IRB audit compliance with the options participants choose in the informed consent?

IV.   Provide information about any additional anticipated challenges, limitations, or other constraints on data sharing.
                                                           De-Identified Data Sets and
                                                                Limited Data Sets

The following chart describes the information that must be eliminated from a database, registry, or any other data set for the  data  set  to  be
considered “de-identified” or a “limited data set”. Appropriately de-identified data sets are not regulated by the HIPAA  Privacy  Rule.  Limited
data sets may be used or disclosed for research, public health, and other limited purposes, but only by those who sign  a  “data  use  agreement”
(signature may be written or electronic, depending on applicable state law and local institutional policy).  Note  that  for  each  data  element
listed below, the information must be eliminated with respect to the patient and to any of  the  patient’s  relatives,  employers,  or  household
members.

Important: Even if the HIPAA Privacy Rule does not regulate the use of a  dataset  or  permits  its  use  or  disclosure  for  research,  federal
regulations, institutional policies, and/or  state laws and regulations governing human subjects research  and  health  information  privacy  may
still apply.

*     Even if all of the information listed in this column is removed, if the researcher knows that any remaining information  in  the  data  set
 could be used to re-identify a patient (e.g., a diagnosis code where the disease is very  rare),  then  the  data  set  is  not  considered  de-
 identified.

†     If links must be maintained in the data set for potential later re-identification, they must be completely unrelated to any  of  the  above
 elements. For example, a patient’s initials or a scrambled social security number are not permitted in a de-identified data set. A subject  code
 that reflects the order in which subjects were enrolled into a trial would be permitted.
