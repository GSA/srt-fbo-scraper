Performance Work Statement For Contractor Support of the DISAM Distance Learning Program 1 GENERAL: This is a non-personal services contract to provide technical support to the Defense Institute of Security Assistance Management (DISAM) Distance Learning Development Staff by preparing training packages and course content in the form of text graphics, quizzes, animations, multimedia, scenarios or exercises, as well as multimedia games. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government.

1.1 Description of Services/Introduction: The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and nonpersonal services necessary to perform the services (Task 1 and Task 2) required as defined in this Performance Work Statement except for those items specified as government furnished property and services. The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract. 1.2 Background (Task 1): The Defense Institute of Security Assistance Management (DISAM) provides professional education, research, and support to advance U.S. foreign policy through a variety of security assistance and cooperation programs. In order to contend with a large course workload, heavy travel requirements, and limited instructional staff to meet worldwide security assistance and cooperation education requirements, DISAM is compelled to develop a distance learning (DL) program that incorporates both asynchronous and synchronous courses delivered through the Blackboard Learning Management System(LMS).The Defense Institute of Security Assistance Management (DISAM) provides training and education for the International Affairs community. DISAM is the organization responsible for identifying requirements for the development, implementation, and execution of international affairs certification for all DoD civilian and military personnel. DISAM currently has approximately 13 online courses available to its students. New courses are coming online every year. DISAM courses are currently developed using Adobe CS5 development software. DISAM is in the process of revising the method for delivering content to a format that will be easier to control and track within the Blackboard LMS environment. 1.3 Background ( Task 2): DISAM is currently in the process of revising and expanding the scope of the Security Cooperation Management Overseas (SCM-O) course. For a description of the course, click on this link http://www.disam.dsca.mil/disam1/external%20links/SCMO.asp#sylhttp://www.disam.dsca.mil/disam1/external%20links/SCM-O.asp . SCM-O provides a combination of resident classroom instruction and WBT. The target audience of the SCM-O course is primarily field grade military officers on assignment to overseas Security Cooperation Organizations (SCOs) in U.S. embassies around the world. Their primary mission is to conduct security assistance (SA) and security cooperation (SC)

HQ0013-11-R-0008 Page 4 of 75

activities with partner nations in support of U.S. national security policy. The SCO has a myriad of legal authorities (and thus SC programs) at its disposal. A major objective of the SCM-O is to expose students to the array of SC programs as well as how and when to utilize them to help the partner nation build its military capacity. The SCM-O course redesign will ensure that all of these various programs are covered in detail. 1.4 Objectives to Task 1: The purpose of this contract is to provide technical support service to DISAM in the development of the on-line learning system. The overall objective is for the contractor to work closely with the current DISAM staff to design, develop, and deliver interactive courseware, graphical elements, scenarios, quizzes, interactions, tests, prepare training package and presentations for members of the DoD Security Cooperation workforce. The training packages to be developed will include but are not limited to Computer-Based Training (CBT), Web Based Training (WBT), classroom lecture materials, interactive scenarios, and decision-making exercises. No contractor proprietary software/hardware will be used and all materials and software developed (inclusive of source code) under this contract shall become the property of DoD. 1.4.1 Task 1:The contractor shall work closely with DISAM Distance Learning Development staff to develop training packages specifically targeting different aspects of security cooperation. Additionally, the contractor will design course content for classroom courses. This content may take the form of text graphics, quizzes, animations, multimedia, scenarios or exercises, as well as multimedia games to be used in class as agreed to by DISAM during concept development. Contractor shall perform the following tasks:

1.4.1.1 Conversion of existing on line course content from current template to new templates as provided by DISAM. 1.4.1.2 Multimedia support to enhance lesson content, i.e. animation, video, interactions, scenarios, exercises and immersive learning exercises. 1.4.1.3 Convert existing content to Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliant in order to interface with the Blackboard LMS effectively. 1.4.1.4 Enhance existing course content to be more interactive and visually appealing. 1.4.1.5 Provide technical support to students regarding the Blackboard LMS to include resolving issues related to certificates, quizzes, login problems, course access, and others as deemed essential by the DISAM Program Manager. Issues related to course content will be passed to the course manager for resolution. 1.4.1.6 Conduct an analysis of existing resident and nonresident courses using Instructional System Designs (ISD) principles to identify areas of improvement within DISAMs course content. Assist DISAM faculty in implementing suggested improvements. 1.5 Objective Task 2: The objective of this contract is for a contractor to provide DISAM the technical support services required in the development of multimedia scenario-based exercises. 1.5.1 Task 2: The contractor shall design, develop, and integrate scenario-based exercises in support of the lesson objectives of the SCM-O course. The contractor will work with DISAM to develop scenario concepts, outlines, storyboards, prototypes, presentation

HQ0013-11-R-0008 Page 5 of 75

methodologies and integration into curriculum. The scenarios may be developed to be experienced by individuals, small groups, or as a whole class to be facilitated by an instructor. The scenarios shall be designed to afford students the opportunity to apply new knowledge learned in the classroom. The scenarios may involve other similar strategies such as problem-based learning, case-based learning, and worked examples. Each scenario will employ elements of immersion and be highly engaging to the learner. Construction of scenarios may be designed to be linear, branching, or some other framework. Students will be presented with a variety of scenarios related to topics at hand throughout the duration of the three week long class. Scenario-based exercises will be designed with a common thread such that new concepts build upon and reinforce previous concepts to provide a uniform flow throughout the course. 1.5.2 Period of Performance: The period of performance shall be for one (1) Base Year of 12 months and four (1) 12-month option years. The Period of Performance reads as follows:

October 1, 2011 thru September 30, 2012 (Base Year) October 1, 2012 thru September 30, 2013 (Option Year One) October 1, 2013 thru September 30, 2014 (Option Year Two) October 1, 2014 thru September 30, 2015 (Option Year Three) October 1, 2015 thru September 30, 2016 (Option Year Four) 1.6 General Information 1.6.1 Quality Control: The contractor shall develop and maintain an effective quality control program to ensure services are performed in accordance with this PWS.

Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.
