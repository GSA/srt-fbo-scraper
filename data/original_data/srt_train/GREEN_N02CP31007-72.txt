SECTION L - INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION a. INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION [FAR Provision 52.215-1 (January 2006)] (a) Definitions. As used in this provision-"Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. "In writing", "writing", or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. "Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals. (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision. (2) The first page of the proposal must show-(i) The solicitation number; (ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available); (iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item; (iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the offeror's behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and (v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal.

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 (i)Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modifications or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals.

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 (d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. (1) The proposal submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade secrets; business data (e.g., commercial information, financial information, cost and pricing data); and technical data) which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following statements, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be restricted: "Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), data contained in the portions of this proposal which the offeror has specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes. The offeror acknowledges that HHS may not be able to withhold a record (e.g. data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the HHS's FOI officials must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if HHS has determined that disclosure is required by the Act. If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act. The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act. The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages ( insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other identification)." (2) In addition, the offeror must mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following statement: "Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation." (3) Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive statements or statements differing in substance from those cited above may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with a nonconforming statement(s). (f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be - 45 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. (7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection; (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. (End of Provision) Alternate I (October 1997).As prescribed in 15.209(a)(1), substitute the following paragraph (f)(4) for paragraph (f)(4) of the basic provision: (f) (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly - 46 -

The following definitions are provided for your information: Hard Metric - - The replacement of a standard inch-pound size with an accepted metric size for a particular purpose. An example of size substitution might be: selling or packaging liquids by the liter instead of by the pint or quart (as for soft drinks), or instead of by the gallon (as for gasoline). Soft Metric - The result of a mathematical conversion of inch-pound measurements to metric equivalents for a particular purpose. The physical characteristics are not changed. Dual Systems - The use of both inch-pound and metric systems. For example, an item is designed, produced, and described in inch-pound values with soft metric values also shown for information or comparison purposes. 9. Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) issued final modifications to the "Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information," the "Privacy Rule," on August 14, 2002. The Privacy Rule is a federal regulation under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 that governs the protection of individually identifiable health information and is administered and enforced by the DHHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Those who must comply with the Privacy Rule (classified under the Rule as "covered entities" must do so by April 14, 2003 (with the exception of small health plans which have an extra year to comply. Decisions about the applicability and implementation of the Privacy Rule reside with the Contractor and his/her institution. The OCR Web site ( http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/) provides information of the Privacy Rule, including a complete Regulation Text and a set of decision tools on "Am I a covered entity?" Information on the impact of the HIPAA Privacy Rule on NIH processes involving the review, award, and administration of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts can be found at: http:// grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-025.html. 10. Privacy Act - Treatment of Proposal Information The Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information, the authority which authorizes the solicitation, whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used, the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information, and the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information. The NIH is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Sec. 301(a)(7) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended. Providing the information requested is entirely voluntary.

Selection of Offerors a. The acceptability of the technical portion of each contract proposal will be evaluated by a technical review committee. The committee will evaluate each proposal in strict conformity with the evaluation factors of the RFP, utilizing point scores and written critiques. The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an offeror. b. The business portion of each contract proposal will be subjected to a cost and price analysis, management analysis, etc. c. If award will be made without conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (e.g., the relevance of an offeror's past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors. d. If the Government intends to conduct discussions prior to awarding a contract 1. Communications will be held with offerors whose past performance information is the determining factor preventing them from being placed within the competitive range. Such communications shall address adverse past performance information to which an offeror has not had a prior opportunity to respond. Also, communications may be held with any other offerors whose exclusion from, or inclusion in, the competitive range is uncertain. Such communications shall not be used to cure proposal deficiencies or omissions that alter the technical or cost elements of the proposal, and/or otherwise revise the proposal, but may be considered in rating proposals for the purpose of establishing the competitive range. 2. The Contracting Officer will, in concert with program staff, decide which proposals are in the competitive range. The competitive range will be comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals. Oral or written discussions will be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range. While it is NCI's policy to conduct discussions with all offerors in the competitive range, NCI reserves the right, in special circumstances, to limit the number of proposals included in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition. All aspects of the proposals are subject to discussions, including cost, technical approach, past performance, and contractual terms and conditions. At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror still in the competitive range shall be given an opportunity to submit a written Final Proposal Revision (FPR) with the reservation of the right to conduct finalization of details with the selected source in accordance with HHSAR 315.370. e. The process described in FAR 15.101-1 will be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors and to consider award to other than the lowest price offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror. f. The NCI reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards, or no award at all to the RFP. In addition, the RFP may be amended or canceled as necessary to meet NCI requirements. Synopses of awards exceeding $25,000 will be published in FedBizOpps. 12. Past Performance Information - 52 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 c. Required Education in the Protection of Human Research Participants NIH policy requires education on the protection of human subject participants for all investigators submitting NIH proposals for contracts for research involving human subjects. This policy announcement is found in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts Announcement dated June 5, 2000 at the following website: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/ guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html. Offerors should review the policy announcement prior to submission of their offers. The following is a summary of the Policy Announcement: For any solicitation for research involving human subjects, the offeror shall provide in its technical proposal the following information: (1) a list of the names of the principal investigator and any other individuals proposed under the contract who are responsible for the design and/or conduct of the research; (2) the title of the education program completed (or to be completed prior to the award of the contract) for each named personnel; (3) a one sentence description of the program(s) listed in (2) above. This requirement extends to investigators and all individuals responsible for the design and/or conduct of the research who are working as subcontractors or consultants under the contract. Curricula that are readily available and meet the educational requirement include the NIH Office of Extramural Research (OER) on-line tutorial, entitled "Protecting Human Research Participants" at: http://phrp.nihtraining.com. This course is also available in Spanish under the title "Protección de los participantes humanos de la investigación" at: http:// pphi.nihtraining.com. You may take the tutorials on-line or download the information in PDF form at no cost. The University of Rochester has made its training program available for individual investigators. Completion of this program will also satisfy the educational requirement. The University of Rochester manual can be obtained through Centerwatch, Inc. at http://store.centerwatch.com/p-51-protecting-study-volunteers-in-research-3rdedition.aspx. If an institution already has developed educational programs on the protection of research participants, completion of these programs also will satisfy the educational requirement. In addition, prior to the substitution of the principal investigator or any other individuals responsible for the design and/or conduct of the research under the contract, the Contractor shall provide the contracting officer with the title of the education program and a one sentence description of the program that the replacement has completed. d. Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Research Involving Human Subjects It is NIH policy that women and members of minority groups and their sub-populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research projects involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes to the satisfaction of the relevant Institute/Center Director that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. The Director, NIH, may determine that exclusion under other circumstances is acceptable, upon the recommendation of an Institute/Center Director, based on a compelling rationale and justification. Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources. Women of childbearing potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research. This policy results from the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43), and applies to research subjects of all ages. All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should read the UPDATED "NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in Clinical Research, Amended October 2001," published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts on October 9, 2001 at the following web site: - 59 -

Research conducted with human subjects (or on material of human origin such as tissues, specimens and cognitive phenomena) for which an investigator (or colleague) directly interacts with human subjects. Excluded from this definition are in vitro studies that utilize human tissues that cannot be linked to a living individual. Patient-oriented research includes (a) mechanisms of human disease, (b) therapeutic interventions, (c) clinical trials, and (d) development of new technologies; (2) Epidemiologic and behavioral studies; and (3) Outcomes research and health services research." Information Required for ALL Clinical Research Proposals This solicitation contains a review criterion addressing the adequacy of: (1) the offeror's plans for inclusion of women and minorities in the research proposed; or (2) the offeror's justification(s) for exclusion of one or both groups from the research proposed. Provide information on the composition of the proposed study population in terms of sex/ gender and racial/ethnic groups and provide a rationale for selection of such subjects in response to the requirements of the solicitation. The description may include (but is not limited to) information on the population characteristics of the disease or condition being studied in the planned research, and/or described in the statement of work, national and local demography, knowledge of the racial/ethnic/cultural characteristics of the population, prior experience and collaborations in recruitment and retention of the populations and subpopulations to be studied, and the plans, arrangements and letters of commitment from relevant community groups and organizations for the planned research. The proposal must include the following information: ˇ A description of the subject selection criteria ˇ The proposed dates of enrollment (beginning and end) ˇ A description of the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women and minorities as subjects ˇ A compelling rationale for proposed exclusion of any sex/gender or racial/ethnic group ˇ The proposed sample composition using the "Targeted/Planned Enrollment Table"(see Section J, Attachments) NOTE 1: For all proposals, use the ethnic and racial categories and complete the "Targeted/Planned Enrollment Table in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Directive No. 15, which may be found at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/ fedreg_notice_15. NOTE 2: If this is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) or Requirements contract as defined in FAR 16.5, the proposal should describe in general terms how it will comply with each bulleted item above for each task order. When the Government issues a task order request for proposal, each of the bulleted information items must be fully and specifically addressed in the proposal. Standards for Collecting Data. When you, as a contractor, are planning data collection items on race and ethnicity, you shall use, at a minimum, the categories identified in OMB Directive No. 15. The collection of greater detail is encouraged. However, you should design any additional, more detailed items so that they can be aggregated into these required categories. Self-reporting or self-identification using two separate questions is the preferred method for collecting data on race and ethnicity. When you collect race and - 60 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 ethnicity separately, you must collect ethnicity first. You shall offer respondents the option of selecting one or more racial designations. When you collect data on race and ethnicity separately, you shall also make provisions to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are Hispanic or Latino. When you present aggregate data, you shall provide the number of respondents who selected only one category, for each of the five racial categories. If you collapse data on multiple responses, you shall make available, at a minimum, the total number of respondents reporting "more than one race." Federal agencies shall not present data on detailed categories if doing so would compromise data quality or confidentiality standards. In addition to the above requirements, solicitations for NIH defined Phase III clinical trials * require that: a) all proposals and/or protocols provide a description of plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to detect significant differences in intervention effect (see NIH Guide: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm, Definitions - Significant Difference). *The definition of an " NIH-Defined Phase III clinical trial" can also be found at this website.) by sex/gender, racial/ethnic groups, and relevant subpopulations, if applicable; and b) all contractors to report annually cumulative subject accrual, and progress in conducting analyses for sex/gender and race/ethnicity differences. Offerors may obtain copies of the Updated Guidelines from the sources above or from the contact person listed in the solicitation. Also, the proposal must include one of the following plans: ˇ Plans to conduct valid analysis to detect significant differences in intervention effect among sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support these significant differences among subgroups, OR ˇ Plans to include and analyze sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support no significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups, OR ˇ Plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in sex/gender and/or racial/ ethnic subgroups (without requiring high statistical power for each subgroup) when the prior studies neither support nor negate significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups. Use the form entitled, "Targeted/Planned Enrollment Table," when preparing your response to the solicitation requirements for inclusion of women and minorities. (See Section J-List of Documents, Exhibits and Other Attachments of the RFP) Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, the Government has determined that the work required by this solicitation does not involve a sex/gender specific study or a single or limited number of minority population groups. Therefore, the NIH believes that the inclusion of women and minority populations is appropriate for this project. (See Section M of this RFP for more information about evaluation factors for award.) Use the form entitled, "Inclusion Enrollment Report," for reporting in the resultant contract.

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 e. Inclusion of Children in Research Involving Human Subjects It is NIH policy that children (defined below) must be included in all human subjects research, including, but not limited to, clinical trials, conducted under a contract funded by the NIH, unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to include them. (See examples of Justifications for Exclusion of Children below). For the purposes of this policy, contracts involving human subjects include categories that would otherwise be exempt from the DHHS Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects (sections 101(b) and 401(b) of 45 CFR 46), such as surveys, evaluation of educational interventions, and studies of existing data or specimens that should include children as participants. This policy applies to both domestic and foreign research contracts. For purposes of this policy, a child is defined as an individual under the age of 21 years. All offerors proposing research involving human subjects should read the "NIH Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Children as Participants in Research Involving Human Subjects" which was published in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts on March 6, 1998 and is available at the following URL address: http://www.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-024.html Offerors also may obtain copies from the contact person listed in the RFP. Inclusion of children as participants in research must be in compliance with all applicable subparts of 45 CFR 46 as well as other pertinent laws and regulations whether or not such research is otherwise exempted from 45 CFR 46. Therefore, any proposals must include a description of plans for including children, unless the offeror presents clear and convincing justification for an exclusion. The "Human Subjects" section of your technical proposal should provide either a description of the plans to include children and a rationale for selecting or excluding a specific age range of child, or an explanation of the reason(s) for excluding children as participants in the research. This solicitation contains a review criterion addressing the adequacy of: (1) the plans for including children as appropriate for the scientific goals of the research; and/or (2) the justification of exclusion of children or exclusion of a specific age range of children. When children are included, the plan also must include a description of: (1) the expertise of the investigative team for dealing with children at the ages included; (2) the appropriateness of the available facilities to accommodate the children; and, (3) the inclusion of a sufficient number of children to contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose/objective of the solicitation. Justifications for Exclusion of Children It is expected that children will be included in all research involving human subjects unless one or more of the following exclusionary circumstances can be fully justified: ˇ The objective of the solicitation is not relevant to children.
o

There are laws or regulations barring the inclusion of children in the research to be conducted under the solicitation. The knowledge being sought in the research is already available for children or will be obtained from another ongoing study, and an additional study will be redundant. You should provide documentation of other studies justifying the exclusion. A separate, age-specific study in children is warranted and preferable. Examples include: - The relative rarity of the condition in children, as compared with adults (in that extraordinary effort would be needed to include children); or - 62 -

o

o

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 - The number of children is limited because the majority are already accessed by a nationwide pediatric disease research network; or - Issues of study design preclude direct applicability of hypotheses and/ or interventions to both adults and children (including different cognitive, developmental, or disease stages of different age-related metabolic processes); or - Insufficient data are available in adults to judge potential risk in children (in which case one of the research objectives could be to obtain sufficient adult data to make this judgment). While children usually should not be the initial group to be involved in research studies, in some instances, the nature and seriousness of the illness may warrant their participation earlier based on careful risk and benefit analysis; or - Study designs aimed at collecting additional data on pre-enrolled adult study subjects (e.g., longitudinal follow-up studies that did not include data on children); - Other special cases justified by the offeror and found acceptable to the review group and the Institute Director Definition of a Child For the purpose of this solicitation, a child is defined as an individual under the age of 21 years. The definition of child described above will pertain to this solicitation (notwithstanding the FDA definition of a child as an individual from infancy to 16 years of age, and varying definitions employed by some states). Generally, State laws define what constitutes a "child," and such definitions dictate whether or not a person can legally consent to participate in a research study. However, State laws vary, and many do not address when a child can consent to participate in research. Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46, subpart D, Sec.401-409) address DHHS protections for children who participate in research, and rely on State definitions of "child" for consent purposes. Consequently, the children included in this policy (persons under the age of 21) may differ in the age at which their own consent is required and sufficient to participate in research under State law. For example, some states consider a person age 18 to be an adult and therefore one who can provide consent without parental permission. Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects a. HHS Regulations at 45 CFR Part 46, Subpart C provide additional protections pertaining to biomedical and behavioral research involving prisoners or those individuals who, during the period of the contract become prisoners, as subjects. These regulations also set forth the duties of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) where prisoners are involved in the research. HHS funded research involving prisoners as subjects may not proceed until the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) issues approval, in writing, as required by 45 CFR 46.306(a)(2). In addition, OHRP Guidance on the Involvement of Prisoners in Research may be found at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/prisoner.pdf. b. HHS Waiver for Epidemiological Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects On June 20, 2003 the Secretary of HHS waived the applicability of certain provisions of Subpart C of 45 CFR Part 46, (Additional DHHS Protections Pertaining to Biomedical and

- 63 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 Behavioral Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects) to specific types of epidemiological research involving prisoners as subjects. The applicability of 45 CFR 46.305(a)(1) and 46.306(a)(2) for certain epidemiological research conducted or funded by DHHS is waived when: 1. The sole purposes are: a. to describe the prevalence or incidence of a disease by identifying all cases, or b. to study potential risk factor associations for a disease, and 2. The Institution responsible for the conduct of the research certifies to the OHRP that the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the research and fulfilled its duties under 45 CFR 46.305(a)(2 7) and determined and documented that: a. the research presents no more than minimal risk, and b. no more than inconvenience to the prisoner subjects, and c. prisoners are not a particular focus of the research. For more information about this Waiver see http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/special/ prisoners/Prisoner waiver 6-20-03.pdf f. Research Involving Human Fetal Tissue Human Fetal Tissue means tissue or cells obtained from a dead human fetus, including human embryonic stem cells, human pluripotent stem cells and human embryonic germ cells. The governing federal statute is the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 289g 1 and 289g 2. Implementing regulations and guidance for conducting research on human fetal tissue may be found at 45 CFR 46, Subpart B and http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/ not93-235.html and any subsequent revisions to this NIH Guide to Grants and Contracts ("Guide") Notice. By signing the face page of the proposal, the offeror (authorized institutional official) certifies that researchers using human fetal tissue are in compliance with 42 USC 289g 2. This statute specifically prohibits any person from knowingly acquiring, receiving, or transferring any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration. "Valuable consideration" is a concept similar to profit, and does not include reasonable payment for costs associated with the collection processing, preservation, storage, quality control or transportation of these tissues. Research involving the transplantation of human fetal tissue must be conducted in accordance with applicable Federal, State and local law. g. Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (including Human Gene Transfer Research) Recombinant DNA Molecules are either 1) molecules that are constructed outside of living cells by joining natural or synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate in a living cell, or 2) DNA molecules that result from the replication of those described in 1). All research involving recombinant DNA molecules that is conducted at or sponsored by an entity that receives any support for recombinant DNA research from NIH shall be conducted in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines) (See http://oba.od.nih.gov/rdna/nih_guidelines_oba.html). The NIH Guidelines stipulate biosafety and containment measures for recombinant DNA - 64 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 research and delineate points to consider in the development and conduct of human gene transfer clinical trials, including ethical principles and safety reporting requirements (See Appendix M of the Guidelines). More information about compliance with the NIH Guidelines can be found in a set of Frequently Asked Questions at: http://oba.od.nih.gov/ rdna_ibc/ibc_faq.html. The NIH Guidelines apply to both basic and clinical research studies. Prior to beginning any clinical trials involving the transfer of recombinant DNA to humans, the trial must be registered with the NIH OBA and reviewed by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC). If this contract involves new protocols that contain unique and/or novel issues, the RAC may recommend that the protocol also be discussed by the RAC in a public forum. Approval of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) are necessary before the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and Contracting Officer may approve the protocol prior to the start of the research. The IBC approval may not occur before the NIH RAC has concluded its review of the protocol. Failure to comply with the NIH Guidelines may result in suspension, limitation, or termination of the contract for any work related to recombinant DNA research or a requirement for Contracting Officer prior approval of any or all recombinant DNA projects under this contract. This includes the requirements of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) ( See http://oba.od.nih.gov/rdna_ibc/ibc.html). As specified in Appendix M-1-C-4 of the NIH Guidelines, any serious adverse event that that is both unexpected and associated with the use of the gene transfer product (i.e., there is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the use of the product) must be reported to the NIH OBA and IBC within 15 days, or within 7 days if the event was life-threatening or resulted in a death. A copy of the report must also be filed with the COR and Contracting Officer (See http://oba.od.nih.gov/oba/rac/guidelines_02/ APPENDIX_M.htm). Such reports must also be submitted within their mandated time frames to the IRB, Food and Drug Administration, and, if applicable, the HHS Office for Human Research Protections. h. Human Embryonic Germ Cell (HEGC) Research Guidelines. Research use of human embryonic germ cells derived from fetal tissue with Federal funds requires review of compliance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Using Human Pluripotent Stem Cells ( http://stemcells.nih.gov/policy/guidelines.asp) (only the information regarding human embryonic germ cells is relevant). Embryonic germ cells are pluripotent stem cells derived from human embryos. See NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts Notice NOT OD 02 049, requiring that offerors/contractors submit certain documents to the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG), which will be reviewed in a public meeting. Research using human embryonic germ cells may not be performed prior to approval by the HPSCRG. All offerors should read the "NIH Guidelines" ( http://stemcells.nih.gov/policy/ guidelines.asp) if they either: (1) propose to respond to the Statement of Work requirements by conducting research that uses human embryonic germ cells or, (2) are responding to a Statement of Work that requires the use of human embryonic germ cells. Offerors may obtain copies of these Guidelines from the website above or from the contact person listed in this solicitation.

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 If the offeror intends to fulfill the requirements of the Statement of Work by performing research using human embryonic germ cells, it must so state in its proposal. If the offeror's proposal includes research using human embryonic germ cells and it receives a contract award, the Contractor may not perform any research using these human embryonic germ cells until the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) has reviewed and approved the documentation furnished as prescribed in "Procedures for Submission of Compliance Documents to the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) for the Research Use of Human Embryonic Germ Cells" ( http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-049.html) and the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor of the approval in writing. During the contract, the Contractor shall submit the original and two copies of the required documentation and assurances that address the areas covered in "Procedures for Submission of Compliance Documents to the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Review Group (HPSCRG) for the Research Use of Human Embryonic Germ Cells," at: (http://grants2.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice files/NOT OD 02 049.html) to the Contracting Officer. This documentation will be forwarded for review and approval to the HPSCRG. If the HPSCRG disapproves the documentation presented by the Contractor, the Contracting Officer may elect to either terminate the contract in accordance with the Termination for Convenience clause of the contract OR determine not to exercise subsequent options as appropriate based the terms of the specific contract. Otherwise, when the HPSCRG approves the documentation, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing that research using the human embryonic germ cells may commence. Research involving the use of human embryonic germ cells shall not be conducted under the contract until the HPSCRG review and approval have been obtained, and the Contracting Officer has provided written notice of such approval to the Contractor. i. Human Embryonic Stem Cell (hESC) Research On March 9, 2009, the President issued Executive Order (EO) 13505: Removing Barriers to Responsible Scientific Research Involving Human Stem Cells. The NIH has published Guidelines on Human Stem Cell Research at: http://stemcells.nih.gov/ policy/2009guidelines.htm. The Guidelines implement EO 13505 with regard to extramural NIH-funded stem cell research, establish policy and procedure under which the NIH will fund such research, and help ensure that NIH-funded research in this area is ethically responsible, scientifically worthy, and conducted in accordance with applicable law. Specific eligibility requirements for NIH funding of hESCs are included in Section II, Eligibility of Human Embryonic Stem Cells for Research with NIH Funding. Ineligible sources and uses of hESCs are addressed in Section IV, Research Using hESCs and/or Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells That, Although the Cells May Come from Eligible Sources, is Nevertheless Ineligible for NIH Funding, and Section V, Other Research Not Eligible for NIH Funding. To facilitate research using human embryonic stem cells, the NIH has established a Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry ("the NIH Registry") that lists the human embryonic stem cells that are currently eligible for use in NIH-funded research. This registry is available at: http://stemcells.nih.gov/registry/. Proposed human embryonic stem cell line(s) must be on the NIH Registry at the time of proposal submission. Any possible changes to the proposed cell line must be discussed in the proposal. Offerors wishing to have Human Embryonic Stem Cell Lines added to the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry must submit the request on Form NIH 2890 through the following website: http:// hescregapp.od.nih.gov/NIH_Form_2890_Login.htm.

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 Research involving the derivation of new stem cells from human embryos or the use of human embryonic stem cells that are not listed on the NIH Registry may not be conducted with Federal funding. 5. Obtaining and Disseminating Biomedical Research Resources As a public sponsor of biomedical research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a dual interest in accelerating scientific discovery and facilitating product development. Intellectual property restrictions can stifle the broad dissemination of new discoveries and limit future avenues of research and product development. At the same time, reasonable restrictions on the dissemination of research tools are sometimes necessary to protect legitimate proprietary interests and to preserve incentives for commercial development. To assist NIH contractors achieve an appropriate balance, the NIH has provided guidance in the form of a two-part document, consisting of Principles setting forth the fundamental concepts and Guidelines that provide specific information to patent and license professionals and sponsored research administrators for implementation. The purpose of these Principles and Guidelines is to assist NIH funding recipients in determining: 1) Reasonable terms and conditions for making NIH-funded research resources available to scientists in other institutions in the public and private sectors (disseminating research tools); and 2) Restrictions to accept as a condition of receiving access to research tools for use in NIH-funded research (acquiring research tools). The intent is to help recipients ensure that the conditions they impose and accept on the transfer of research tools will facilitate further biomedical research, consistent with the requirements of the Bayh-Dole Act and NIH funding policy. This policy, entitled, "Sharing Biomedical Research Resources: Principles and Guidelines for Recipients of NIH Research Grants and Contracts," (Federal Register Notice, December 23, 1999 [64 FR 72090] will be included in any contract awarded from this solicitation. It can be found at the following website: http://ott.od.nih.gov/pdfs/64FR72090.pdf a. Sharing Research Data [Note: This policy applies to all NIH contracts, regardless of dollar value, that are expected to generate research data.] The NIH endorses the sharing of final research data to expedite the translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. This contract is expected to generate research data. Therefore, the offeror must submit a plan in its technical proposal for data sharing or state why data sharing is not possible. If data sharing is limited, the offeror should explain such limitations in its data sharing plan. NIH's data sharing policy may be found at the following Web site: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-03-032.html [If the resultant contract is part of a collaborative program involving multiple sites, the data sharing will be governed by a dissemination plan to be developed jointly following award. Offerors must include in their proposals a statement of willingness to work collaboratively after award with the other funded sites to prepare a joint dissemination plan. Coordinating Center proposals should describe methods to coordinate the dissemination planning and implementation. The Coordinating Center must include a budget and justification for any additional costs of this collaborative effort.] 6. Information and Physical Access Security is applicable to this solicitation and the following information is provided to assist in proposal preparation.

Contractor/subcontractor employees assigned to Level 6 positions shall undergo a Suitability Determination and Background Investigation (MBI). [X] Level 5: Public Trust - Moderate Risk. Contractor/subcontractor employees assigned to Level 5 positions with no previous investigation and approval shall undergo a Suitability Determination and a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI), or a Limited Background Investigation (LBI). [X] Level 1: Non-Sensitive. Contractor/subcontractor employees assigned to Level 1 positions shall undergo a Suitability Determination and National Check and Inquiry Investigation (NACI). The personnel investigation procedures for Contractor personnel require that (upon award) the Contractor prepare and submit background check/investigation - 68 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 forms based on the type of investigation required. The minimum Government investigation for a non-sensitive position is a National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) with fingerprinting. More restricted positions - i.e., those above nonsensitive, require more extensive documentation and investigation. As part of its proposal, and if the anticipated position sensitivity levels are specified in paragraph (d) above, the Offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer of (1) its proposed personnel who will be subject to a background check/ investigation and (2) whether any of its proposed personnel who will work under the contract have previously been the subject of national agency checks or background investigations. Upon award, the Contractor shall submit a roster, by name, position, e-mail address, phone number and responsibility, of all staff (including subcontractor staff) working under the contract who will develop, have the ability to access and/ or maintain a Federal Information System(s). The roster shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), with a copy to the Contracting Officer, within 14 calendar days after the effective date of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor of the appropriate level of suitability investigations to be performed. An electronic template, "Roster of Employees Requiring Suitability Investigations," is available for contractor use at: https://ocio.nih.gov/aboutus/publicinfosecurity/acquisition/Documents/ SuitabilityRoster_10-15-12.xlsx . Upon receipt of the Government's notification of applicable Suitability Investigations required, the Contractor shall complete and submit the required forms within 30 days of the notification. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in advance when any new personnel, who are subject to a background check/investigation, will work under the contract and if they have previously been the subject of national agency checks or background investigations. All contractor and subcontractor employees shall comply with the conditions established for their designated position sensitivity level prior to performing any work under this contract. Contractors may begin work after the fingerprint check has been completed. d. Investigations are expensive and may delay performance, regardless of the outcome of the investigation. Delays associated with rejections and consequent reinvestigations may not be excusable in accordance with the FAR clause, Excusable Delays - see FAR 52.249-14. Accordingly, the Contractor shall ensure that any additional employees whose names it submits for work under this contract have a reasonable chance for approval. e. Typically, the Government investigates personnel at no cost to the Contractor. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the additional investigation(s). Accordingly, if position sensitivity levels are specified in paragraph (d) above, the Offeror shall ensure that the employees it proposes for work under this contract/order have a reasonable chance for approval. f. The Contractor shall include language similar to this "HHS Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security" language in all subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have the same frequency and duration of (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system; (3) access to sensitive HHS data/information, whether in an HHS-controlled - 69 -

Mentor-Protégé agreements--joint agreements, approved by HHS' OSDBU, which detail the specific terms, conditions, and responsibilities of the mentor-protégé relationship. (End of provision) 7. HUBZone Small Business Concerns Small Business offerors located in underutilized business zones, called "HUBZones," will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-4, NOTICE OF PRICE EVALUATION PREFERENCE FOR HUBZONE SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS, which is incorporated by reference in ARTICLE I.3. of this solicitation. Qualified HUBZone firms are identified in the Small Business Administration website at http://www.sba.gov/hubzone. 8. Extent of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.304(c)(4), the extent of participation of Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) concerns in performance of the contract in the authorized NAICS Industry Subsectors shall be evaluated in unrestricted competitive acquisitions expected to exceed $650,000 ($1.5 million for construction) subject to certain limitations (see FAR 19.1202-1 and 19.1202-2(b). The dollar amounts cited above include any option years/option quantities that may be included in this solicitation. The definition of a "small disadvantaged business" is cited in FAR 19.001. The factor entitled "Extent of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation" as set forth in Section M Evaluation Factors for Award shall be used for evaluation purposes. The Department of Commerce determines, on an annual basis, by Subsectors, as contained in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, and region, if any, the authorized SDB procurement mechanisms and applicable factors (percentages). The NAICS codes can be found at: http://www.sba.gov/size The Department of Commerce website for the annual determination for NAICS codes* is: http://www.acquisition.gov/References/sdbadjustments.htm. * Note: Public Law 103-355 which authorized the SDB Price Evaluation Adjustment (PEA) and associated percentages/factors expired on December 9, 2004, therefore, the percentages shown at this website are no longer applicable. Offerors shall include with their offers, SDB targets, expressed as dollars and percentages of total contract value, in each of the applicable, authorized NAICS Industry Subsector(s). The applicable authorized NAICS Industry Subsector(s) for this project is (are) identified elsewhere in this RFP. A total target for SDB participation by the Prime Contractor, that includes any joint ventures and team members, shall be provided as well as a total target for SDB participation by subcontractors. In addition, offerors must provide information that describes their plans for meeting the targets set forth in their proposal. This information shall be provided in one clearly marked section of the Business Proposal, which shall describe the extent of participation of SDB concerns in the performance of the contract. If the evaluation factor in this solicitation includes an SDB evaluation factor or subfactor that considers the extent to which SDB concerns are specifically identified, the SDB concerns considered in the evaluation shall be listed in any resultant contract. Offerors should note that addressing the extent of small disadvantaged business participation is not in any way intended to be a substitute for submission of the subcontracting plan, if it is required by this solicitation. An example of the type of information that might be given (in addition to the narrative describing the plan for meeting the targets) follows: EXAMPLE - 84 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 Targets for SDB Participation - NAICS Industry Subsector 223

SDB Percentage of Total Contract Value Total Contract 25% Value- $1,000,000 SDB Participation 10% by Prime (Includes joint venture partners and team arrangements)* SDB Participation 15% by subcontractors $250,000 $100,000

SDB Dollars

$150,000

*Note: FAR Subpart 9.6 defines "Contractor team arrangements" to include two or more companies forming a partnership or joint venture to act as a potential Prime Contractor, or a potential Prime Contractor who agrees with one or more companies to have them act as its subcontractors on a specific contract or acquisition program. For purposes of evaluation of the SDB participation factor, FAR 19.1202-4 requires that SDB joint ventures and teaming arrangements at the prime level be presented separately from SDB participation by subcontractors.

9. Other Administrative Data a. Property 1. It is HHS policy that Contractors will provide all property necessary for contract performance.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
1. GENERAL Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against four factors. The factors in order of importance are: technical, cost, past performance and Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) participation. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, past performance, cost/price and SDB participation are also important to the overall contract award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. However cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more Offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price. The trade-off process described in FAR 15.101-1 may be employed. This process permits tradeoffs among cost/price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to consider award to other then the lowest priced or highest technically rated Offeror. The Government intends to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFP. The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFP. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed factors listed below. 2. COST/PRICE EVALUATION Offeror(s) cost/price proposal will be evaluated for reasonableness. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the government that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market. Normally, price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition, but may also be determined through cost and price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. Cost Realism: The specific elements of each offeror(s) proposed costs are realistic when the proposed cost elements are evaluated and found to: 1) be realistic for the work to be performed; 2) reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and 3) be consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror(s) technical proposal. Cost Realism will be evaluated only on the offeror(s) inputs which the Government will use to determine the most probable cost to perform the contract in a manner consistent with the offeror's proposal. Cost realism analysis will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d). The result of the cost realism analysis will be considered in the making the best value tradeoff decision.

3. HUMAN SUBJECT EVALUATION This research project involves human subjects. NIH Policy requires: a. Protection of Human Subjects from Research Risks The offeror's proposal must address the involvement of human subjects and protections from research risk relating to their participation, or provide sufficient information on the research subjects to allow a determination by NCI that a designated exemption is appropriate. If you claim that this research should be considered exempt from coverage by the Federal Regulations at 45 CFR 46, the proposal should address why you believe it is exempt, and under which exemption it applies. The reviewers will evaluate the proposal with regard to four issues: Risks to Human Subjects, Adequacy of Protection Against Risks, Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects - 91 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 and Others, and Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained. See Section L for a complete discussion of what is required to be addressed for each of these issues. Based on the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., concerns are identified as to the protections described against risk to human subjects or no discussion is found regarding protections against risk to human subjects) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the protection of human subjects from research risks is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. b. Women and Minorities Women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations must be included in the study population of research involving human subjects, unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification are provided indicating that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research. In addition, for NIH-Defined Phase III clinical trials, all proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans to conduct analyses, as appropriate, to detect significant differences in intervention effect (see NIH Guide http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/ women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm , Definitions - Significant Difference) by sex/gender, racial/ethnic groups, and relevant subpopulations, if applicable, unless the Government has specified that this solicitation involves a sex/gender specific study or a single or limited number of minority population groups. The proposal also must include one of the following plans:

ˇ Plans to conduct valid analysis to detect significant differences in intervention effect among sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support these significant differences among subgroups, OR ˇ Plans to include and analyze sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups when prior studies strongly support no significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups (representation of sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic groups as subject selection criterion is not required; however, inclusion and analyses are encouraged), OR ˇ Plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic subgroups (without requiring high statistical power for each subgroup) when the prior studies neither support nor negate significant differences in intervention effect between subgroups. Also, the proposal must address the proposed outreach programs for recruiting women and minorities as participants. Reviewers will consider the areas covered here and in Section L of the solicitation in narrative form in their evaluation. Some of the issues they will evaluate include: ˇ whether the plan proposed includes minorities and both genders in adequate representation ˇ how the offeror addresses the inclusion of women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations in the development of a proposal that is appropriate to the scientific objectives of the solicitation

- 92 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 ˇ the description of the proposed study populations in terms of sex/gender and racial/ethnic groups and the rationale for selection of such subjects ˇ if exclusion is proposed, that the rationale is appropriate with respect to the health of the subjects and/or to the purpose of the research. ˇ In addition, for gender exclusion, the reviewers will examine the rationale to determine if it is because:
o

the purpose of the research constrains the offeror's selection of study participants by gender (e.g., uniquely valuable stored specimens or existing datasets are single gender; very small numbers of subjects are involved; or overriding factors dictate selection of subjects); or gender representation of specimens or existing datasets cannot be accurately determined, and this does not compromise the scientific objectives of the research.

o o

ˇ For minority group exclusion, the reviewers will examine the rationale to determine if those minority groups are excluded because:
o o

inclusion of those groups would be inappropriate with respect to their health; or inclusion of those groups would be inappropriate with respect to the purpose of the research.

ˇ For NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials, reviewers will also consider whether there is an adequate description of plans to conduct analyses to detect significant differences of clinical or public health importance in intervention effect(s) by sex/gender and/or racial ethnic subgroups when the intervention effect(s) is expected in the primary analyses, or if there is an adequate description of plans to conduct valid analyses of the intervention effect in subgroups when the intervention effect(s) is not expected in the primary analyses. If you determine that inclusion of women and minority populations is not feasible, you must submit a detailed rationale and justification for exclusion of one or both groups from the study population with the technical proposal. The Government will review the rationale to determine if it is appropriate with respect to the health of the subjects and/or the purpose of the research Based on the evaluation of the response to this criterion, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., no discussion can be found regarding the proposed gender/minority inclusion plans, or concerns are identified as to the gender or minority representation, or the proposal does not adequately address limited representation of one gender or minority; or the plan is not in accordance with NIH policy guidelines) or "acceptable." See Section L of the solicitation for the requirements of women/minorities inclusion. If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the inclusion/ exclusion of women and minorities is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. c. Children Children (i.e. individuals under the age of 21) must be included in all human subject research unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to include them.

- 93 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 Your proposal must include a description of plans for including children. If you plan to exclude children from the required research, your proposal must present an acceptable justification for the exclusion. If you determine that exclusion of a specific age range of child is appropriate, your proposal must also address the rationale for such exclusion. Also, the plan must include a description of the expertise of the investigative team for dealing with children at the ages included, of the appropriateness of the available facilities to accommodate the children, and the inclusion of a sufficient number of children to contribute to a meaningful analysis relative to the purpose/objective of the solicitation. Also, see Section L of the solicitation for further specific requirements on inclusion of children. Based on the reviewers' evaluation of the offeror's response, this section of the proposal may be rated "unacceptable" (i.e., no discussion can be found regarding the proposed inclusion plans for children; or concerns are identified as to the offeror's response regarding the inclusion of children; or the plan is not in accordance wit h NIH policy guidelines) or "acceptable." If the reviewers find that this portion of the proposal is "unacceptable" they will provide a narrative supporting their finding. If the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. You will be able to further discuss and/or clarify your position until submission of your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). Once discussions are closed with the submission of your FPR, if your proposed plan for the inclusion of children is still found to be unacceptable, then your proposal may not be considered further for award. 4. EVALUATION OF OPTIONS It is anticipated that any contract awarded from this solicitation will contain option provisions and periods. In accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options, (July 1990), the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement, except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options. 5.

6. EVALUATION OF ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY - SECTION 508 The offeror's proposal must demonstrate compliance with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194 for all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used under this contract/order, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports. If your proposal does not include a completed HHS "Section 508 Product Assessment Template" (hereafter referred to as the "Template") which demonstrates that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, or, if the completed "Template" included in your proposal is considered "noncompliant," and the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range (for competitive proposals), or if the Government holds discussions with the selected source (for sole source acquisitions), you will be afforded the opportunity to further discuss, clarify or modify the "Template" during discussions and in your Final Proposal Revision (FPR). If your "Template" is still considered "noncompliant" by the Government after discussions, your proposal may not be considered further for award. 7. PAST PERFORMANCE FACTOR Offerors' past performance information will be evaluated prior to establishment of the competitive range. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable.

- 98 -

RFP Number : N02CP31007-72 The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. 8. EXTENT OF SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION SDB participation will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall commitment and realism of the offeror's SDB Participation targets will be used in determining the relative merits of the offeror's proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered to offer the best value to the Government. The extent of the offeror's Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Targets will be evaluated before determination of the competitive range. Evaluation of SDB participation will be assessed based on consideration of the information presented in the offeror's proposal. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has demonstrated a commitment to use SDB concerns for the work that it intends to perform. Offers will be evaluated on the following sub-factors: a. Extent to which SDB concerns are specifically identified b. Extent of commitment to use SDB concerns c. Complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform d. Realism of the proposal e. Past performance of offerors in complying with subcontracting plan goals for SDB concerns and monetary targets for SDB participation f. Extent of participation of SDB concerns in terms of the value of the total acquisition. 9. EVALUATION OF SUSTAINABLE ACQUISITION PLAN The Offeror's proposal must demonstrate compliance with FAR 23.1, "Sustainable Acquisition Policy" and the interim rule entitled "Sustainable Acquisition" at: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-31/ pdf/2011-12851.pdf (FAR case 2010-001, FAC 2005-52). The Sustainable Acquisition Plan shall address the environmental products and services to be utilized under the resulting contract, or if the Plan is considered to be "poor" and the Government includes your proposal in the competitive range, the Offeror will be afforded

Attachment 3: Background Statement/Project Objectives A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Studies within the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch importantly focus on sex differences in cancer etiology and address risk factors for some of the most prevalent gender-specific cancers of men (prostate, testis) and women (breast, endometrium, ovarian, cervix). In addition, efforts are being made to clarify the etiology of a number of rare cancers (e.g., liver cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, male breast cancer). DCEG examines an array of exposures, including hormones (both exogenous and endogenous), reproductive factors, medical history, alcohol intake, smoking, anthropometry, physical activity, genes, and viruses [(e.g., human papillomaviruses (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV)]. Specific interests involve measurements of viral markers, endogenous hormones, genetic alterations, and immunologic perturbations. DCEG also studies precursors for breast, ovarian, endometrial, cervical and prostate cancers. DCEG has also examined the effects on cancer risk of early life events, including both pre- and peri-natal exposures. The philosophical focus of HREB studies is to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that relate to carefully defined exposure assessments to specific outcomes to provide new insights into cancer etiology, hormonal carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. This contract has provided the infrastructure for such interdisciplinary work in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Given that many of the biomarkers that DCEG investigates are novel and rigorous methodology for assessment are lacking, DCEG often conducts intensive pilot work prior to initiating full-scale efforts. These efforts require detailed logistical planning in order to expeditiously derive results. Molecular approaches play a critical and increasingly important role in HREB studies. This support services contract has provided essential support to studies that have identified specific molecular steps in the process of human carcinogenesis and have helped HREB to understand the genetic underpinnings of individual susceptibility to various environmental factors. Over the past five years, the use of biomarkers in HREB has grown to include state-of-the-art genomic profiling to identify genetic susceptibility factors and tissue markers, assays for hormones and inflammatory markers, proteomic technologies and other cutting edge methods. It is projected that growth in the applications of complex, new technologies will continue to expand over the next five years. This support services contract has been used to arrange for the collection, handling, transport, storage, analysis, and/or information processing of biologic specimens, as well as to provide general support to studies that have biologic components being carried out through other mechanisms. The current contract has provided support to the molecular components of a number of case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies. Contract support for pilot and feasibility efforts to assess capabilities for launching multidisciplinary studies will continue to be necessary for HREB and DCEG-wide epidemiologic studies where potentially important exposures are being examined. Development of precise methods of defining exposures is necessary, not only to identify new causes of cancer, but also to adequately characterize the shape of the exposure-response relationship. In addition, the advent of genome-wide scans has laid the foundation for understanding the interaction of genetic and environmental factors related to cancer risk. Thus, the future support services Contractor will need to provide staff with superb logistical skills, knowledge of diverse biological specimens and appreciation of specimen collection and handling requirements in order to enable technologically sophisticated assay development and performance.

Key Studies Supported Under the Current Support Services Contract The HREB support services contract provides a range of support activities to Branch investigators, including field work (such as assisting HREB in the development of protocols, questionnaires and other documents for studies, interviewer and abstractor training, subject selection, field supervision, interviewing and abstracting and related approvals that need to be sought), assisting HREB with data processing and analysis, coding expertise in analytic programs, including SAS, STATA, and R, international study management expertise, tracing and follow-up of study participants, expertise in biological specimens (from time of sample acquisition through to long-term storage), and subcontracting for special services. The support services provided under this contract support HREB's efforts on feasibility projects, pilot studies, methodological studies, specialized tasks in large-scale studies, and full support for large-scale cross-sectional, case-control and cohort investigations. The scientific design of studies and supervision of ongoing activities have been the responsibility of HREB scientific staff. Requirements relating to biologic and environmental samples have not included laboratory analysis of samples. Twenty-eight studies received substantial support under the current support services contract. Table 1 lists these studies and shows the specific tasks that were performed with assistance from the support services contract. Eight studies will continue to receive support under the new contract; these are noted with asterisks (**) in Table 1. The major studies are summarized below, beginning with those that have largely been completed and will require minimal additional support under the new support services contract. Some of these studies were largely supported by the contract and others received support only for specific tasks. There are tentative plans to initiate five new studies during the first two years of the new support services contract. Previously Supported Studies that will Require Minimal Additional Support Under the New Support Services Contract 1. Anal Cancer Screening Study: The Anal Cancer Screening study was established to evaluate biomarkers for anal precancers in HIV-infected men who have sex with men. The study was conducted in collaboration with the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) HIV clinic. A total of 363 men were enrolled in the study between 2009 and 2010. The study was terminated before the enrollment goal of 1,000 men could be reached because the study nurse left the HIV clinic and an adequate replacement with experience in anal sampling and high resolution anoscopy (HRA) could not be found in a reasonable time. All men enrolled in the study had two anal cytology samples taken, followed by evaluation with high resolution anoscopy and biopsies of suspicious lesions. The support services contract was used to support the field effort in collaboration with KPNC. 2. Anogenital Cancer Case-Control Studies: In this effort, DCEG is conducting HPV serology measurements in various case-control studies of HPV-related cancers. Approximately 507 plasma samples collected under NCI Protocol #92-C-006 entitled "Cervical cancer (adenocarcinoma) multi-center study in the U.S." and 4190 de-identified serum samples collected from the following studies: 1) Latin American Cervical Cancer Case-Control Study (n=2,681), 2) U.S. Cervical Cancer Case-Control Study (n = 1,002), 3) Rare Reproductive Tumor Study (n = 294) and 4) Case Control Investigations of Penile Cancer in Hunan Province, China (n = 213) are included in the effort. DCEG is currently awaiting measurement of HPV serology that is being

N02CP31007-72

Attachment 3 - Background Statement Page 2 of 14

conducted at the German Cancer Research Center. The results will be available in the fall of 2012 and need to be integrated into the existing database through the support services contract. Analyses of risk of anogenital cancer related to HPV serology will then be conducted. 3. Benign Reproductive Tissue Evaluation Study: The Benign Reproductive Tissue Evaluation Study was established to collect normal endometrial and ovarian tissue from women undergoing gynecologic surgery for non-malignant diseases. The objective of the study was to evaluate the relationship of endometrial and ovarian cancer risk factors with molecular changes in the tissue. The main study goals were: 1) to assess the impact of risk factors on normal endometrial and ovarian tissues and 2) to provide a well annotated source of tissues to assess the specificity of candidate tumor biomarkers. The study was conducted in collaboration with studies from Magee Women's Hospital at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Enrollment started in 2006 and the field effort is anticipated to be completed in the summer of 2012. A total of 150 women were enrolled. Biospecimens collected in the study included urine, blood, frozen endometrial tissue, frozen ovarian tissue, and paraffin-embedded blocks from the endometrial and ovarian specimens. The support services contract was used to support developing a questionnaire and forms for specimen collection, to manage and store specimens, and to support the field effort in collaboration with Magee Women's Hospital. 4. Biliary Tract Cancer Case-Control Study in Shanghai: This multidisciplinary study was established to help clarify the etiology of biliary tract cancers and to gain insight into reasons for the rapid increase in incidence in Shanghai. The study recruited 627 persons with biliary tract cancers, 1,037 persons with gallstones and 959 controls from 1997 through 2000. Participants provided personal interviews and body size measurements. Blood, gallstones, urine and tissue were collected when possible. A majority of controls had abdominal ultrasounds. The support services contract was used for reviewing the inventory of biologic samples, overseeing selection and transport of biological samples, documenting condition of samples, receiving assay results, summarizing quality control results, creating variables and analysis files, and performing data analyses. 5. BREAST Stamp Project: The Breast Radiology Evaluation and Study of Tissues (BREAST) Stamp Project is aimed at assessing the molecular pathologic underpinnings of mammographic density, the strongest known risk factor apart from age for non-familial breast cancer in women. Participants undergoing an image-guided breast biopsy for clinical care (n=465) were enrolled from 2007-2010 at the University of Vermont (UVM), an NCI Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) site. Participants provided risk factor data and donated blood, oral rinses and tissues. Participants have agreed to 10 years of follow-up, which will allow studies of changes in mammographic density, about which little is known. The support services contract was used to aid in the formatting of data collection forms (questionnaires, blood and saliva collection forms) and specimen processing manuals. The support services contract also developed a labeling schema for biospecimens and related shipping protocols and ordered supplies required for biospecimen collection. 6. Chile Biliary Cancer Study: The Chile Biliary Cancer Study was designed as a large population-based multidisciplinary epidemiologic study to help clarify why Chile has such high rates of gallbladder cancer, reaching 38 per 100,000 in the southern part of Chile, which is about 10 times higher than that reported in the U.S. With an aim of accruing 4,000 cases, the study was aimed to comprehensively evaluate some novel risk factors and to examine gene-environment interactions. The support services contract was involved in modifying documents (manuals and forms) from the Biliary Cancer Case-Control Study in Shanghai for use in Chile.

7. Columbia, Missouri Follow-up Study: The Columbia, Missouri Serum Bank, established to identify serum markers for breast cancer, collected samples between 1977 and 1987 from nearly 7,000 cancer-free women. This collection has enabled assessment of various markers, mainly hormones, in relation to a number of subsequent cancers. The latest follow-up of these women was conducted during the previous support services contract, but the current contract has been used to define additional parameters needed for analyses, including assessment of hormone receptor status in breast cancers. 8. Consortial Studies of Endometrial Cancer: Individual cancer epidemiology studies face challenges due to relatively low statistical power, particularly for the study of interactions, narrow range of exposures for several risk factors, and homogeneous ethnic background. The International Collaboration of Endometrial Cancer Research aims to pool data on hormonal, reproductive and other relevant factors from epidemiological studies of endometrial cancer. Similarly, the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium (E2C2) is also an international consortium established to pool resources and data from many studies in an effort to identify both environmental and genetic risk factors for endometrial cancer. The support services contract harmonized data from the U.S. and Polish endometrial cancer case-control studies in accordance with the data dictionary provided by each of these consortia and answered questions from the consortia regarding the datasets. 9. Copenhagen School Health Records Register Study: The Copenhagen School Health Records Register (SHR) Study is an electronic register of health examination information on 372,636 children who attended school in Copenhagen, Denmark from 1936 to 2005. The register contains serial measurements of height and weight, as well as birth weight from 1942 onwards. These data have been linked to various national registers, including the Danish Cancer Registry. The support services contract was instrumental in negotiating the transmittal of data from Copenhagen to HREB. This unique resource will permit us to examine the associations of childhood growth with development of testicular and prostate cancers and esophageal adenocarcinomas. Although increases in testicular cancer risk have been linked with adult height, low birth weight and birth length have also been associated with increased risk, suggesting that attention should focus on the role of growth patterns and such phenomena as catch-up growth. For prostate cancer, adult height has also been used as a proxy of unknown pre-adulthood exposures. Adult height has also been found to be associated with prostate cancer, but the biologic basis for the relationship is unclear. The longitudinal and repeated measures data available in the SHRS may enable some light to be shed on the association. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased more than 650% in the last 35 years in the United States. Much of this increase may be attributable to increases in body mass, but whether obesity in adulthood or childhood is most important is not clear. 10. Endometrial Hyperplasia Study: The endometrial hyperplasia study was designed in 2001 as a retrospective cohort analysis to assess the risk and rate of progression of endometrial cancer precursors to cancer. The study enrolled participants through 2003. This study remains the only completed epidemiological study of this question. The project included collection of medical record data, microscopic slides and tumor blocks from women diagnosed with putative endometrial cancer precursors that progressed to endometrial cancer and a matched set of precursors that did not progress to cancer over a 34-year period at Kaiser Permanente Northwest in Portland, OR. Slides were used for a detailed pathology panel review to confirm and re-classify precursor lesions and resulting cancers. Tumor blocks were used to provide formalin-fixed tissue cores for preparation of tissue microarrays and to extract DNA for molecular analysis to assess biomarkers of etiological heterogeneity and progression. During the latest contract period, the support services contract has been used to support

N02CP31007-72

Attachment 3 - Background Statement Page 4 of 14

access to study data, including the fixed tissue resources which are currently used for biomarker studies. A proposal to update the progression study to the recent time period has been discussed. 11. Follow-up Study of Women Evaluated and Treated for Infertility: Increasing numbers of women are seeking advice for infertility and are being treated with a variety of medications to stimulate ovulation. This is of concern given that increased numbers of ovulatory cycles have been linked to higher risks of ovarian and breast cancers. In addition, the drugs that are used in the treatment of infertility, clomiphene citrate and a variety of gonadotropins, have been shown to increase endogenous estrogens levels, further intensifying interest in their effects on hormonallyrelated cancers. DCEG previously assembled a cohort of 12,193 women evaluated for infertility treatment during the years 1965-1988 at five U.S. clinical sites. Medical records of these women were carefully abstracted for causes of infertility and treatment details, and the women followed by questionnaires and linkage to cancer and death registries. A previous follow-up, through 1999, demonstrated increased cancer risks related to certain causes of infertility (e.g., endometriosis to ovarian cancer, anovulation to uterine cancer), but failed to show substantial increased risks related to use of fertility drugs to either ovarian or breast cancers. There was a suggestion of an increased risk of uterine cancer linked with use of clomiphene, of interest given that this drug is structurally related to tamoxifen, a drug extensively associated with these cancers. The power of the previous follow-up was limited given the relatively young age of the study subjects. Therefore, in 2009, DCEG initiated an updated follow-up of these women. The support services contract was used to trace current location information for the women, develop and administer a questionnaire, validate self-reported cancers against medical records, link identifiers of study subjects against 13 cancer registries in the states in which the women were largely known to reside to identify newly developed cancers, and conduct linkage with the National Death Index to identify occurrences and causes of death. Data files have been assembled to enable analyses of these updated data, which should provide considerably increased power to evaluate cancer risks in relation to both causes of infertility and treatment parameters. 12. Genetics of Mammographic Appearances and Patterns (GenMap) Pilot Study: The GenMapPilot Study took advantage of the infrastructure established through the BREAST Stamp project to collect saliva specimens for DNA to identify determinants of mammographic volumetric density. The support services contract was used to develop a questionnaire, create the subject and biological tracking system, and mail materials along with Oragene saliva kits for the study. Two hundred women were invited to participate by mail. Of these women, 195 women were successfully contacted and106 women were enrolled. DNA of high-quality has been obtained from 100 of these women and these participants are being included in DCEG's genetic studies of normal breast tissue measures. 13. International Collaboration of Cervical Cancer Studies: DCEG participated in a large international consortial effort of Epidemiological Studies of Cervical Cancer, contributing cervical cancer cases and controls from the U.S. Case-Control study, the Kaiser Portland Study, the Guanacaste Natural History Study, and the Adenocarcinoma Case-Control Study. The support services contract assisted in developing datasets with variables coded according to guidelines provided by the organizer of this consortial effort. 14. Intramural to India Cervical Cancer Project: The `Intramural to India' initiative is funded through the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) as part of a US-India Joint Working Group on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS Studies. The clinical performance of two novel biomarker assays (p16 and HPV E6/E7 mRNA) is being evaluated in a cohort of 1,000 HIVinfected women in India against a reference standard of histologically-confirmed cervical

intraepithelial neoplasia, grade 2/3 or higher (>CIN2 and >CIN3). The Linear Array HPV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay will measure carcinogenic HPV-DNA for comparison purposes. This study will allow evaluation of the field adoption and efficacy of these newer assays, permit validation of collection, transport, storage, and evaluation protocols, and serve as a resource for studies on HIV-HPV co-infection. The support services contract was used for supporting field efforts and facilitating laboratory assays for the study. This included field-based installation (at the National AIDS Research Institute in Pune, India) of the HPV Linear Array HPV PCR assay kits from the manufacturer (Roche, Inc.). Given the complexities of procuring the kits in a timely manner and setting them up for a study in India, the support services contract's coordination allowed the selection of the most competitively priced option via the manufacturer's Asia subsidiary. This ensured efficient shipment and customs clearance for the kits, as well as a staggered delivery schedule to coincide with the study start-up and participant recruitment schedule. 15. JANUS-Testicular Germ Cell Tumor (TGCT) Study: It has been suggested that men who develop TGCT are born with malfunctioning Leydig cells in their testes. As a result, their steroid hormone levels may vary from the levels in men who have normally functioning Leydig cells and do not develop TGCT. To examine this hypothesis, DCEG is conducting a study using serum from the JANUS Serum Bank. The JANUS Serum Bank is a population based bank of serum samples from 317,000 persons in Norway. The serum donors either participated in health studies in various parts of Norway or were blood donors from the Oslo area. The specimens were collected during the period 1972-2004. Since donating a sample, 249 men developed TGCT and are serving as the case group for the study. Men who did not develop TGCT were matched 2:1 on age at donation, date of donation and region of Norway to serve as the control group. Covariate information on the cases and controls is being obtained via linkage to 6 populationbased registers in Norway. All serum samples will be analyzed for testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androsterone, androstenedione, androstanediol, and -diol-diol-3G, androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G). dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), The support services contract was instrumental in negotiating approvals for transmittal of data and samples from Norway to the U.S., which hopefully will be delivered within the next several months. They will continue to assist in formulating datasets amenable to analyses. 16. Kaiser Permanente Liver Cancer Multiphasic Health Checkup Study: Primary liver cancer incidence rates have been increasing in the U.S. since the early 1980's. Reasons for the increase are not entirely clear. DCEG therefore conducted a nested case-control study of primary liver cancer among individuals enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Multiphasic Check-up (MHC) Study. The MHC cohort was enrolled in the late 1960s-early 1970's. At enrollment, all participants completed a baseline questionnaire and some participants donated a blood sample. By 2010, approximately 470 cases of liver cancer had developed in the MHC. Of these cases, approximately half (n=260) had a stored serum available for analysis. In collaboration with investigators at Kaiser, DCEG obtained the stored samples from the cases and matched them 2:1 to non-cases. These samples are being examined for HBV and HCV status and for steroid hormone levels. For all of the liver cancer cases, controls were matched 10:1 to conduct analyses of baseline questionnaire data. Using the questionnaire data, DCEG is examining the association between liver cancer and the following factors: obesity, diabetes, smoking, alcohol intake, height, weight, physical activity, blood pressure, hypertension, serum cholesterol, serum iron indices, and complete blood count. The support services contract was instrumental in negotiating the transmittal of data and samples from KPNC to HREB.

17. Mississippi Delta Cervical Cancer Self-Sampling Demonstration Project: Cytology screening programs have effectively reduced cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S., but programs requiring repeated clinician-administered Pap smears do not adequately cover medically-underserved populations. Self-collection with carcinogenic HPV DNA testing might permit wider screening coverage among women underserved by cytology-based testing. Women living in the Mississippi Delta region are just such an underserved population. The Mississippi Delta Project, conducted between 2007 and 2009, assessed the technical feasibility of cervical cancer screening based on sample self-collection and HPV DNA testing of cervicovaginal specimens from women aged 26 years of age. The support services contract assisted with recruitment of study participants, tracking study participants for follow-up visits and disbursement of incentives, management of study supply materials, monitoring/entering specimen tracking information and testing results, and reviewing data entry and coding. 18. PaP Natural History Study: The Persistence and Progression (PaP) Natural History Study was conducted to evaluate predictors of risk of cervical pre-cancer among HPV-infected women. The study was conducted in collaboration with studiesers at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Over 45,000 women from a general screening population undergoing co-testing for Pap cytology and carcinogenic HPV DNA were enrolled in the study. Residual cervical cytology specimens were collected and stored at the NCI repository. Annual follow-up of HPV-positive women is still ongoing, and additional biospecimens from follow-up visits are collected. The support services contract supported the field effort through several collaborations. 19. Prostate Cancer Case-Control Study in Shanghai, China: This study is a case-control study of 238 incident prostate cancer cases diagnosed in Shanghai, China during 1993-1995, compared with 471 healthy control subjects selected from the Shanghai Resident Registry and frequency matched on age. In person interviews were used to obtain demographic information as well as exposure histories. The support services contract has supported this study in terms of data and biospecimen management, enabling the undertaking of several analyses and publications describing the etiopathogenesis of this disease in a Chinese population. 20. Servicemen's Testicular Environmental and Endocrine Determinants Study Quality of Life (QoL) Study: The Servicemen's Testicular Environmental and Endocrine Determinants (STEED) Study was conducted between 2002 and 2005. The study enrolled approximately 700 military servicemen who developed testicular cancer while serving in the military and approximately 950 servicemen who did not develop testicular cancer. In 2008, DCEG initiated a follow-up study in the STEED population to determine Quality of Life (QoL) among participants. The STEED QoL study recontacted the original participants between 2008 and 2010 to determine whether men with a past diagnosis of testicular cancer reported a poorer QoL than men who had no past history. DCEG also collected additional risk factor information concerning smoking habits and digit length. The support services contract assisted in re-contacting participants and in mailing questionnaires and consent forms. Currently Supported Studies That Will Continue Under the New Support Services Contract 1. Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC): The Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) is a forum of investigators interested in the inherited risk of breast cancer. Many groups are conducting studies with the aim of identifying genes related to the risk of developing breast cancer. The aim of BCAC is to combine data from many studies, and to provide a reliable assessment of the risks associated with these genes. DCEG is leading the addition of e-cadherin expression for over 6,000 breast cancer cases, for which the support services contract will help coordinate maps of tissue

N02CP31007-72

Attachment 3 - Background Statement Page 7 of 14

microarrays from the various studies. These data will eventually be linked to a database for image analysis of the e-cadherin immunohistochemical data. 2. Breast, Ovarian and Endometrial Cancer Case-Control Study in Poland: The Polish breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer study is a complex molecular epidemiologic study conducted in two major cities in Poland (Warsaw and Ló) that was supported by a studies contract with investigators at the Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, Cancer Center and M. Sklodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology (Warsaw, Poland) and Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine (Ló, Poland). Under a separate contract, DCEG previously obtained 7 year follow-up data and clinical treatment data for 227 breast cancer cases with comprehensive genome-wide molecular profiling data (mRNA expression, methylation, germline and tumor mutation/single nucleotide polymorphism data). These analyses have shown some molecular markers to have a significant association with survival independent of treatment and known clinically important prognostic factors (grade, node status, size). Accordingly, the study enrolled 2,386 breast and 347 ovarian cancer cases and 2,798 controls. The support services contract is currently being used to obtain 10 year follow-up information from medical records and mortality information from breast and ovarian cancer cases in the study using the database of the Death Certificate Office of Poland to determine if the previously known and emerging molecular markers have prognostic importance. This effort will extend for a minimum of 12 months. DCEG is collaborating with the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium on studies of ovarian cancer risk and survival related to genetic and epidemiologic risk factors. The 10-year follow-up information will be important for GWAS survival studies in OCAC. These data will enable us to relate genetic, non-genetic and molecular pathological characteristics to long-term cancer outcomes. 3. Ghana Breast Cancer Study: Although breast cancer is becoming a more common disease in Africa, with a high proportion of cases developing among women under age 35 years, little is known regarding its etiology. DCEG has initiated efforts to launch a multidisciplinary casecontrol study in two teaching hospitals in the cities of Accra and Kumasi that treat the majority of breast cancers in Ghana. Data from the 2010 Ghanaian Census will be used to select population controls for the study. Although the goal of this study will be to recruit approximately 1,500 cases for study, prior to initiation of the effort there will be an intensive one year pilot phase where the feasibility of planned study activities will be assessed. A detailed questionnaire will be administered in hospital, and subjects will be asked to donate blood, saliva and fecal samples for assessment of genetic and other biologic markers. Tumor tissue samples will also be sought from cases in order to classify them into subtypes (including triple negative tumors, which predominate among young African women). The support services contract is assisting in developing study materials (abstract form, questionnaires, anthropometric measurement recording forms, manuals, procedures maintaining quality control, data management systems) and interacting with personnel in Ghana to assure success of the study. If the pilot is successful, the full-scale study will be launched, most likely early in 2014, and proceed to ascertain cases for an additional two to three years. 4. Ghana Prostate Cancer Study: The Ghana Prostate Cancer Study is a case-control study of prostate cancer based in Accra, Ghana. This study has three distinct elements, each with recruitment of prostate cancer cases and/or controls. The first element is the population-based component which recruited 1,037 men based on a probability sample of men 50-74 years of age identified using the 2000 census. Seventy-three of these men were found to have prostate cancer. The second element is the retrospective case component with information on 500 prostate cancer cases abstracted from medical records and tissue slides acquired from pathology. The third element is the prospective case recruitment, which is ongoing and has recruited 671 prostate

N02CP31007-72

Attachment 3 - Background Statement Page 8 of 14

cancer patients to date, all of whom have filled out an extensive questionnaire, provided blood samples, and provided biopsy specimens. The support services contract has been used in all aspects of this study, including help with development of field materials, logistical support of specimens from collection to long-term storage, data quality support and management. Ongoing work requires the support services contract to be able to continue to provide these services, especially with regard to the ongoing prospective element which will recruit up to an additional 242 cases. Study management expertise will be essential to ensure a top-quality data set is assembled for subsequent analyses. Case recruitment will cease in June 2012, so priorities for 2013 onwards will be to ensure data quality, providing reports on such, and managing problems in the data pipeline to resolve queries. 5. Gynecologic Oncology Group Questionnaire: The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) is a major clinical trials group aimed at launching trials related to the prevention and treatment of all types of gynecologic cancers. As part of these trials, extensive clinical and pathologic data are collected for the enrolled patients. These data often include ancillary collection of biologic data (blood, tissue samples) that can be used for specialized etiologic and prognostic studies. However, collection of information concerning patient characteristics, including risk factor data, has been limited. Thus, in 2002, DCEG was asked to develop a questionnaire to be administered to study subjects. DCEG developed a detailed, self-administered questionnaire, focused on ovarian and endometrial cancer risk factors, which could be scanned into computer readable files. As a prototype effort, this instrument began to be administered to all patients entering GOG-210, a large molecular staging trial of endometrial cancer. The support services contract was used to help develop this questionnaire and to pre-test it for patient understandability and acceptability. For the last several years, questionnaires have been sought from all patients admitted to the GOG210 trial. Questionnaires are submitted periodically to the support services contract from the GOG Statistical Office, where they are received from the 39 participating centers. Once received, they are scanned and checked for readability, completeness and errors. Computer files are constructed and assistance has been provided in checking for data outliers and developing derived variables for statistical analyses, which are undertaken in house at NCI. Although GOG-210 is anticipated to soon end, efforts are currently underway at NCI to access tissues from enrolled patients for the creation of tumor tissue microarrays. It is anticipated that the support services contract will provide support for identifying and accessing relevant tissues and linking data to questionnaire data. 6. Prostate Tissue Study: The primary objective of the Prostate Tissue Study (PTS) is to quantitate and compare biomarkers, specifically sex steroid hormones, in prostate tissue and serum samples from the same individuals. Secondary objectives include assessment of factors affecting serumtissue correlations; racial differences in tissue hormone levels; genetic effects on serologic and tissue levels; and racial differences in 5-alpha reductase activity. Between 6 and 12 fresh frozen pieces of prostate tissue, fixed prostate tissue, and an overnight-fasting blood draw were obtained from 650 patients. These patients were composed of four ethnic groups undergoing radical prostatectomy, cystoprostatectomy, or transurethral resection of the prostate due to diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder cancer, or localized prostate cancer. Collaborating institutions included George Washington University Medical Center (GWU), INOVA Fairfax Hospital (FFX), University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), University of Oklahoma (OUHSC), and the Shanghai Cancer Institute (SCI). Doctor's Community Hospital (DCH) and Washington Hospital Center (WHC) also participated in the study. Surgeries at DCH and WHC were coordinated by the staff at GWU. The support services contract supported this work by acting as the coordinating center for the study, developing standardized data and specimen collection forms and procedures for the study, supporting the data and specimen collection effort

N02CP31007-72

Attachment 3 - Background Statement Page 9 of 14

and processing the data. Recruitment is now finished but the support services contract will continue to be used to store and manage the data, produce reports and develop analytic files based on collected data. The Prostate Tissue Study is uniquely positioned to answers questions related to carcinogenic effects mediated by sex steroid hormones and other signaling molecules, particularly those involved in paracrine communication. The availability of multiple prostate tissue specimens as well as blood enables comparisons of serologic biomarkers with intraprostatic biomarkers, thus providing the basis for intracellular validation of circulating biomarkers to bolster mechanistic hypotheses, or vice versa to help validate biomarkers with diagnostic and/or prognostic value. In the future the support services contract will be used to manage and process biospecimens (location, amount, retrieval, logistics, aliquoting, extraction, etc.) and data (housing, quality control, coding, analysis,etc.) for ongoing dry and molecular analyses of these data. 7. Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants/Biopsy Study: The Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED) was developed to evaluate determinants of progression from HPV infection to invasive cancer in a large cross-sectional population of women referred to the University of Oklahoma dysplasia clinic. The study included extensive sampling of biospecimens, including cervical cytology, biopsy specimens, blood, cervical secretions, and frozen tissue specimens obtained during treatment of cervical precancer and cancer. The Biopsy Study was developed to study colposcopy and biopsy procedures in women referred to the University of Oklahoma colposcopy clinic for abnormal cervical cancer screening results. The study included sampling of cytology and biopsy specimens, and documentation of the colposcopy impression using high resolution digital photography. Enrollment into both study components was completed in the summer of 2011. Over 2,500 women were enrolled into SUCCEED, and 690 women were enrolled into the Biopsy Study. The support services contract was used to complete enrollment of the last 50 women into the Biopsy Study and to conduct follow-up of women enrolled both in the SUCCEED and the Biopsy Study components. Follow-up disease ascertainment focused on women who did not have a diagnosis of precancer or cancer during the main study to evaluate the prospective risk of cervical disease within 2-3 years after the study visit. Since enrollment was completed in summer 2011, DCEG plans to conduct further follow-up studies of women at least through the FY2014. Follow-up will include clinical database searches at the University of Oklahoma, participant tracking in the state of Oklahoma, and retrieval of cervical cancer screening information for identified participants. 8. Ultrasound Tomography Breast Imaging Study: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that changes in breast density are related to changes in breast cancer risk. In collaboration with studiesers at the University of Toronto and the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit, Michigan, DCEG is using a novel ultrasound tomography (UST) scanner to define the time course of volumetric breast density changes among up to 150 women receiving tamoxifen therapy and an equal number of controls matched on age, race and menopausal status. Tamoxifen is known to reduce breast density and breast cancer risk. Since August 2011, DCEG has been enrolling women at Karmanos Cancer Institute to undergo repeated volumetric breast density assessment with UST. DCEG is currently exploring expansion of the study to include recruitment at Henry Ford Hosptial, also located in Detroit, MI. DCEG plans to continue to recruit and follow participants through 2014. The support services contract was used to help develop study materials (screening eligibility forms, telephone scripts, questionnaires, blood and saliva collection forms, bar-coded biospecimen labels, manuals, procedures for maintaining quality control, data entry systems, and an electronic study management system to facilitate participant tracking and follow-up). The support services contract also developed breast tissue collection and

N02CP31007-72

Attachment 3 - Background Statement Page 10 of 14

shipping protocols and prepared kits and labels for use in the field. The support services contract has interacted with study personnel in Detroit via teleconference calls on a weekly basis as well as on periodic site visits in order to aid in monitoring of recruitment and study procedures. The support services contract generates reports of completed visits to aid recruitment discussions. Data collection forms are submitted periodically to the support services contract for data entry and quality control checks. Accrual and participant follow-up is anticipated to continue through 2014. The current study fills a gap in the literature by evaluating density changes related to tamoxifen within a time period of months and assessing the utility of UST as a tool for measuring volumetric density and changes in density over short intervals. These findings may provide support for interventions aimed at reducing density as well as for investigations of how density changes relate to breast cancer risk. In addition, this is one of few studies to assess breast density among African American women, who comprise 50% of the target population. New Studies Envisioned DCEG anticipates possibly starting several new major initiatives during the first two years of the new support services contract. These include the following. 1. Breast Milk Study: Supported in part by resources from a recently funded bench-to-bedside award, HREB will pilot and then enroll postpartum women into a full scale study to explore the role of pregnancy, lactation and post-weaning breast remodeling in breast cancer risk. Increasing evidence supports the importance of these early adult life experiences in the etiology of certain types of early onset aggressive breast cancers, including basal breast cancers, which are difficult to detect and treat and disproportionately affect African American women. This study will recruit patients at local institutions such as Holy Cross Hospital and the NIH Clinical Center and will include the collection of breast milk for analysis of biomarkers. The support services contract will figure prominently in providing logistical support for identifying and recruiting eligible subjects, collecting questionnaire data, and collecting breast milk samples. Study planning commenced in April 2012 and the field effort began in the fall of 2012 and will continue for a minimum of 18 months. If successful, the conduct of a full-scale study could continue through the life of this contract. 2. Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: In the future DCEG plans to utilize the support services contract to conduct a case-control study of esophageal adenocarcinoma based in the Department of Defense. It is envisioned that the support services contract will help develop the protocols and associated forms, assist the field work efforts including management and oversight, coordinate the logistics of biospecimen collection and retrieval, manage data collected from questionnaires, and help coordinate analytic activities. The support services contract will need to be able to provide expertise in planning and conducting epidemiologic field work including knowledge about biospecimen collection and processing as well as data collection techniques (questionnaire design) and post-processing. Being able to manage large complex datasets and respond effectively to requests of such will also be important in post-recruitment analytic activities of the study. A general timeline is to start the approval process during FY2013, and then develop materials at the beginning of FY2014. DCEG then envisions starting field work in FY2015 and anticipate this will last one year for retrospective case recruitment and data linkage. Data management and biospecimen expertise will be essential throughout the developmental and fieldwork stages, as well as the two years of analysis that will follow the field work stage. 3. Expansion of the India Project: In the first two years of the support services contract, DCEG anticipates the expansion of the Intramural-to-India study to include possible expansion of recruitment as well as the longitudinal follow-up (at 6 months, 1 year, and beyond) of the HIV-

N02CP31007-72

Attachment 3 - Background Statement Page 11 of 14

infected women initially enrolled in the cross-sectional study. The support services contract can be expected to both support field efforts and facilitate laboratory assays. This effort will include Linear Array HPV assays similar to the first phase of the project, but also additional newer biomarkers or immunological markers for analysis of the stored samples in the study. Furthermore, the support services contract can be expected to facilitate the quality assurance testing for the subset of the histology and cytology samples that will be shipped from India to the U.S. Transfer of these valuable specimens will require coordination of shipments following appropriate international guidelines for biohazardous material, as well as coordination with various laboratories/institutions to aggregate various components of the quality assurance data. The Intramural-to-India study planning commenced in January 2012, and all regulatory approvals were received in November 2012. The field efforts are underway and clinical recruitment will begin in March 2013 and will extend up to 12 months. If successful, the launch of the longitudinal follow-up component could continue through the life of this contract. 4. Testicular Cancer: Based on the findings of the ongoing study of Norwegian men in the JANUS-TGCT project, DCEG may decide to utilize the support services contract to conduct a study of endogenous hormones and testicular cancer risk among men in the military. The design of the study will follow that of the Servicemen's Testicular Environmental and Endocrine Determinants Study (STEED) DCEG previously conducted with the military. DCEG will identify all men who developed TGCT while on active duty who have contributed serum samples to the Department of Defense Serum Repository in Silver Spring, Maryland. These men will be matched to servicemen who donated a serum sample and did not develop TGCT. The complete panel of steroid hormones and gonadotropins which are found to be associated with TGCT in the Norwegian study will be confirmed in the proposed military study. Due to insufficient serum volume in the Norwegian study, gonadotropin levels will not be determined. Thus the military study may add new insight into the key hormonal defect(s) related to TGCT. The support services contract will be used to provide expertise in planning and conducting the field work for the study. 5. Volatile Organic Compounds in Relation to Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: If pilot work is successful, DCEG plans to undertake a full scale analysis of volatile organic compounds in the breath in relation to esophageal adenocarcinoma, with an endoscopy-negative control population for comparison. The support services contract will be used to help develop materials (IRB, protocols, a short questionnaire, etc.), coordinate study centers, biospecimens and data, and provide general assistance with the conduct of such a project. DCEG envisions that the development of materials will start in late FY2013 and continue through FY2014 during which year DCEG will begin field work. Field work is anticipated to last two years and will include 3-4 centers. Data analysis will begin in FY2016. Study development and management expertise will be essential for the conduct of this project.

Environmentally Preferable Products and Services Environmentally Preferable Products (EPP) are products or services that have a lesser or reduced effect on human health and the environment when compared with competing products or services that serve the same purpose. This comparison may consider raw materials acquisition, production, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, reuse, operation, maintenance, or disposal of the products or services. Examples of environmentally preferable products include cleaning products that are non-toxic, non-volatile, and biodegradable; and paint with no or low volatile organic compounds. This program is managed by EPA which maintains a database of products and specifications defined by federal, state, and local agencies, and other nations. The database can be found at http://www.epa.gov/epp along with EPA's Guidance on the Acquisition of Environmentally Preferable Products and Services located at http://www.epa.gov/epp/pubs/index.htm Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) Products EPEAT is a tool for evaluating the environmental performance of electronic products throughout their life cycle. EPEAT is intended to help purchasers in the public and private sectors evaluate, compare and select desktop computers, notebooks and monitors based on their environmental attributes. EPEAT also provides a clear and consistent set of performance criteria for the design of products, and provides an opportunity for manufacturers to secure market recognition for efforts to reduce the environmental impact of its products. Available at: http://www.epeat.net/ Water-Efficient Products A water-efficient product is in the upper 25% of water efficiency for all similar products, or is at least 10% more efficient than the minimum level meeting U.S. Federal Government standards. Examples of products that have met the EPA WaterSense label include: high efficiency toilets, sink faucets, showerheads, urinals, and landscape irrigation systems. Information about the WaterSense Program is available at www.epa.gov/watersense. Non-Ozone Depleting Substances E.O. 13423 and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Implementing Instructions require that each agency give preference to the purchase of non-ozone depleting substances, as identified in EPA's Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program. FAR 23.803 states that agencies shall give preference to the procurement of alternative products that reduce overall risks to human health and the environment by lessening the depletion of ozone in the upper stratosphere. It further requires that in preparing specifications and purchase descriptions, and the acquisition of supplies and services, agencies shall comply with the requirements of the Clean Air Act and substitute safe alternatives to ozone-depleting substances. SNAP provides lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes in the following sectors: fire N02CP31007-72

The law does not apply to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers whose sole source of applicable federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed. Failure to comply with the provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an administrative compliance order on the responsible entity. By submission of its signed offer, the offeror/contractor (for acquisitions) or applicant/grantee (for grants) certifies that the submitting organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act. The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.

Motor Vehicle Administration and State vital statistics offices, private agencies, and other third parties (such as current or prior employers, acquaintances, relatives), when necessary to obtain information on morbidity and mortality experiences and to locate individuals for follow-up studies. Social security numbers, date of birth and other identifiers may be disclosed: (1) to the National Center for Health Statistics to ascertain vital status through the National Death Index; (2) to the Health Care Financing Agency to ascertain morbidities; and (3) to the Social Security Administration to ascertain disabilities and/or location of participants. Social security numbers may also be given to other Federal agencies, and State and local agencies when necessary to locating individuals for participation in follow-up studies. 6. Medical information may be disclosed in identifiable form to tumor registries for maintenance of health statistics, e.g., for use in research studies. 7. PHS may inform the sexual and/or needle-sharing partner(s) of a subject individual who is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) of their exposure to HIV, under the following circumstances: (1) The information has been obtained in the course of clinical activities at PHS facilities carried out by PHS personnel or contractors; (2) The PHS employee or contractor has made reasonable efforts to counsel and encourage the subject individual to provide the information to the individual's sexual or needle-sharing partner(s); (3) The PHS employee or contractor determines that the subject individual is unlikely to provide the information to the sexual or needle-sharing partner(s) or that the provision of such information cannot reasonably be verified; and (4) The notification of the partner(s) is made, whenever possible, by the subject individual's physician or by a professional counselor and shall follow standard counseling practices. PHS may disclose information to State or local public health departments, to assist in the notification of the subject individual's sexual and/or needle-sharing partner(s), or in the verification that the subject individual has notified such sexual or needle-sharing partner(s). 8. Certain diseases and conditions, including infectious diseases, may be reported to appropriate representatives of State or Federal Government as required by State or Federal law. 9.

Disclosure may be made for the purpose of reporting child, elder or spousal abuse or neglect or any other type of abuse or neglect as required by State or Federal law. POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR STORING, RETRIEVING, ACCESSING, RETAINING, AND DISPOSING OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM: STORAGE: Records may be stored on index cards, file folders, computer tapes and disks (including optical disks), photography media, microfiche, microfilm, and audio and video tapes. For certain studies, factual data with study code numbers are stored on computer tape or disk, while the key to personal identifiers is stored separately, without factual data, in paper/computer files. RETRIEVABILITY: During data collection stages and follow-up, retrieval is by personal identifier (e.g., name, social security number, medical record or study identification number, etc.). During the data analysis stage,

data are normally retrieved by the variables of interest (e.g., diagnosis, age, occupation). SAFEGUARDS: 1. Authorized Users: Access to identifiers and to link files is strictly limited to the authorized personnel whose duties require such access. Procedures for determining authorized access to identified data are established as appropriate for each location. Personnel, including contractor personnel, who may be so authorized include those directly involved in data collection and in the design of research studies, e.g., interviewers and interviewer supervisors; project managers; and statisticians involved in designing sampling plans. Other one-time and special access by other employees is granted on a need-to-know basis as specifically authorized by the system manager. Researchers authorized to conduct research on biologic specimens will typically access the system through the use of encrypted identifiers sufficient to link individuals with records in such a manner that does not compromise confidentiality of the individual. 2. Physical Safeguards: Records are either stored in locked rooms during off-duty hours, locked file cabinets, and/or secured computer facilities. For certain studies, personal identifiers and link files are separated and stored in locked files. Computer data access is limited through the use of key words known only to authorized personnel. 3. Procedural Safeguards: Collection and maintenance of data is consistent with legislation and regulations in the protection of human subjects, informed consent, confidentiality, and confidentiality specific to drug and alcohol abuse patients where these apply. When anonymous data is provided to research scientists for analysis, study numbers which can be matched to personal identifiers will be eliminated, scrambled, or replaced by the agency or contractor with random numbers which cannot be matched. Contractors who maintain records in this system are instructed to make no further disclosure of the records. Privacy Act requirements are specifically included in contracts for survey and research activities related to this system. The OHS project directors, contract officers, and project officers oversee compliance with these requirements. Personnel having access are trained in Privacy Act requirements. Depending upon the sensitivity of the information in the record, additional safeguard measures may be employed. 4. Implementation Guidelines: These practices are in compliance with the standards of Chapter 4513 of the HHS General Administration Manual, "Safeguarding Records Contained in Systems of Records," supplementary Chapter PHS hf: 45-13, and the HHS Automated Information Systems Security Program Handbook. RETENTION AND DISPOSAL: Records are retained and disposed of under the authority of the NIH Records Control Schedule contained in NIH Manual Chapter 1743, Appendix 1B "Keeping and Destroying Records" (HHS Records Management Manual, Appendix B-361), item 3000-G-3, which allows records to be kept as long as they are useful in scientific research. Collaborative Perinatal Project records are retained in accordance with item 3000-G-4, which does not allow records to be destroyed. Refer to the NIH Manual Chapter for specific conditions on disposal or retention instructions. SYSTEM MANAGER(S) AND ADDRESS(ES): See Appendix I for a listing of current System Managers. This system is for use by all NIH Institutes and Centers. NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE: To determine if a record exists, write to the appropriate IC Privacy Act Coordinator listed below. In

cases where the requester knows specifically which System Manager to contact, he or she may contact the System Manager directly (See Appendix I). Notification requests should include: individual's name; current address; date of birth; date, place and nature of participation in specific research study; name of individual or organization administering the research study (if known); name or description of the research study (if known); address at the time of participation; and in specific cases, a notarized statement (some highly sensitive systems require two witnesses attesting to the individual's identity). A requester must verify his or her identity by providing either a notarization of the request or by submitting a written certification that the is who he or she claims to be and understands that the knowing and willful request for acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Act, subject to a five thousand dollar fine. Individuals will be granted direct access to their medical records unless the System Manager determines that such access is likely to have an adverse effect (i.e., could cause harm) on the individual. In such cases when the System Manager has determined that the nature of the record information requires medical interpretation, the subject of the record shall be requested to designate, in writing, a responsible representative who will be willing to review the record and inform the subject individual of its contents at the representative's discretion. The representative may be a physician, other health professional, or other responsible individual. In this case, the medical/dental record will be sent to the designated representative. Individuals will be informed in writing if the record is sent to the representative. This same procedure will apply in cases where a parent or guardian requests notification of, or access to, a child's or incompetent person's medical record. The parent or guardian must also verify (provide adequate documentation) their relationship to the child or incompetent person as well as his or her own identity to prove their relationship. If the requester does not know which Institute or Center Privacy Act Coordinator to contact for notification purposes, he or she may contact directly the NIH Privacy Act Officer at the following address: NIH Privacy Act Officer, Office of Management Assessment, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 601L, Rockville, MD 20852.
