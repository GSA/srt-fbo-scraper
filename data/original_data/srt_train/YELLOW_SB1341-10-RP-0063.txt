HIT Testing Infrastructure Project Statement of Work  June, 2010 

 

1.0 Introduction The purpose of this National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) statement of work document is to describe the overall objectives, approach, and preliminary needs and plans (to date) necessary to fully execute a Health Information Technology (HIT) Testing Infrastructure project. It is organized as follows: ˇ Section 1.0 Introduction: Describes the overall high-level structure of the Statement of Work, reference documents, project background, purpose, scope, key project objectives, and likely stakeholders. Section 2.0 Requirements and Task Areas: Identifies the high-level requirements across multiple layers to meet the different healthcare stakeholder needs and narrows in on component, high-level functional, and design tasks. Section 3.0 HIT Testing Infrastructure Organization: Addresses the need for overall project organizational requirements including deliverables, documentation and communication methods used throughout the project. Section 4.0 Administrative Requirements: Identifies the administrative expectations and requirements deemed necessary to carry out the testing infrastructure phases.

ˇ

ˇ

ˇ

1.1 Reference Document and Site The following documents are used as the basis to further understand and identify the need for the HIT Testing Infrastructure Project work statement: ˇ ˇ American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgibin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h1enr.txt.pdf) Department of Health and Human Services Health IT Meaningful Use web site (http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=1325&parentname=Communit yPage&parentid=6&mode=2&in_hi_userid=10741&cached=true)

1.2 Project Background The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 emphasizes the need for the U.S. to move toward electronic health records. The legislation calls out the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), in part, to establish a Health Information Technology Testing Infrastructure (HITTI) that supports effective industry consensus standards development processes and provides the U.S. healthcare IT industry and federal activities with robust conformance and interoperability testing capabilities. NIST will be responsible for leading the development of the core HITTI that will provide a scalable, multi-partner, automated, remote capability for current and future testing needs. An initial emphasis will be on testing the standards addressing high national healthcare priorities (e.g., as identified and/or defined in concept of Electronic Health Record (eHR) technology "meaningful use"). NIST will work with standards and specification development organizations and other stakeholders to ensure appropriate feedback mechanisms exist for updating the standards.
                                                             HIT Testing Infrastructure Project SOW  June, 2010                                                         3 

 

1.3 Project Objectives and Scope The objective of the HITTI Project is to harmonize the efforts of healthcare standards test development and delivery to meet the demands for conformance and interoperability within the healthcare domain. This is accomplished by working in collaboration with health IT stakeholders such as vendors, implementers, standards organizations, and certification bodies to establish a testing infrastructure that will: ˇ Provide a variety of conformance and interoperability testing services: The infrastructure will define a set of services including healthcare application test agents and reference implementations, tools to validate standards, tools to generate test materials, and registries and repositories to support testing. The testing services form the basis to conduct conformance and interoperability testing of healthcare data exchange standards. Support a broad range of test environments: The infrastructure will support multiple testing environments including instance validation testing, isolated system testing, and peer-to-peer system testing. The testing may occur on-site (e.g., testing that is conducted in-house at a vendor's or software tester's location in which the system under test and test tool/system are local) or be remote (e.g., testing via the internet where system testing is conducted remotely). Support numerous health data exchange standards: The infrastructure will provide services to test health workflows that employ multiple messaging and document data exchange standards. Provide a component-based user interface: The infrastructure will include multiple components that will enable different stakeholders to use the infrastructure in different ways. Enable user customization: The infrastructure will allow different stakeholders to build their own instances of the testing services to support their individual needs. Support changing user requirements: The infrastructure will provide a framework that is modular, flexible, and expandable to meet changing stakeholder demands. Provide a feedback loop to enhance the health standards: The infrastructure will provide a mechanism that will provide valuable feedback about the health data exchange standards and specifications.

ˇ

ˇ

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

The following items are not within scope and shall not be considered part of the HITTI: ˇ ˇ ˇ Developing standards ­ NIST will not create standards; this project will develop an infrastructure necessary to test implementations of existing standards and/or specifications. Performing certifications ­ NIST will not perform product certification; this project will provide the test infrastructure and tools that can be used by recognized certification bodies. Conducting operational testing ­ NIST will not conduct any type of operational or functional testing; this project will provide the software test tools that can be leveraged by the stakeholder organizations for their testing processes.

2.0 Requirements and Task Areas This section provides the high-level task area requirements for the framework along with the components comprising the scope of this requirement. The requirements of the HITTI project that the contractor shall address are provided in tabular form in Section 2.3.1 below. 2.1 High Level Requirements The Contractor shall insure the HITTI project addresses the following high level requirements: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Provision for a variety of testing services Support a broad range of test environments Support multiple delivery mechanisms Support numerous health data exchange standards (including HL7 V2, HL7 V3, DICOM, and CDA documents, and vocabularies and code sets) Provide a component-based user interface

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

Enable user customization Support changing user requirements Provide a feedback loop to enhance the health standards Define supporting components including interfaces, common file formats, test scenario and test scenario description language

2.2 Scoping the High Level Requirements To accomplish these requirements, the Contractor shall insure the framework conceptually contains multiple layers that meet the different health IT stakeholder needs. Figure 2 (see below) depicts what NIST visualizes to be the major pieces of the framework. The terminology used to describe the framework is used only to convey to the contractor the conceptual view of what constitutes the HITTI.

Components Test Environments Test Scenarios Process Execution Services

Figure 2: Testing Infrastructure Conceptual View

ˇ ˇ

Components are the highest level of the infrastructure and define the overarching category of functionality to be defined for the HITTI (e.g. test execution and test management). Environments are the specific types of functionality within a defined component. For example, with regard to `Test Execution', it is expected that there are at least three test environments including instance testing, isolated system testing, and peer-to-peer testing. Scenarios are the depiction of a sequence of processes and services within a specific environment to demonstrate interactions within a system and between systems. For example, within instance testing, one test scenario would show steps involved to validate a clinical document.

ˇ

HIT Testing Infrastructure Project SOW                                                           7  June, 2010

 

ˇ

Process Execution is the test harness which orchestrates services to produce an executable implementation of the testing scenarios. A management control system may provide input (test scripts) that directs the actions within process execution. An example process execution for the C32 HITSP `Summary Documents Using HL7 Continuity of Care Document' (CCD) validation would be to send an artifact and return validation result(s). Services are formally specified functions based on the activities they perform. Each service has well defined responsibilities and authority. Services work together in collaboration to support the test scenarios. Example services include test agents, validators, test generators, and repositories.

ˇ

The contractor shall, at a minimum, define and propose a model which includes in some manner the conceptual layers described. To elaborate, Table 2 below provides examples of the framework for the HITTI project. The framework identified will be used as a basis for further defining (or refining) the requirements of components across both a user and system views.

2.3 Baseline High Level Requirements A high level framework has been conceptualized by NIST to identify baseline requirements for the HITTI project. During the requirements development phase, specific scenarios shall be developed for each component by the Contractor. These scenarios shall identify the processes and services that are required. Additional requirements will likely be discovered and defined throughout the project. Subsequent and more detailed scenarios as discovered and refined through an iterative process shall be identified and defined in the requirements and design phase by the contractor. 2.3.1 Functional Requirements The following table provides the requested required capabilities and sub-capabilities along with the refined requirement text to be addressed by the contractor. Capability SubCapability Requirement Text The HITTI project shall address the following high level requirements: ˇ Provision for a variety of conformance and interoperability testing services ˇ Support a broad range of test environments ˇ Support numerous health data exchange standards including multiple messaging and document data exchange standards including HL7 V2, HL7 V3, DICOM, and CDA documents ˇ Provide a component-based user interface ˇ Enable user customization ˇ Support changing user requirements ˇ Provide a feedback loop to enhance the health standards ˇ Define supporting components including interfaces, common file formats, test scenario and test scenario description language

Requirement Text

Test Management

Test management environments directly relate to test execution environments. The contractor shall make a determination of what types of management environments are needed, if there is to be any delineation. I.e., it is not yet clear if test management environments need to be supported, much in the same way that test execution is necessary. For example, the following management environments may need to be supported. Test ˇ Instance (conformance/unit) management - the Environments management of testing an artifact (e.g., an HL7 V2 message) against the rules defined in the specification. ˇ Isolated system (integration) management - the management of a single vendor system conducting a test with one or more standard(s) or one or more specification(s). ˇ Peer to peer (interoperability) management - the management of testing conducted among a group of vendor systems. Scenarios Process Execution The contractor shall depict a sequence of processes and/or services that define the set-up of test management. The contractor shall develop the orchestration services necessary to produce executable implementation of the management scenarios. The contractor shall define and develop formal functions to perform management services. For example, such services may include tester registration for specific environments, tester assignments based on the test environment as well as generating test reports.

Requirement Text The contractor shall devise testing models which are to include different test modes and test grading. By `test mode' this statement of work refers to whether the testing is conducted on-site or remotely. Test modes devised by the contractor shall be in alignment and match the test environments defined in the test management capability (above). ˇ `On-site testing' refers to system testing that is conducted in-house at the vendor's or software tester's location. In other words, the system under test (i.e., software application/system being evaluated) and the test tool (i.e., software and/or network used to evaluate) are located on the same physical site. ˇ `Remote testing' refers to system testing that is conducted remotely (i.e., not on the same physical site), for example, over the Internet. The contractor shall depict a sequence of processes and/or services within a specific environment to demonstrate interactions within a system and between systems. The contractor shall orchestrate a service portfolio to produce an executable implementation of the testing scenarios suitable for HIT stakeholders.

Requirement Text The test tooling developed by NIST to date will be made available to the contractor upon award by the NIST COTR. This tooling addresses subsets of requirements from standards groups across several delivery mechanisms. In conjunction with devising an HIT test infrastructure, the contractor shall evaluate and make determinations if and how appropriate the state of existing tooling is with regard to the functional model. Services provided by the contractor within the HITTI framework shall include healthcare application test agents (i.e., implementation of actors [or applications] that support the functionality of the underlying specification of the actor), tools to validate against standards, test material generation, and test material registries and repositories. A key characteristic of the framework is that it shall be extensible--for example, test agents can be added to support new application functionality. The framework, through process execution, shall afford users the flexibility to select the approach, resources, and environment in which they want to conduct testing. Additionally the framework shall be scalable since the set of services are independent and service composition as well as the execution of the tests can occur spatially. The framework shall also support rapid test suite development since each instance can be built independently and simultaneously. Stakeholders, whether it is a certification body or vendors testing in-house, shall have the flexibility to build the testing system such that their requirements are met.

Requirement Text The HITTI high level functional design shall be composed of services which are managed in such a way to enable executable implementation of the testing workflow using common support components. ˇ Services included in the HITTI shall include (at a minimum): ­ Test Agents - implementation of actors (or applications) that support the functionality of the underlying specification of the actor. The test agent does not have to be a complete implementation; it needs to only support the functionality of the actor to support testing of applications. However, over time a test agent can become a reference implementation. Potentially hundreds of actors will exist in this framework-- although for any one give test typically 5 or fewer will be employed. The distributed nature (e.g., of the SOA) shall allow for test agents to be built independently and maintained at different locations. ­ Generation - the creation of test material such as messages and documents. ­ Validation - provide an evaluation function for a given protocol. ­ Registry/Repository - repository containing testing artifacts needed in testing. The registry shall provide mechanisms to organize, maintain, and retrieve the artifacts. The Registry/Repository maintains the current specifications, schematron rules, profiles, test messages, etc. to support testing. ­ Additional services ­ include logging, log analyzer(s), test data, etc.

Requirement Text The contractor shall propose and architect a test management system that enables test case, report set up, and maintain results. The contractor shall propose and architect a process execution test harnesses which orchestrates services to produce an executable implementation of the testing workflow. Services shall be assembled in a particular order (as defined in the requirements phase) and follow a set of rules to carry-out a test case. The contractor shall compose services in a manner that allows straightforward and flexible test development. The contractor is required to devise the service composition with a sufficient level of complexity to enable the test system composition to be at the discretion of the user. In other words the contractor shall enable the user to `stamp out' a test system to meet their needs, which in nearly all cases will be a subset of the services and components encapsulated in the HITTI. The contractor's proposed model(s) shall enable easy modification to test cases--and shall allow quick adaption to changing requirements in test cases. A management control system shall be proposed and architected and shall provide input (test scripts) functionality that directs the actions of the process execution. The devised process execution shall be developed in a manner that carries out the instructions by employing the services. As background, NIST believes there are many choices available for implementing process execution. These may include powerful process execution languages (e.g., BPEL [Business Process Execution Language], a web browser client with scripting language support, or a high-level programming language such as Java). The execution language employed is left to the contractor to propose and implement. However, the framework shall support any number of process execution implementations. Operationally, the contractor shall allow multipleindependent instances of process execution implementations such that they can be carried out simultaneously. The contractor shall recommend and justify an appropriate process execution solution(s).

As used in this clause-"Contract" as defined in FAR 2.101, means a mutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services (including construction) and the buyer to pay for them. It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16.

"Jobs created" means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as "full-time equivalent" (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. "Jobs retained" means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101).

Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis SB1341-10-RP-0063 Page - 37

SECTION L INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS techniques.

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M.1

1352.215-74

BEST VALUE EVALUATION

(APR 2010)

(a) Award will be made to the offeror: whose offer conforms to the solicitation requirements; who is determined responsible in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.1 by possessing the financial and other capabilities to fulfill the requirements of the contract; and whose proposal is judged, by an integrated assessment of price/cost and non-price evaluation factors, to provide the best value to the Government in accordance with CAR 1352.215-75, Evaluation Criteria. (b) The Government intends to award a time and materials type contract in response to the solicitation. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract depending on the quality of the proposals submitted and the availability of funds. (c) Evaluation of Proposals (1) Initial Evaluation of Proposals. All offers received will be evaluated in accordance with the stated evaluation factors. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions based solely upon initial proposals. Therefore, offerors should ensure that their initial proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed. If award is not made upon initial proposals, then the Contracting Officer will establish a competitive range comprised of the most highly rated proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly- rated proposals. Only those offerors in the competitive range will be offered an opportunity to participate further in the procurement. (2) Discussions/Final Proposal Revisions. The Contracting Officer will engage in discussions with all offerors in the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306. NIST may ask Offerors to demonstrate a previously and similarly developed software system in a meeting with and at NIST not to exceed 2 hours. Only those offerors found in the competitive range will be asked for such a demonstration. Demonstrations will be held at the NIST Gaithersburg site located at 100 Bureau Drive, Building 222, Conference Room A340, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899. At the conclusion of discussions, a final common cut-off date for submission of final proposal revisions will be established. Those offerors remaining in the competitive range will be notified to submit Final Proposal Revisions. (3) Final Evaluation of Offers. A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revisions. (End of clause) M.2 1352.215-75 EVALUATION CRITERIA (APR 2010)

(a) In determining which proposal provides the best value to the Government, non-price (technical) evaluation factors are more important than evaluated price. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the relative strengths, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and risks of each Offeror's proposal in accordance with the evaluation factors below. The proposals will be evaluated using information submitted by each Offeror on the five factors below. They are: ˇ ˇ ˇ Methodology (Technical Approach) Corporate Experience Key Personnel

SB1341-10-RP-0063 Page - 46

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD ˇ ˇ Past Perfromance Cost/Price

Methodology (Technical Approach) is slightly more important than Corporate Experience, Key Personnnel and Past Performance. Corporate Experience, Key Personnel, and Past Performance, are listed above in descending order of importantance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. In any case, the Government reserves the right to make an award to that Offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government. Based upon the results of the integrated assessment of the technical and cost/price proposals, the Government may make an award to other than the lowestpriced offeror or the offeror with the highest technical score if the source selection official determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government. (b) TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS 1. Specific Evaluation Criteria Technical proposals will be evaluated and must provide information on all of the following criteria: a) Factor 1 ­ METHODOLOGY (TECHNICAL APPROACH).

The proposal will be evaluated on how the offeror intends to organize staff and manage the contract and the means that will be used to accomplish the contract requirements. The degree to which the proposal demonstrates an understanding of the requirements will be evaluated, as well as the offeror's planned management of consultants and subcontractors, if applicable. Proposals which simply give back or repeat the provided requirements will not be considered as this demonstrates the required capabilities are not fully understood or assimilated. b) Factor 2 ­ CORPORATE EXPERIENCE. Experience with focus on large and complex information technology and software test systems will be evaluated to determine the overall expertise of personnel and quality of the products and services provided by the Contractor and Subcontractors. The proposal will be evaluated to assess the corporate experience and past performance of the Offeror with respect to projects of similar in scope and size to the work described herein. Offerors must demonstrate proven experience and past performance in the areas identified the functional requirements. c) Factor 3 -KEY PERSONNEL.

(1) The education, experience, and accomplishments of key personnel will be evaluated to determine the degree to which they possess the qualifications to perform their proposed duties under the contract. The Offeror proposal shall include a list of names and proposed duties of the key personnel assigned to the project that will materially contribute to the leadership, planning, and advancement of this effort. List the expected level of participation of each individual expressed in hours. This should include consultants, and key subcontractor employees assigned to the project. Their resumes should be included and should contain information on education, background, recent experience, and specific scientific or technical accomplishments. (2) For each of the proposed personnel, the Offeror must indicate whether the person is: ˇ currently employed by the offeror; ˇ planning to join the company; SB1341-10-RP-0063 Page - 47

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD ˇ ˇ a proposed subcontractor's employee; or to be obtained through other arrangements.

(3) Letters of commitment shall be provided for persons not current employed by the offeror or proposed subcontractor d) Factor 4 ­PAST PERFORMANCE

(1)Evaluation of past experience is based on the references provided and/or the offeror's recent and relevant procurement history with components identified by NIST. The offeror's background, experience, and qualifications will be assessed to determine the likelihood that the offeror can successfully perform the contract requirements and the degree of the risk of non-performance. (2)The offeror's past performance on relevant contracts will be evaluated to determine, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, effective management of subcontractors, cost management, level of communication between the contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction. (3)The Government reserves the right to assess the past performance of proposed subcontractors. (4)The Government will use its discretion to determine the sources of past performance information used in the evaluation, and the information may be obtained from references provided by the offeror, the agency's knowledge of contractor performance, other government agencies or commercial entities, or past performance databases. (5)If an offeror does not have a history of relevant contract experience, or if past performance information is not available, the offeror will receive a neutral past performance rating; however, an offeror without a history of relevant experience may receive a lowered rating for the experience evaluation factor.

2. SPECIFIC COST/PRICE FACTOR (a) FACTOR 5 -Cost/Price Evaluation

(1) The proposed prices/costs will be evaluated but not scored. The cost evaluation will determine whether the proposed costs are realistic, complete, and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. Proposed costs must be entirely compatible with the technical proposal. (2) The Government may use the results of cost/price realism analysis to adjust the offeror's proposal to a most probable cost to the Government. The analysis may include information from a government auditing agency, Government technical personnel, and other sources. (End of clause)
