                                                           SERVICE AUTHORIZATION (CSA)

                                                                  March 8, 2013







1.   Scope.

   1.0.1.   General Requirements.  This Statement of Work (SOW) is a comprehensive description of local exchange access services, analog and
   digital access transport services, and intra-Local Access Transport Area (LATA) interconnect functions.    The Contractor shall be facilities
   based either locally or by region and shall provide all transmission facilities, equipment, materials, maintenance, test equipment, and
   design layout needed to perform and provide local access and transport services and functions at the designated demarcation point.  This
   includes the contractor’s ability to install PRIs and the capability to port all currently existing DIDs and CSL(s) where applicable.  These
   services shall include any special items, equipment, wiring or infrastructure to ensure the Contractor’s proposed solution is compatible with
   the government’s current infrastructure.  The contractor is responsible for troubleshooting and maintaining the operation of the circuit up
   to its termination point.  Access to the local exchange shall include:  operator assistance, emergency 911/E911 services/functions,
   circuits/trunks to base DMARC and 911/E911 database maintenance where applicable.  These services shall not include residential/business
   services for non-Government entities or Government Contractors.  Long distance services for  Edwards AFB are currently being provided under
   the Networx contract or any subsequent follow-on contract established by DISA for long distance services and charges and are not authorized
   on this CSA. The contractor shall follow all Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Public Utility Commission (PUC), Department of Defense
   (DOD), Air Force (AF) and industry standards for this requirement.    The SOW Appendix 10 defines all current requirements for Edwards AFB.
   Appendix 10 may be modified to incorporate future requirements as they occur.




   1.0.2.   Competitive Economic Advantage Consideration.  The local exchange or Dial Central Office services provided for under the pricing,
   terms, and conditions of this contract are principally intended to meet known installation service requirements and an estimate of the type
   of services that may be required during the term of the contract.  Where the contracting officer determines usage of the contract to be cost
   effective and the contractor providing such services to the Government agrees and has the additional capability to provide services to other
   installations or agencies within 100 miles of the principal place of performance, orders may be placed for such additional services.  When an
   order is placed and the contractor initiates performance, all terms and conditions of this contract shall apply.

2.0.  Documents.  The contractor shall acquire a list of applicable industry standards that shall be followed in the performance of the
contract.  These documents shall be made available to the Government upon request.

3.0.  Requirements.

   3.0.1.   The Appendix 10 will identify the Local Commercial Communications Services required, including characteristics, quantities, and
   locations, as applicable.


   3.0.2.   The Communications Systems Officer (CSO) at the Government installation is responsible for telecommunications activities and will be
   identified in the Appendix 10.  After services are authorized by the 38th Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall coordinate with the CSO
   prior to the installation, removal, expansion, and/or change out of equipment.  Organizational office symbol for the CSO and technical
   representative will be identified in Appendix 10.


   3.0.3.   The Government will provide floor space for the installation of the Contractor’s provided transmission equipment.  The floor space
   shall be limited to accommodate Contractor-provided relay rack(s), 19 to 23 inches wide by 7 feet tall, as ceiling height permits at each
   designated demarcation.  Space is available for 1 or 2 relay rack(s) for Contractor equipment in the Demarcation Building as specified in the
   Appendix 10 of this SOW.  The Government will provide adequate wall space should the contractor not require floor/rack space.  The Government
   will provide electrical power and room environment for the installation of the Contractor equipment.  When additional rack space, floor
   space, or wall space is required to support Government requirements, the Contractor shall coordinate with the CSO.


3.1.  Local Commercial Communications Services.

   3.1.1.  Installation and Cutover.   The Contractor shall perform a site survey of the installation area after contract award.  The Contractor
   shall develop an installation and cutover plan for submittal to the Government no later than (NLT) 15 calendar days.  The Government requires
   15 working days to review and provide comments/acceptance.  The Contractor shall provide a final plan, NLT 10 working days, after receipt of
   the Government comments.  The Contractor shall not commence on-site installation and cutover until the Contractor receives Government
   acceptance of the service installation and cutover plan.  Installation of the initial required services for cutover of Local Commercial
   Communications Service requirements shall be as specified in the Appendix 10.  Installation, circuit assignments, all possible/applicable
   testing, records’ management, cutover and Government acceptance shall be completed NLT one hundred and eighty (180) days after contract award
   for larger Air Force Bases.  The Appendix 10 will identify the appropriate cutover and installation date requirements.  Deviations from the
   final Installation Plan will be coordinated with the Government prior to any work being accomplished in the affected area.  The contractor
   shall ensure that all circuits, equipment, and service provided by the incumbent, under the prior contract, are
   disconnected/discontinued/removed from site upon successful cutover.  In the event that the contract award is made to the incumbent
   Contractor, no installation/cutover plans will be required.  Any omissions or discrepancies in the installation and cutover plan does not
   relief the contractor’s responsibility to install, cutover and perform all services as identified in this requirement. It is the contractor’s
   responsibility to resolve any problems associated with these efforts.

              a.  Call blocking for Numbering Plan Area (NPA) 900 direct inward dialing direct outward dialing two-way dialing channelization of
                 digital trunks (as specified by work order) trunk busy tones, DTMF, MF 2/6 and dial pulse (DP) address signaling, access,
                 services trunk and/or trunk group establishment, automatic trunk member selection (sequential, linear, most idle, etc.)
                 automatic trunk group alternate route selection Toll free access


              b.  Access to and selection of the members within the trunk group between two telephone switching systems must be coordinated to
                 provide optimum member selection and minimize glare conditions.  When two or more trunk groups are established to provide
                 services between the switching systems, the alternate route selection from one trunk group to the next provides users’ access to
                 these trunk groups in a coordinated and predetermined routing sequence.  The selection of members within a trunk group and the
                 alternate route selection of two or more trunk groups are included as basic functions of trunks and their access.


         3.1.2.8.  Off Premise Extension (OPX).  OPX is an acronym for Off Premise Extension. This is an extension telephone that terminates in
         a location distant from its parent base switch. OPX is generally used to provide authorized base personnel with access to the base
         switch.  The OPX will have features and functions as designated by the base switch and CSO.  The OPX can have direct access to the
         Defense Switched Network (DSN) or the FTS systems or both.  OPX services will not extend beyond the LATA or state line boundary.

         3.1.2.9.  Point-to-Point Circuits.  Refers to a connection restricted to two endpoints.  A traditional point-to-point circuit is a
         communications medium with exactly two endpoints. The host equipment at either end has to take full responsibility for formatting the
         data transmitted between the two end points. Point to Point circuits will not extend beyond the LATA or state line boundary.

         3.1.2.10.  Bit Rate Interface (BRI) Circuits.  BRI (128 - 256 - 384 ....512kb) and/or any circuit provisioning to include 1.54T-1 must
         meet the end equipment requirements for our base multi-functions to connect and operate at layer 1 and layer 2.  Most circuits
         provisioned today come in 2-wire-line BRI (128kb each) - usually utilized for local video support.  BRI traffic (as with any locally
         received commercial circuits) is sent out to our serviced customer on dry cable pair to the end-device.  Past practices from local
         Telco, we receive new circuit on d-mark located at the main central office frame (MDF) - from there our techs will x-connect out to our
         cable plant and wire customer jack to RJ-45, RJ-48C as applicable.

         3.1.2.11.  Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS).  The Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) is a
         White House-directed emergency phone service provided by the National Communications System (NCS) in the Cyber Security &
         Communications Division, National Protection and Programs of the Department of Homeland Security. GETS supports Federal, State, local,
         and tribal government, industry, and non-governmental organization (NGO) personnel in performing their National Security and Emergency
         Preparedness (NS/EP) missions. GETS provides emergency access and priority processing in the local and long distance segments of the
         Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). It is intended to be used in an emergency or crisis situation when the PSTN is congested and
         the probability of completing a call over normal or other alternate telecommunication means has significantly decreased. The servicing
         LEC must have NPA (710) in their switch to allow access to the GETS line assigned to a specific site.  Dialing 0/1+710-NXX-XXXX
         provides access to an emergency service for authorized users. The 710 NPA provides access to a tariffed service of the GETS
         interexchange carriers (AT&T, MCI WorldCom, and Sprint) and the call is billed to the U.S. Government.



         NOTE – The Government does not provide the contractor to allow any 10-10 dial around access on awarded contracts.

   3.1.3.  Transport Services.  The Contractor shall provide local exchange transport channel services as specified in the Appendix 10.  Local

   4.9.2.  In the event keys, other than master keys, are lost or duplicated, the contractor may be required, upon written direction of the
   contracting officer, to re-key or replace the affected lock or locks without cost to the government.  The government may, however, at its
   option, replace the affected lock or locks or perform re-keying and deduct the cost of such from the monthly payment due the contractor.  In
   the event a master key is lost or duplicated, all locks and keys for that system shall be replaced by the government and the total cost
   deducted from the monthly payment due the contractor.

   4.9.3.  The contractor shall prohibit the use of keys, issued by the government, by any persons other than the contractor’s employees and the
   opening of locked areas by contractor employees to permit entrance of persons other than contractor employees engaged in performance of
   contract work requirements in those areas.

4.10.   Lock Combinations.  The contractor shall control access to all government provided lock combinations to preclude unauthorized entry.
The contractor is not authorized to record lock combinations without written approval by the CSO.  Records with written combinations to
authorized secure storage containers, secure storage rooms, or certified vaults, shall be marked and safeguarded at the highest classification
level as the classified material maintained inside the approved containers.
