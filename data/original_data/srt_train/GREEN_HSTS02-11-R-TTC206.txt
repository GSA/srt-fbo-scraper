Executive Summary
Background The mission of (DHS is to lead the unified national effort to secure America. DHS will prevent and deter terrorist attacks and protect against and respond to threats and hazards to the Nation. DHS will also secure our national borders while welcoming lawful immigrants, visitors, and trade. The mission of TSA is to protect the Nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. To support the missions of both DHS and TSA, TSA's Office of Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC) was established. TTAC's mission is to reduce the probability of a successful terrorist or other criminal attack to the transportation system through application of the threat assessment methodologies that are intended to identify known or suspected terrorist and/or criminal threats working or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system. These capabilities are an integral part of the Department's multi-layered approach to Homeland Defense. Capability Gap: Current TTAC enrollment, ID management, vetting, adjudication, investigations, redress, and credentialing infrastructure and services were created to support and monitor 2.5 million individuals per year. Today, the populations supported by TTAC have more than quintupled to 12.5 million individuals per year while operating resources have not kept pace. Serviced populations are expected to grow to 20 million individuals within the next 2 years, with a projected 40-50 million increase within the next five years, as the demand for TTAC population screening services continues to grow. As a result, TTAC must modernize its current infrastructure to meet the mission capabilities as linked to 2010 DHS and TSA mission drivers, and scale to meet mission needs of current and future populations.

Further, it is anticipated that over the next five years, existing stove-piped business processes and information systems will either be reengineered or replaced by new integrated business and technical enterprise architectures that will: Consolidate multiple enrollment methods Implement identity management services across programs Standardize the approach for customer relationship management Standardize the physical and virtual credentialing processes Standardize threat assessment processes Consolidate operations by integrating program-specific information technology (IT) systems and business processes into a common secure enterprise vetting and credentialing architecture. To address these concerns, TSA created the TTAC Infrastructure Modernization Program (TIM) to modernize the way it does business followed by the creation of the TIM Program Office (TIM PMO) to manage the Program.      

The mission of the TIM Program is to align and integrate current TTAC processes, services, and infrastructure through the development of an integrated system to more effectively and efficiently meet the TTAC mission and provide increased capability to accommodate future transportation sector populations. The TIM Program supports DHS and TSA's mission, by significantly improving the vetting and credentialing management and adjudication platform currently used for conducting security threat assessments (STAs) on various transportation populations through the consolidation of legacy services, and through the use of software applications, and a common IT infrastructure that includes consolidated knowledge based database architecture. The TIM Program presents an opportunity to eliminate redundant business practices, processes, and subsequent IT investments to achieve significant economies of scale associated with a unifying business integration effort. The TIM Program will interface operations, technologies, and other associated activities to DHS services including the Screening Coordination Office (SCO), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), US Visitor and Immigration Status Indictor Technology (USVISIT), US Citizen and Immigration Service (USCIS), and others as appropriate. The TIM Program will also interface with other Federal agencies as appropriate, including: Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) and US Federal critical infrastructure. The TIM Program's goals and objectives are aligned with the overall strategic plans o f DHS and its strategic goals including innovative use of analytical and detection technologies and techniques to collect and manage transportation population information regarding potential threats to persons, cargo, and commerce, and to share security and intelligence information to customers in a timely and efficient manner. Further, The TIM Program will support Vetting & Credentialing programs across the Department securing critical transportation infrastructure. The development of the TIM System will result in an integrated, end-to-end solution to manage the identities, credentials, and assessment results for millions of transportation sector workers as well as critical infrastructure. The TIM system will reflect and leverage lessons learned from years of managing diverse portfolio of screening programs. The TIM Architecture will meet the TTAC mission with more effective and efficient integrated systems balancing cost reduction with enhanced performance and provides for the incremental design and development of the TIM system by capability and will replace, rebuild, and/or reuse current legacy systems based on the results of an Analysis of Alternative. The TIM Program acquisition includes operations, technologies, and/or activities that interface with other DHS components. TIM will capitalize on significant economies of scale by consolidating business drivers/processes and by implementing Integrated and flexible technical architectures creating state-of-the-art vetting and credentialing services. The Initial Operations Capability (IOC) is anticipated in FY13. The transition of legacy systems will occur in spirals. TIM will encompass the following programs, populations, systems, and services, currently vetted by TTAC: (Note: This is not an exhaustive list)  Hazardous Material Endorsement Threat Assessment Program (HTAP), including the HME Screening Gateway (SG) System.

 

   

Transportation Worker Identification Credential Program (TWIC) Aviation Programs including: o Aviation Worker (AVW) Population o Indirect Air Carrier (IAC) Population o General Aviation (GA) Population Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP) International Crew Vetting Program (CVP) Colorado Springs Operation Center (CSOC) Vetting Consolidated Screening Gateway (CSG) System.

The importance of this program to DHS strategic plans and due to acquisition estimate(s) of $570 million over the next 10 years (pending development and approval of the life cycle cost estimate (LCCE)), the TIM Program is expected to be a Level 2 investment. This incremental development approach will achieve modernization objectives and mitigate implementation risks, while improving TTAC's program performance over a ten year lifecycle. The TIM Systems Development Life Cycle will require applying risk management as an important component of a successful IT security and system integrity regiment. The principal goal of TTAC's risk management process should be to protect the organization and its ability to perform their mission, not just to protect the IT assets. Therefore, the risk management process should not be treated primarily as a technical function carried out by the IT experts who operate and manage the IT system, but as an essential management function of the organization. Risk management will be applied in this instance both as a programmatic application, which is to ensure that the TTAC modernization project is successful with the end product having full operational applications with the adaptations of the applicable elements found in the Results Documentation and Risk Assessment Report. The TIM Program will develop a detailed Risk Management Program (RMP) to manage risks throughout the program's life cycle. As part of the RMP, a Risk Management Board (RMB) will be established to monitor and address all identified risks. Risk can be defined primarily as the negative impact of a vulnerable activity, considering the probability and the impact of occurrence. Risk management can be summarized as the process of identifying risk, assessing risk, and taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level. The core risk elements that this Risk Management Program will include, but not limited to, the analysis of the major systems component integration, Internal and external interfaces to data, systems and stakeholder and human factors. Risk Management Objectives The objectives of the TIM Program Risk Management Program include: 

Involve key resources to identify, manage and mitigate risks

      

Perform risk identification early in the life cycle of the program and on an ongoing basis (at least monthly) Develop comprehensive list of triggers for risk identification for the program objectives Define criteria used in measuring risk event consequences for the program objectives Analyze each risk thoroughly for the probability of its occurrence and impact on the program objectives Develop prioritized risk response plans and mitigation strategies and obtain approval by TIM Program Manager (PM) Prioritize accumulated significant program risks on a regular basis Execute each mitigation plan effectively according to the priority assigned to the risk.

Implementing risk management considering the above objectives will enable TTAC to accomplish its missions by: (1) better securing the IT systems that store, process, and transmit organizational information, (2) enabling management to make well-informed risk management decisions to support the expenditures for risk mitigation, and (3) assisting management in authorization (or accrediting) of IT systems based on supporting results documentation and risk assessment reports generated through the utilization of risk management practices.

A. Introduction
This RMP serves as the master planning document that describes risk management activities necessary to provide a foundation for the development of an effective risk management program using a practical approach to identifying, assessing and mitigating risks within the TIM Program. In addition, this plan provides information on the selection of cost-effective security controls. These controls can be used to mitigate risk for better protection of the mission-critical information and the IT systems that process, store, and carry sensitive information. A.1 Purpose This RMP represents the process for implementing and managing proactive risk management as part of the overall management of the TIM Program. The RMP serves as a program management tool to assess and mitigate events that might adversely impact TIM program thereby increasing the chance of success. Specifically, the RMP will accomplish the following objectives:  Develop and provide risk information for Milestone decisions  Serve as a basis for identifying alternatives to mitigate risks and achieve cost, schedule, and performance goals  Assist in making decisions on budget and funding priorities  Concentrate on the acquisition stages of the project from its initiation to completion  Provide output to be used by TSA TIM PMO and TTAC managers for periodic reporting of risks and risk management strategies and their status for OMB Exhibit 300 reporting for the program. A.2 Risk Management Organization The TIM program RMB, chaired by the TIM PM, is the principal organizational element and senior authority that identifies and manages risks, identifies and approves actions to avoid, mitigate, accept or transfer risks, and assigns responsibilities for the management of individual risks. The TIM RMB meets on a monthly basis to review and discuss risks associated with technical and management aspects of the program. The RMB ensures all program risks are assessed, captured, vetted, managed, and monitored for decision-making. It establishes and monitors the status of individual risks, approves changes to the baseline of TIM risks, and makes recommendations, when appropriate, regarding program risks to senior TSA risk management authorities for potential enterprise resolution. The roles of TIM program Risk Manager, TSA TTAC and TIM PMO managers and staff and Risk Owners were documented earlier in Section 4.3 of the Executive Summary.

B. Risk Management Approach
The process of risk management encompasses identification, analysis, mitigation planning, mitigation plan implementation, and tracking. Risk management should begin at the earliest stages of program planning and continue throughout the total life-cycle of the program. Additionally, risk management is most effective if it is fully integrated with the program's systems engineering and program management processes, as a driver and a dependency on those processes for root cause and consequence management. A risk is the potential event or future situation that may adversely affect the program. The characteristic uncertainty of a risk distinguishes it from an issue. In other words, risks address potential problems and issues address known problems. The components of a risk are the possible event itself, the probability (likelihood) that the event will occur, and the impact of the event (significance). Program risks are risks to the cost, schedule, and deliverables that are significant to warrant program-level attention. The program risk management approach addresses identification and management of program risks. This involves a continuing focus on identifying and analyzing program risks, and once identified, taking steps to mitigate their impact. The program risk management process is comprised of the following steps: (1) risk identification, (2) quantification/classification, (3) risk analysis, (4) risk handling, and (5) risk reporting. One significant requirement for the development of a unified, modular, and maintainable architecture is the reduction of the cost, risk, and time associated with implementing new capabilities, on-boarding new populations by improving the systems architecture, and on-going operations and maintenance. In order to ensure all associated risks are captured, assessed, vetted, managed, and monitored for resolution, a formal risk management process will be implemented. This design will rely on resources to establish, train, operate and maintain a viable risk management regiment in order to mitigate the impact of risk born threat while also identifying opportunistic events or process improvements to the organization. These services will be carried out by everyone and filtered through a RMB of Review headed by a Risk Manager. The RMB will be committed to addressing the management of program-level risks proactively and consistently throughout the life cycle of the program and is the driving force behind risk management. Members of the board work together to identify program-level risks submitted by the various team members the risks are then assessed and prioritized. The RMB examines the risks in order to make decisions on handling options, establish and implement mitigation plans, and monitor the risk response plans to ensure program cost, scope, and schedule are not adversely impacted. Operational risk elements can be found in a broad array of the day to day challenges surrounding the operations of TTAC systems. In order to both identify risks and tracking them the TIM risk management team will adopt tools, like Web-based risk management software, that supports the

identification, prioritization, and management of project risks. The ideal tool design should be able to capture, analyze, and display risks at a project or enterprise level so that all of the technical and non technical personnel who support or use the risk management process for their IT components are able to utilize the information. Risks have been developed at the initial, program-wide level. The RMP provides the basis for a continuous loop of input and methods for identifying, quantifying, classifying, analyzing, handling, and reporting risk in the TIM Program. New risks are always being identified and known risks are continuously being evaluated by the TIM PMO. All risks are evaluated as they are identified, analyzed, and prioritized with accompanying mitigation strategies and captured on a risk log. Senior managers, who are responsible for product deliverables, participate in this process. Appropriate actions are taken when triggers that impact the identified risk are not met. The triggers selected are continuously monitored to evaluate the effectiveness of operation. Other triggers will be assigned and monitored as they are identified.

C. Risk Assessment
The TIM risk management process entails planning, assessment and resolution phases where risks are identified and prioritized, and mitigation strategies are developed and monitored. All risk assessment data is captured in the RiskNav risk management tool. The TIM PMO uses the tool to track all managed risk, from initial identification through mitigation, and facilitates dynamic, pro-active risk assessment by allowing visual, graphic depiction of specific program risks and their overall impact, timeframe consequence, and relative priority. C.1 Risk Identification The purpose of risk identification is to name and describe the specific risks faced in this project, and to be able to analyze those risks and decide on approaches to handle risks. The person who identifies a risk is considered the risk initiator. The risk owner leads the identified risk through the risk management process or supports the process as led by the RMB. Risks are initially identified through the use of the TIM Risk Proposal Sheet provided in Appendix B. Each risk is analyzed for cost, schedule, and/or performance impacts that might require additional staff, cause a schedule delay, or require a performance change to the program based upon the measures proposed by the risk owner and the chosen handling strategy. A common misconception, and program office practice, concerning risk management is to identify and track issues (vice risks), and then manage the consequences (vice the root causes). This practice tends to mask true risks, and it serves to track rather than resolve or mitigate risks. Another common mistake is to miss label occurrences with a probability of 1.0 or 100% as risks rather than an issue. The fact that a battery will eventually fail does necessarily warrant identification as risk rather it should be identified as an issue that will need periodic addressing. The miss labeling of issues as risks can easily overwhelm any risk management plan. Risk analysis is the process in which risks are examined in detail and qualified/quantified. The purpose is to classify the risk, determine its probability of occurrence, the extent of its potential impact to the TIM Program, and controllability. Each of these factors helps determine a relative priority for each risk. The steps of the risk analysis process are outlined below: Risk Classification (What does the risk affect?) Classifying risks requires grouping risks according to their shared characteristics. These groups, which can also be called classes or sets, show the relationships between the risks. Risk classification also helps identify duplicate risks and can help simplify a list of risks.

Risk Probability (How probable is the risk?)

Risk Probability is the likelihood that this risk will occur. This aspect of a risk can be quantified to some degree by using a set of standard questions to guide the probability analysis. The probability thresholds are classified as low (L), medium (M) and high (h) in relation to the likelihood the event will occur. As mentioned above, identification of risks started early in the life cycle of the program with an initial set of risks identified in the program definition phase. Additional risk identification occurs based upon information gathered at many different events as well as on an ad hoc basis. Some of the events are:          C.2 Weekly Program Execution Status meetings Contract Amendments Addition of new phases to the project Key events or milestones Key changes in business objectives of the contract Key technical changes such as new technology or unavailability of a specific technology A change in the major stakeholders Environmental or political changes Quality Assurance reviews, audits, self-assessments, controls reviews, incident reports Risk Quantification and Classification

The probability and consequences criteria are further reviewed using the following rating charts to identify priority program risks. Although probability and consequences are evaluated in the Risk Quantification and Classification phase, in the Risk Analysis phase the sensitivity of the ratings is updated. Each risk falls into one of 5 levels for each in the Risk Analysis phase, plus the combined evaluation of probability and consequence as shown in Table C.1 Summary of Probability Ratings.

Rating 5 4 3 2 1

Probability of Negative Outcome Near Certainty (90% probability) High Probability (70% probability) Probable (50% probability) Low Probability (Unlikely - 30% probability) Not Likely (10% probability) Table C1. Summary of Probability Ratings

In addition, risks are given a consequence rating based on the severity of a negative outcome as summarized in Table C.2, Summary of Consequences.

Rating

Consequence of Negative Outcome

5 4 3 2 1

Unacceptable--Significant project disruption or inability to meet minimum performance goals Acceptable, no margin--Significant nation-wide impact on major processes or major reduction in performance goals Acceptable with significant reduction in margin--Containable financial impact and serious project impact Acceptable with small reduction in margin--Containable financial impact and containable project impact Minimal--Minimal project disruption or slippage Table C2. Summary of Consequences

The above two ratings are combined to determine overall assessment rating (which addresses risk exposure) which is used for determining risk to the program's success. Table C.3 Summary of Overall Ratings, depicts how the overall ratings are derived.

Overall Assessment Rating 5 Unacceptable Impact 4 Acceptable, no margin 0.50 0.40 0.30 1.50 1.20 0.90 2.50 2.00 1.50 3.50 2.80 2.10 4.50 3.60 2.70

Probability of Occurrence Table C. 3. Summary of Overall Ratings The combination of ratings provides an increased sensitivity to the significance of the risk. These values can be used to assign risk to categories based on the following assessment rating:    High Impact - Overall assessment rating of 2.5 or higher Moderate Impact - Overall assessment rating greater than 0.9 and less than 2.5 Low Impact - Overall assessment rating less than or equal to 0.9.

D. Risk Analysis
D.1 Risk Analysis Approach The purpose of risk analysis is to determine the potential risk exposure for each identified risk item. Risk analysis requires judgment of the risk management team to determine where to focus resources. While the initial risk analysis deals with those risks identified early in the project, more analysis is required as the project moves forward. When a new risk is identified and classified, the new risk analysis includes its exposure compared to those risks that are already assessed. Output from the risk analysis phase provides additional information for populating the risk watch list. Some level of analysis occurs during the Risk Quantification and Classification phase on the likelihood that a risk will occur, and the consequences or impact if the risk occurs. During the Risk Analysis phase, the overall ranking of risks is filtered to sort by significance. The analysis phase considers the risk exposure, a more rigorous analysis of exposure, using applicable tools. The risk probability and risk consequence rating charts, along with their combined results, as noted below are examples of applying a more robust analysis than that initiated during the quantification and classification phase (where analysis considers stand-alone results of probability and consequence separately). Analysis of risks involves:     Estimating the risk probability or likelihood that a risk will occur Estimating the consequences or significance of a risk, should it occur Estimating the frequency of repeated risks Prioritizing risks to determine the order in which they require attention.

The product of the likelihood that a risk will occur and the magnitude of the consequence of its occurrence is referred to as the risk exposure. In most instances, attacking the most significant risk items will maximize project opportunity. The risk assessment analysis captures all aspects of risk management at the program level and those aspects common to all risks. Risks categorized as having moderate-to-high impact to the success of the program are captured in a risk log spreadsheet and are categorized based on the 19 areas identified in OMB Circular A-11, Section 300-18. In addition, significant risks (moderateto-high impact) have an action plan to facilitate avoidance, control, assumption or transfer of risk. Overall assessments are modified over time to realign with changing business environment. The most critical risks to the program are captured in a program risk watch list. Also identified in this phase are the costs necessary for the implementation of the mitigation strategy. These costs will be added to the project budget as contingency funds. The TIM Program will identify, analyze, categorize, manage and monitor risks through a continuous five-part cycle of identification, analysis, planning, tracking, and controlling. Various methods and tools will be used to identify risks including risk assessment worksheets, interviews, meetings and investigation of unresolved issue escalations. TIM will

use qualitative risk analysis to assess the probability, immediacy, and potential impact of risk events. Each risk will be assigned a relative probability and impact rating. This will help determine which risks will have the most significant impact on TIM, and therefore will be managed and monitored closely. Risk owners will be assigned, and risk avoidance, deflection and mitigation strategies will be developed and implemented. This information will be maintained in the TIM Risk Management Inventory which will be updated regularly. The activities of the risk management cycle are outlined below: Step 1: Identify: Determine which risks may negatively affect the program and determine their characteristics. Although risk identification is the first step in the cycle, it is a constant process and risks will continue to be identified throughout the life of the program. Step 2: Analyze: Assess the impact, probability, immediacy, and the controllability of each risk. Risks will be prioritized according to their potential effect on program objectives. Step 3: Plan: Develop options and determine actions to reduce negative impacts on program objectives. The PM will assign members of the project team and associated organizations, responsibility for risk responses. Step 4: Track: Monitor the status of risks and determine if risk triggers have occurred. Identify new risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of risk responses. Key source will be weekly team meetings and status reports, as they will reveal any issues that will affect the program. Step 5: Control: Execute risk responses and correct for deviations from planned risk actions through corrective action and contingency planning. Approved risks are further documented in RiskNav. RiskNav is a risk management tool that provides a single graphical representation of risk priority/consequence, probability, and the status of the ongoing mitigation efforts. This risk management tool helps the TIM PM and chairperson of the RMB, to keep the program on track by ensuring that risks are identified and managed so the program is delivered within cost, on time and meeting the performance needs in of the users. In order to review risks, the RMB meets regularly with the Risk Manager and risks are also reviewed at the senior leadership and technical meetings. TIM program risks are managed within the program using available resources (funding, personnel, and materials) when feasible. External (non-TIM program related), cross-program dependencies and risks are reported to Enterprise management for appropriate allocation and mitigation. Progress on identified risks and their risk mitigation strategies are monitored o a regular basis and reported at periodic TIM Program reviews. D.2 Risk Analysis and Management Products The products used to facilitate the risk management process include:   A taxonomy for identifying the potential risks A risk area worksheet for capturing and categorizing risks

   

A risk planning worksheet for evaluating and developing mitigation plans A quantification matrix for determining risk exposure and ranking the risks A risk watch list of the highest priority risks A risk action status report that will be part of the regular status reporting process.

The purpose of having a regular risk reporting process is to ensure that mitigation efforts are applied to risks and keep the risks under control. In addition, monitoring of indicators occurs so that contingency plans can be initiated when necessary. Throughout the program, TIM RMB administers risk tracking and control. The RMP describes the risk threshold (e.g., cost of mitigation as percent of cost for task or contract, schedule thresholds as a deviation from projected schedule milestones, etc.). Data related to individual risks are collected, compiled and analyzed to determine actions to be taken. Risk tracking and control includes:       Collecting tracking data related to risks Analyzing data related to individual risks Analyzing aggregate risk data Proposing risk response actions based on risk data Communicating risk status to the TIM PMO and TTAC Program Management Maintaining the Risk Description Document and the Risk Response Plan (Risk Management Inventory).

These activities occur so that the effectiveness of actions taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and those taken to reduce the loss associated with a risk can be assessed. The principal tool to be used for TIM risk management is the automated tool RiskNav, a webbased tool designed to document and track risks. RiskNav allows the user to view information online or to print reports for risks that have been entered for active projects. The tool facilitates structured risk collection, structured analysis and a common definition of terms including cost, schedule, technical performance, and oversight as well as compliance impact ratings. Using formatted screens, users enter information about risks, assign risk categories, and document their analyses and justifications, estimate potential impacts, determine probabilities, establish priorities, and document the strategy that is planned for the risk. The TIM Risk Manager, who is responsible for establishing the necessary permissions for personnel to use this tool on their workstations, will arrange for the TIM Manager and other selected personnel to have access to this application. The Risk manager will also provide the necessary instruction and training in the use of the tool. An additional tool that may be used by the TIM program is the TIM Risk Management Wiki site. This site will permit the exchange, collection and collaboration of risk-related information among TIM team personnel and enhance the flow of information among team members.

E. Risk Handling
The purpose of risk handling is to plan a set of actions to reduce exposure and to achieve success. This effort requires that risks have been defined, using the Risk Definition Template, and prioritized on the risk log. Risks may be addressed in a number of different ways. The output from risk handling is that all key risks are addressed with actions and/or contingency plans, which are justifiable (cost-based) against the benefits to the project. Risk handling is the function of deciding what, if anything should be done with a risk and answers the following questions:    Who should own the risk? What actions and plans should be put in place to handle the risk? What resources need to be committed to mitigation?

Focusing on the prioritized events from Risk Analysis, the risk management team identifies the approach to handle risks and estimates the cost or effort required for those actions. For instance, appropriate allocation of resources becomes critical to risk mitigation. Expenditures would be very closely monitored to assure that funds and resources are directly contributing towards risk mitigation. As resources are allocated, the risk priority may change. As part of this effort, the risk management team will determine the appropriate risk response:  Avoidance - Use an alternate approach that does not have the risk. This mode is not always an option. There are programs that deliberately involve high risks in the expectation of high gains. However, this is the most effective risk management technique if it can be applied. Mitigation - Controlling risks through mitigation involves the development of a risk reduction plan and then tracking to the plan. The key aspect is the planning by experienced persons. The plan itself may involve parallel development programs, etc. Acceptance - Also known as Monitor in the risk management tool, this is a conscious decision to accept the consequences should the event occur. A contingency plan should be developed. Risk Transfer - Transferring risks attempts to pass the risk to another program element. Typically, used in the context of a government agency passing the risks to a contractor. There are some discussions in the DoD acquisition literature that this mode trades government risk for profit to the contractor.

  

The risk management inventory will be updated to reflect how each of the risks will be handled and will be re-evaluated on a monthly basis. A standardized Risk Definition template will be used that captures risk identification, risk description, impacts on cost, schedule, quality, and performance metrics, summary of the RMP for a particular risk, and re-assessment history. E.1 Risk Management Process Phases

The diagram in Figure E.1. Overview of Risk Management Process depicts the various activities and functions in the risk management process. The flow of risk management activities is included the following paragraphs. The risk-planning phase includes the development of this risk management plan. The plan defines and documents a comprehensive and iterative risk management approach that describes activities to assess, schedule, handle, monitor, and document risk in accordance with applicable standards. This planning phase also includes implementation of the risk management plan, which allocates the necessary resources and tasks individuals who are responsible for executing the RM processes. Orientation and training of members of the project team may also be conducted during this phase, when necessary. The risk assessment phase includes risk identification and documentation as its first steps. Everyone in the TIM's Program participates in risk identification by paying attention, thinking about what could happen if something went wrong, and not assuming that everything will go as planned. One way to identify risks is by periodically answering the question, What could cause an unwanted impact to the TIM program's cost, schedule or technical performance? TIM personnel, when identifying a risk, will complete a Risk Proposal sheet, attached as an Enclosure. The next step, risk analysis, includes an assessment of potential impacts of the risk and an identification of possible adverse consequences. The potential risk is then prioritized for action considering the risk's probability, severity, impact date of the risk occurrence, and overall consequence. With some exceptions, the order in which most risks are worked is based upon priority. The risk that is most likely to occur within a short timeframe and with the greatest impact is likely to get the most attention and possible funding. Several tools exist to be used by the program to assign and document timeframe, probability and level of impact. Also in this assessment phase the risk is assigned to a category based on the source or cause of the risk (e.g., technical, schedule, funding, integration, security, performance, staffing/resources, and acquisition.). Grouping risks into categories helps to focus on the source of the risk and helps in the consistent handling of risks in the same category. Finally in this phase, a risk strategy is developed, which includes evaluating and selecting the appropriate risk handling options for each risk. This process includes documenting the steps that will be taken to mitigate the risk or accept it, and schedule start/stop dates in the Risk Status Form, attached as an Enclosure. Developing the risk strategy includes establishing risk metrics, and developing cost, schedule, and technical impacts for the selected risk handling option. The risk resolution phase includes risk handling and the monitoring and evaluation of the progress made in managing the risk. This phase includes the following:  Reviewing the risk strategy for the selected risk  Establishing accountability and making resource available for the strategy's execution, maintenance, data collection, and monitoring  Ensuring that risk mitigation efforts are in concert with decisions of the TIM Configuration Control Board (CCB) and Engineering Review Board (ERB).

   

Measuring progress using defined risk handling metrics Periodically reviewing and documenting the status of all risks and associated metrics Periodically re-evaluating the effectiveness of existing risk handling options and strategies and determining actions (e.g., close the risk, re-plan, and prepare a contingency plan or continue as is) based on the current risk status.

E.2 Opportunity Management The TIM PMO will manage potential opportunities, proactively, in parallel with potential risks by utilizing much of the model outlined below that comprises the TIM Risk management Process while risks are measured and reported in terms of their likelihood of occurrence and potential benefits. The TIM Risk Management Board shall also operate to manage opportunities and will make determinations to exploit, share, enhance, or accept an opportunity based on input from the opportunity originator and the team on which the originator resides for the management of opportunities will be the same as those listed below for the management of risks. Through the use of the uniform approach, tradeoffs between risks and opportunities will become more easily identifiable. Opportunities, if understood and managed within the overall risk management program, could improve the likelihood of achieving program goals, through more effective tradeoffs of cost, schedule, and technical performance. Similar to risks, opportunities will be clearly identified, documented, vetted through the proper channels, and assessed in terms of likelihood and impacts of benefits.

A straightforward opportunity flow diagram is shown below in Figure E.2.1. Opportunity Life Cycle Flow. The originator is to bring the opportunity to his/her Government team lead for consideration by that specific team. Should that team determine the opportunity has enough merit to be moved forward, the government team lead brings it to the TIM Risk Manager for presentation to the TIM FMB with his/her assessment of the opportunity's benefit, associated risk, cost, etc. The TIM RMB will apply a status to the opportunity and assign an owner of that opportunity if the decision is made to manage that opportunity. The owner will implement the opportunity and regularly report its progress to the TIM RMB.

Opportunity Strategies

The opportunity strategies are handled as follows:     Exploit: This strategy is pursued if the program wants to ensure that the opportunity is adopted and the full benefit of the opportunity is obtained. Share: This strategy shifts the ownership of the opportunity to another group within the organization or to an external source. The rationale is that the other party is better suited to reap the benefit of achieving the opportunity than the program itself. Enhance: This strategy modifies the size of an opportunity by increasing its probability and/or positive impacts and by identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positiveimpact risks. Accept: This strategy provides for living with the reality that the opportunity is likely to happen which then entails putting in place plans to take advantage of it when it actually occurs.

Typically, only risks with extremely low potential impact and/or probability of occurrence will rate an "Acceptance" response (i.e., "acknowledge the risk, but take no steps to reduce its potential consequences or probability of occurrence). All others will be dealt with in one or more ways as listed above.

F. Summary
The TSA PMO has recognized the need to take a proactive approach in the management of risks related to TIM Program. Consequently, the management of risks for this project follows a continuous risk management model to ensure that all risks are identified, managed and mitigated to facilitate program success with a minimal impact to cost, schedule and performance goals. A risk event and risk category classification table is shown below as a sample that can be adopted.

Introduction

The Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC) Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) Program has tailored the DHS System Engineering Life Cycle (SELC) to make it consistent with the project needs and to address unique project variations based on programmatic requirements, application domains, solution approaches, and tradeoffs in cost, schedule, and quality. The intent of the TIM Program Tailoring Plan is to define the optimal development methodology that provides the program the best opportunity for successful delivery and that meets all of the required standards for reviews. This tailoring plan will be updated upon completion of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and during each phase of the SELC. 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the TIM Program Tailoring Plan is to define the specific life cycle stages and artifacts that the program will complete. 2. SELC Project Tailoring The DHS SELC Guide specifies standards to manage the development of IT projects. The Guide recognizes that there are multiple ways to approach and accomplish the required work. The Program Manager (PM) is tailoring the DHS SELC to guide the project to successful completion. The TIM PM will follow the DHS SELC Guide 2.0 with intent to complete all required documentation and stage reviews. A Program Management Plan (PMP) and Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) was developed for the program. Some security documentation was tailored out of the planning phase to be completed during later stages in the SELC. Included in this tailoring plan are those documents that will be completed or tailored out for the solutions engineering and planning stages. 2.1 Project Overview

This section describes the key characteristics of the TIM Program that influence the program tailoring as follows: 2.1.1 Project Summary The mission of the DHS is to lead the unified national effort to secure America. DHS will prevent and deter terrorist attacks and protect against and respond to threats and hazards to the Nation. DHS will also secure our national borders while welcoming lawful immigrants, visitors, and trade. The mission of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is to protect the Nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. To support the missions of both DHS and TSA, TSA's Office of Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC) was established.

1

TTAC's mission is to reduce the probability of a successful terrorist or other criminal attack to the transportation system through application of the threat assessment methodologies that are intended to identify known or suspected terrorist threats working or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system. TTAC serves as the lead for all security threat assessments and credentialing initiatives for transportation industry workers, and individuals seeking access to our nations critical infrastructure. Current TTAC enrollment, ID management, vetting, adjudication, investigations, redress, and credentialing infrastructure and services were created to support and monitor 2.5 million individuals per year. Today, the populations supported by TTAC have more than quintupled to 12.5 million individuals per year while operating resources have not kept pace. Serviced populations are expected to grow to 20 million individuals within the next 2 years, with a projected 40-50 million increase within the next five years, as the demand for TTAC population screening services continues to grow. As a result, TTAC must modernize its current infrastructure to meet the mission capabilities as linked to 2010 DHS and TSA mission drivers, and scale to meet mission needs of current and future populations. Further, it is anticipated that over the next five years, existing stove-piped business processes and information systems will either be reengineered or replaced by new integrated business and technical enterprise architectures that will:       Consolidate multiple enrollment methods Implement identity management services across programs Standardize the approach for customer relationship management Standardize the physical and virtual credentialing processes Standardize threat assessment processes Consolidate operations by integrating program-specific information technology (IT) systems and business processes into a common secure enterprise vetting and credentialing architecture.

To address these concerns, TSA created the TIM Program to modernize the way it does business followed by the creation of the TIM Program Management Office (TIM PMO) to manage the Program. 2.1.2 Project Scope The TIM Program estimates total cost of $571 Million from 2009 through 2018. The current Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE) was updated from the original estimates and will be updated again as part of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). Funding is anticipated to come from both appropriated dollars and Universal Fee revenue sources. It is anticipated that within the first five years of the TIM Program, existing stove-piped business processes and information systems will either be reengineered or replaced by a new integrated business enterprise architecture that will consolidate multiple enrollment methods, implement identity management services across programs, standardize the approach for customer relationship management, standardize the physical and virtual credentialing processes, standardize threat assessment processes, and
2

consolidate operations by integrating program-specific IT systems and business processes into a common secure enterprise vetting and credentialing system. 2.1.3 Project Size / Expected Project Duration The TIM Program is expected to be a Level 2 investment due to its importance to DHS strategic plans and an acquisition estimate(s) of $571 million over the next 10 years (pending development and approval of the AoA and LCCE). The incremental development approach will achieve modernization objectives and mitigate implementation risks, while improving TTAC's program performance over a 10 year lifecycle. 2.1.4 Project Complexity The TIM Program will use an incremental implementation strategy to reduce overall risk and disruption to the existing systems. The complexity of an organization comprised of seven distinct programs providing services to differing populations serviced by government and industry partners creates challenges including installation, design and development of new systems, integrations of those systems, deployment testing, migration strategy of running legacy and new systems simultaneously, end user training and equipment decommissioning activities. This moderate complexity is addressed in the TIM Risk Management Plan which provides the strategy to mitigate these implementation risks. 2.1.5 Proposed technology and its maturity The TIM program will deliver a consolidated and integrated secure transportation vetting and credentialing services IT architecture that will enhance transportation security, effectively meet current and future populations and provide efficient customer service on robust, scalable, and flexible technology. The TIM architecture utilizes the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Service Component-Based Architectures that will be illustrated with completion of the AoA. The technical architecture will be further decomposed as the preferred solution is determined in the AoA. The TIM architecture will meet the TTAC mission with more effective and efficient integrated systems balancing cost reduction with enhanced performance and provides for the incremental design and development of the TIM system by capability and will replace, rebuild, and/or reuse current legacy systems based on the results of an AoA. The TIM Program acquisition includes operations, technologies, and/or activities that interface with other DHS components. TIM will capitalize on significant economies of scale by consolidating business drivers/processes and by implementing integrated and flexible technical architectures creating state-of-the-art vetting and credentialing services. The transition of legacy systems will occur in increments. The method and foundation of this transformation plan will be in the TIM AoA.

3

2.1.6 Delivery organization(s) (e.g., internal, name of contractor) The TIM PMO, in conjunction with the Office of Acquisition (OA), is responsible for managing the design, development and implementation of the TIM System through Full Operating Capability (FOC). The Operational Test Agent (OTA) appointment will be coordinated and approved by DHS Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E). The TIM Test and Evaluation Management Plan (TEMP) provides further details on the OTA. Throughout the system development lifecycle, organizations such as the CIO and OA at the TSA and DHS level will be called upon to participate in the review and approval process of different life cycle phases. The TIM Program Management staff is responsible for managing the contracts under the program. The TIM Program existing and planned contracts include but are not limited to:         PMO Support Analysis of Alternatives Business Architecture Support Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Support OTA Support Biometric Credentialing Support Development Hardware/Software Design and Develop TIM

Additional information on TIM resource planning and program management structure can be found in TIM Program Management Plan (PMP). 2.1.7 Organizational Impact The mission of the TIM Program is to align and integrate current TTAC processes, services, and infrastructure through the development of an integrated system to more effectively and efficiently meet the TTAC mission and provide increased capability to accommodate future transportation sector populations. The TIM Program supports DHS and TSA's mission, by significantly improving the vetting and credentialing management and adjudication platform currently used for conducting security threat assessments (STAs) on various transportation populations through the consolidation of legacy services, and through the use of software applications, and a common IT infrastructure that includes consolidated knowledge based database architecture. The TIM Program presents an opportunity to eliminate redundant business practices, processes, and subsequent IT investments to achieve significant economies of scale associated with a unifying business integration effort.

4

The TIM Program will interface operations, technologies, and other associated activities to DHS services including the Screening Coordination Office (SCO), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), US Visitor and Immigration Status Indictor Technology (USVISIT), US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), TSA Secure Flight and others as appropriate. The TIM Program will also interface with other Federal agencies as appropriate, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) and US Federal critical infrastructure. The TIM Program's goals and objectives are aligned with the overall strategic plans of DHS and its strategic goals including innovative use of analytical and detection technologies and techniques to collect and manage transportation population information regarding potential threats to persons, cargo, and commerce, and to share security and intelligence information to customers in a timely and efficient manner. Further, the TIM Program will support Vetting & Credentialing programs across the Department securing critical transportation infrastructure. The development of the TIM System will result in an integrated, end-to-end solution to manage the identities, credentials, and security threat assessment results for millions of transportation sector workers as well as critical infrastructure. The TIM system will reflect and leverage lessons learned from years of managing a diverse portfolio of screening programs. 2.1.8 Project Delivery Methodology The TIM Program will use a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach for the newly designed system. The details of this approach are noted below in the TIM Master Objective and Threshold Schedule. Three task orders, at a minimum will be used to build the new system. The first task order will build the TIM foundation architecture. The foundation architecture will include all systems/subsystems required to support the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) capability for security threat assessments and credentialing. It will include the purchase and installation of all hardware, software, applications, and databases. Other work included in this task order will include specifications for a universal enrollment workstation as well as operations and maintenance of TIM and current TWIC systems. Another task order will include design and development of any special requirements required to support surface populations such as Hazardous Materials Endorsement and others; followed by an additional task order for aviation and a final/optional task order for all other populations and/or work required. Existing systems will be transitioned to the new system when the capability to support it is complete. The program intends to use an Indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to deliver the services required.

Executive Summary
The purpose of this Configuration Management (CM) document is to define the CM processes to be used in support of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and Transportation Threat Assessment Credentialing Infrastructure Modernization Program (TIM). CM is applied to all TIM Program hardware, software, firmware, and documentation, regardless of whether it is contractor developed, Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Government furnished. The desired result of applying CM activities to the TIM Program is the delivery of a complete and fully verifiable and traceable system to the end user. This process provides for the establishment and administration of the Technical Review Board (TRB), Change control board (CCB) and the Executive Review Board (ERB). It identifies the flow of change actions related to TIM, Development & Test (D&T), Operations and Maintenance (O&M), and system documentation. It also describes the responsibilities for the TRB, CCB, and the ERB and defines the methodology for controlling, implementing and managing changes to established TIM Program baselines. The Configuration Management organization is responsible for supporting the TRB, CCB and ERB. All potentially affected organizations are responsible for assessing impacts resulting from proposed changes and presenting them to the applicable board. The TIM program and all supporting contractor organizations use this change management process to ensure that system and technical documentation changes are implemented in a consistent manner, and that the appropriate stakeholders are aware of the content of each change and any schedule impacts.

Introduction

Configuration Management (CM) is the discipline of managing the evolution of a Configuration Item (CI) by identifying, documenting, controlling, and auditing the item. The objective of CM is to establish and maintain the integrity of CIs by applying procedures for configuration identification, configuration control, configuration status accounting, and configuration audits. This CM plan defines uniform practices for managing identified CIs. The plan describes the practices to be followed throughout the life cycle of CIs to ensure that changes to CIs are controlled, monitored, and recorded, and that the integrity of all items are maintained. 1.1 Purpose

This CM plan addresses the goal of creating a managed CM process. The purpose of this document is to identify the requirements, standards, and practices that will be applied to configuration management and control for all identified CIs at program and project levels.

2. Organizational Structure
The TIM Program maintains baseline integrity throughout the life cycle of the program, through the use of the TRB, CCB and ERB structures. As shown in Figure 1, these organizations are structured in a hierarchical manner to facilitate assessment, approval and implementation decisions. The change management process begins when the TRB considers proposed changes for merit and assesses whether they are ready to proceed for further processing at the CCB. The TRB reviews CR/PR content and impact assessments to ensure that the change is ready for CCB disposition. The TRB meets weekly or as needed to review and disposition proposed changes. Board members review the CRs/PRs for cost and/or schedule impact for their representative organizations. Cost impact is defined as the cost in both dollars and labor hours above the baseline budget for the organization. Schedule and cost savings are also reported. All CRs/PRs must first receive TRB approval for continued processing. Impact assessments must be completed by all functional areas, prior to the change being reviewed by a change review board. Also, review boards may be conducted electronically or as a walk-through, depending on the nature and/or urgency of the change. The TRB/CCB may also meet jointly if appropriate. Full-time participants in the review board process are identified by TSA TIM Program Office with other attendees and CR/PR sponsors designated as necessary to support CR/PR presentation and discussion. TSA Program Management chairs the TRB, CCB and the ERB.

Figure 1 - Change Control Board Hierarchy and Overview Technical Review Board (TRB)
The TRB is chartered to consider proposed changes to ensure that they all technical options have been reviewed and an impact assessment has been properly completed, and that they are sufficiently complete to enter the CCB review process. The TRB controls COTS baselines and all changes to the Engineering database. The TRB is chaired by the Systems Engineer/Chief Architect or designee, who has the authority to disposition a CR/PR for continued processing. Each TRB member has the responsibility to review CR/PR s for technical content, cost and schedule impacts, risk assessment, alternative solutions, implementation decision, contractual issues and potential impacts to other subsystems. In addition, each board member has full authority and responsibility for representing their functional area on issues or actions relevant to the change being presented. The CR/PR sponsor is required to attend the TRB to present the CR/PR and answer any questions which may arise. TRB assigned action items are either tracked to closure before the CR/PR is authorized to proceed in the change process, or they are made a part of the change itself and processed for closure with the implementation verification process. The board makes recommendations for approved changes being presented for CCB consideration. TRB disapproved CR/PR s are returned to the initiator for rescheduling, rework as necessary to support further consideration, or cancellation.

Change Control Board (CCB)
The CCB is subordinate to the ERB and is chartered to consider and disposition changes having program baseline impacts, The CCB is chaired by TSA TIM Program Management who has the authority to disposition a CR/PR and determine whether it can be implemented or will require presentation to the ERB. CCB membership consists of TSA TIM Program Office and supporting contractor personnel. Each CCB member has the responsibility to review CR/PR s for technical content, cost and schedule impacts, risk assessment, alternative solutions, implementation decision, and contract issues, potential impacts to other subsystems, and sub-contractor comments or quotes when applicable. In addition, each board member has full authority and responsibility for representing their functional area on issues or actions relevant to the change being presented. The CR/PR sponsor is required to attend the CCB and present the CR/PR and answer any questions which may arise. See Table 3 for CCB membership. CCB assigned action items are either tracked to closure before the CR/PR is authorized to proceed in the change process, or they are made a part of the change itself and processed for closure with the implementation verification process. The board makes recommendations for approved changes that are forwarded for ERB consideration. CCB disapproved CR/PR s are returned to the initiator for rescheduling, rework as necessary to support further consideration, or cancellation.

Executive Review Board (ERB)
The ERB is the final review authority for TIM Program CR/PRs found to have significant out-of-scope contract and/or SOW content impacts. TSA management is responsible for the administration of the ERB, to include the scheduling of meetings, and the preparation of agendas and minutes. The ERB chair has the authority to disposition any CR/PR presented for consideration. ERB membership consists of the TSA TIM PMO and supporting contractor personnel and performs its function as a senior TSA TIM review board. Each ERB member or delegate has the responsibility to review change requests for technical content, cost and schedule impacts, risk assessment, alternative solutions, implementation decision, contract issues, and any impacts to other subsystems. In addition, each board member has full authority and responsibility for representing their functional area concerning issues or actions relevant to the change being presented. See Table 5 for CCB Membership. CCB assigned action items are either tracked to closure before the CR/PR is authorized to proceed in the change process, or they are made a part of the change itself and processed for closure with the implementation verification process CR/PR s must have all funding impacts identified before being presented for final ERB review. CR/PR s lacking this information is placed on "ERB Hold Pending Funding" until the information is provided.

Operation Change Control Board (OCCB) The Operation Configuration Control Board (OCCB) is where all changes are submitted and is the final decision authority and grants approval to proceed with implementation (deployment) to the Production environment. TIM OCCB memberships shall consist of members of the TIM PMO, TSA TIM Operations and TIM contractor staff. 2.1 System Interdependencies

System Interdependencies for the TIM program would include SAVE (Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements), FBI NCIC (National Crime Information Center), FBI AFIS (Automated Fingerprint Identification System), US-VISIT IDENT (Automated Biometric Identification System), and CSOC Vetting Operations. 2.2 Staff Roles and Responsibilities

The CM analyst, Program Manager and project team jointly establish the overall planning, implementation and monitoring of CM activities. CM performs certain activities to accomplish the following: Develop project-specific CM plan (CMP) or TIM CM On-boarding template Participate in the Technical Review Board (TRB), Change control board (CCB). Ensure change requests are properly prepared, authorized and ready for CCB. Perform Configuration Management Library (CML) functions to include control of documents, software and hardware. 5. Perform release and control functions as follows: a. Establish source code baselines and generate controlled output (e.g., object, executables) b. Coordinate and control all changes to baseline code c. Maintain physical control of baseline software media masters and hardware drawings. d. Deliver software for system and functional/acceptance testing and release to the production. e. Serve as central release point for baseline documentation. f.

3. Configuration Identification
Configuration identification consists of selecting the CIs, defining the items by assigning unique identifiers according to established naming conventions, and documenting their physical and functional characteristics. Configuration identification provides current, complete, accurate, and available information about CIs during all stages of design, development, and deployment. 3.1 Configuration Item Selection

The contractor shall select and recommend potential CIs to TSA. Any item requiring logistics support and designated for separate procurement is a CI. However, all CIs associated with any given development program are not necessarily designated as CIs at the same point in time. Computer hardware will be treated as CIs. Computer software will be treated as CSCIs throughout the life of the program regardless of how the software will be stored. The final CI selection will be made by TSA. 3.2 Configuration Item Characteristics

The unique characteristics of each CI must either be documented or automatically identified by the configuration management system. These characteristics include:  Document o Unique identifier o Baseline identifier o Version o Author/owner o Title o Program/project reference(s) o Business area reference(s) o File type o Document type o Contract reference(s) o Dates (entered, updated, archived, etc.) Software o Unique identifier o Baseline identifier o Version o Relationship (how used, dependency) o Author/owner o File type o Programming language o Dates (entered, updated, archived, etc.) Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Software o Unique identifier o Name of software

3.3

Items under configuration control should conform to standard nomenclature. While each project conforms to the DHS SDLC, each of these projects may tailor the SDLC to their specific needs. Therefore, the volume and complexity of each projects CI set differs from one project to the next. Each project is encouraged to develop specific nomenclature standards applicable to that project. These standards should adhere to a set of guidelines for naming CIs. The following guidelines apply to items stored in a repository tool. Projects which store items elsewhere (such as a shared drive) should tailor these guidelines to fit their situation. Nomenclature guidelines:  Item Name o Include  Division or System identifier (ex: CSPO, ACE, ACS, etc.)  Optional identifiers (module or subsystem)  Full name of the item (tool limitations may apply, see abbreviations) o Do not include  Version Number  Date  Originators or Editors name Versioning o Should be tool driven whenever possible o Captured as an attribute of the CI record o See Section 4.2.1 Abbreviations o

4. Configuration Control
Once configuration items have been identified and baselined, Configuration Control provides a system to initiate, review, approve, and implement proposed changes. Each engineering change or problem report that is initiated against a formally identified configuration item is evaluated to determine its necessity and impact. Approved changes are implemented, testing is performed to verify that the change was correctly implemented and that no unexpected side effects have occurred as a result of the change and the affected documentation is updated and reviewed. 4.1 Baseline Control

Baselines are defined and created in accordance with the CM Plan and the phase of the projects lifecycle. A baseline is a specification or product that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon, that serves as the basis for further development, and can only be changed through formal change control procedures. A baseline is like a snapshot of the aggregate of software components as they exist at a given point in time. During each phase of the software lifecycle, configuration items that are completed and accepted by the approval authority become the baseline for that phase. Any addition, alteration, or deletion to the approved baseline is deemed a change, and is subject to change control. Baselines, plus the approved changes from those baselines, constitute the current configuration identification. Each of the baselines established during a software lifecycle controls subsequent software development. 4.2 Configuration Item Control

This section shall describe the contractors procedures for meeting the requirements of configuration control. Configuration item control is the systematic proposal, justification, evaluation, coordination, approval or disapproval of proposed changes, and the implementation of all approved changes, in the configuration of a CI after establishment of the configuration baseline(s) for the CI. Configuration item control begins with the establishment of the functional baseline and continues as further configuration baselines are established for the CIs, using the Functional Configuration Audits (FCAs) and Physical Configuration Audits (PCAs) contractually invoked by TSA. Configuration item control continues throughout the life cycle of the CI. The contractor shall implement a configuration item control function that ensures regulation of the flow of proposed changes, documentation of the complete impact of the proposed changes, and release only of approved configuration changes into CIs and their related configuration documentation. Configuration item control begins with the establishment of the functional baseline and continues as further configuration baselines are established for the CIs, using the Functional Configuration Documents (FCDs), the Physical Configuration Documents (PCDs), and the Operational Configuration Documents (OCDs) contractually invoked by TSA. Configuration item control continues throughout the life cycle of the CI. The following

requirements shall apply only to the FCD, the PCDs, and the OCDs that have been approved/contractually implemented by TSA. 4.2.1 Version Control The TIM Program will utilize the capabilities of the Rational tools ex. (ClearQuest, ClearCase) for managing all CIs including CRs/PRs. The TIM program will utilize the capabilities of the Microsoft SharePoint tool (the TSA implementation of which is called iShare) to facilitate version control for all of its document configuration items. In SharePoint, CIs will be stored in highly customizable digital containers called Document Libraries. 4.2.1.1 Version Number Once a CI is uploaded into a properly configured library, the first major version is created: 1.0. After the initial upload, in order for a document to be edited, the document will need to be checked-out, which is measure SharePoint uses to eliminate duplicate edits and comments by ensuring only one user can edit a document at a time. After all document manipulation is completed, the user must check-in the document in order for other users to view the document. When minor changes are made to a CI, a minor version is created: 1.1. Each time a minor version is created, the second digit in the version shall increase by 1 until 1.9 is reached, after which the next version will be a major version: 2.0 and the process will continue. 4.2.1.2 Version History Every time a new version of a CI is created, the old version shall be automatically compressed and stored on the SharePoint server. Every version of the document is available to users with access to the document library in which the CI is stored. In order to access previous versions of a CI, the user should simply click to the right of the document title and select Version History from the menu. This will display 1) Every version ever created of the CI; 2) The user who last modified it; 3) the date of its last modification; 4) the size of the document; and 5) any comments that were provided upon check-in. 4.2.1.3 Version Traceability Every version of the CI will be available to users with access to the document library in which the CI is stored. Even minor versions will be available for viewing. This will provide for traceability from a later version to a much earlier and perhaps more minor version. 4.2.2 Repository
The TIM multimedia library is a repository for access, maintenance, and storage of all program-related media and documents generated internally and received from external sources in support of the program. The library is available to all TIM personnel. The CM organization is responsible for safeguarding the project artifacts in the CM Library The TIM program library houses various program media identified by the CM Plan. Examples include:  presentation material,

documents, letters, DVDs CDs etc  Accept data into the library that is suitable for library maintenance.  Separate all library program material by contract (if applicable), and maintain a database of library contents.  Maintain and control all document files.  Implement the refresh policy for CDs and magnetic media.  Maintain an up-to-date file and computerized record of incoming and outgoing correspondence.  Develop a retention policy for all received items, as well as an archive/destruction methodology (e.g., date, place, and method of destruction).  Confirm that the current version of all documents is readily available to users.  Duplicate media for distribution, as required.  Remove invalid or obsolete documents from use, or mark materials as "For Reference Only" or "Obsolete" to retain them as a reference.

CM librarian shall complete the following tasks when assigned:

Library contents change during the program life cycle. The following information, at a minimum, shall be maintained for each item:  Project name  Device name  Device serial number  Multi-device designation, if applicable (e.g., reel 1 or 3 reels)  Version or revision, if applicable  Date generated  Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) number, if applicable For all documentation received into the library, the CM organization issues a unique tracking number. The CM organization should store all documentation according to the tracking ID. Documentation receipt and tracking guidelines include:  A softcopy of the material or several hardcopies should be provided to the library. For hardcopy receipt, one copy is stamped with the program name followed by "Library Copy." Additional hardcopies are used for lending and/or distribution as requested or required by program direction.

484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528

 The document is entered into the proper database and filed under the appropriate contract.  All tracking numbers are assigned electronically in sequential order and recorded in a CI Issue Log.  The Inventory database is updated when loaned copies are returned. If copies are not returned as required, the library notifies the borrower with a reminder. Master copies retained by the library are never available for loan.

4.2.3 Archiving/Retiring As stated in the section above, the CM Librarian shall develop a retention policy for all CIs, including archiving and retiring/properly destroying CIs. 4.3 Change Management

The change management process aids in providing timely and efficient resolutions to stakeholder change requests. This consequently enhances the overall performance and delivery baselines for all programs. The objectives of the process are as follows:  Manage and resolve requirement change requests in a timely manner  Analyze requirement change requests for impact to stakeholders, schedule and budget  Document requirement change requests to retain a history of accepted and rejected CRs  Confirm the requirement change requests are evaluated in line with the TIM mission and goals The change management process begins with the routine submission of a technical or documentation-related change and continues through the review, approval, verification, and implementation phases, thus encompassing the entire system life cycle. Routine submissions may be entered at any time by any user and the CM Team owns all new change requests. The routine submission of a change initiates the various change control process for system development, O&M, and document-related changes.    System development change control process: utilized when a programs systemrelated change is identified by program personnel O&M change control process: version of the TIM change control process that is utilized when a hardware or software infrastructure-related change is identified by TIM personnel Document change control process: subset of the TIM change control process that is utilized when a technical or system-related change is identified by TIM personnel and impacts existing TIM technical documentation

4.3.1.1 Change Requests/Work Requests All Change Requests and Work Requests will be documented as a CR. A CR is a formally submitted artifact that represents a stakeholder request (including requests for new features,

enhancement, changed requirements, etc.) that tracks the change status or ,,state information and history, including dates, throughout the change cycle. 4.3.1.2 Requesting Changes Once it has been determined that a change should proceed for change board review, a number is assigned to the Change Request (CR) and the CR is then finalized within ClearQuest, with respect to the "Description of Change" and "Assessment" information, to permit a "stand-alone" review. Supporting documentation is attached as necessary to provide a full explanation. The process continues with the submission of a technical or documentation-related change and continues through the review, approval, verification, and implementation phases, encompassing the entire system life cycle. The automated tool ClearQuest is used to document and track each change through implementation and closure. 4.3.1.3 Analyzing Changes
All proposed changes are entered on a CR/PR and submitted for review and a course of action determination by the TRB. The TRB identifies and classifies the proposed change. There are two types of classes in which the changes are identified:  A Class I change is a major and/or significant system change, which usually impacts the contract and/or scope of work.

When a Class I change is identified, it is elevated to the TSA ERB. Class I changes, which require Contract or Engineering Change Proposals (CCP/ECP), affect functionality, performance, implementation strategy, and/or have a cost or schedule impact. Class I changes must be approved by the CCB, and as required, the ERB, and authorized by the TSA Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) prior to implementation.  Class II changes are changes to baseline software, material substitution to hardware and/or baseline documentation, which is considered to be in-scope to the contract and SOW and falls into three distinct types: o functional o environmental o documentation

Class II changes are reviewed for final disposition by the TRB/CCB.
Proposed changes are determined by the severity of the request submitted and are prioritized from levels 1 to 5.

Priority Description
1 2 3 Urgent ­ Changes generally involve correcting deficiencies that cause a project halt or unacceptable errors in the operational environment. No acceptable work-around exists. High ­ Changes generally involve correcting deficiencies that cause a project halt or unacceptable errors in the operational environment; an acceptable work-around exists. Medium ­ Changes involve correcting problems that could degrade performance or adversely impact cost or schedule.

Table 2: Priority Table
There are 3 CR/PR types that make up the TIM CR/PR Process Flow. 1. Functional ­ Any change that effects the source code, build process and/or installation process, regardless of whether or not it is checked into ClearCase (ex: scripts, configuration files, data base updates, functional code). 2. Environmental ­ Any change that does not affect the source, build process and/or installation process, regardless of whether it is checked into ClearCase (ex: Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), patches, Sys admin scripts). 3. Documentation ­ Any change that is made to procedures, work products and any other documentation materials of importance (ex: Cookbook, SOPs, Deliverables, etc.). Determination of CR/PR "type" is the most important criteria in determining the CR/PR process lifecycle. A CR/PR may NOT have more than one type. If a CR/PR is found to be of more than one type, it will need to be separated into additional CR/PRs and placed into a family. A family is the process by which related CR/PRs are to tracked, and allows the grouping of CR/PRs to aid in the monitoring of a specific problem.

4.3.1.4 Change Control Board
The CCB is subordinate to the ERB and is chartered to consider and disposition changes having program baseline impacts, The CCB is chaired by TSA TIM Program Management who has the authority to disposition a CR/PR and determine whether it can be implemented or will require presentation to the ERB. CCB membership consists of TSA TIM Program Office and supporting contractor personnel. Each CCB member has the responsibility to review CR/PR s for technical content, cost and schedule impacts, risk assessment, alternative solutions, implementation decision, and contract issues, potential impacts to other subsystems, and sub-contractor comments or quotes when applicable. In addition, each board member has full authority and responsibility for representing their functional area on issues or actions relevant to the change being presented. The CR/PR sponsor is required to attend the CCB and present the CR/PR and answer any questions which may arise. CCB assigned action items are either tracked to closure before the CR/PR is authorized to proceed in the change process, or they are made a part of the change itself and processed for closure with the implementation verification process. The board makes recommendations for approved changes that are forwarded for ERB consideration.

CCB disapproved CR/PR s are returned to the initiator for rescheduling, rework as necessary to support further consideration, or cancellation.

4.3.1.5 Change Request/Work Request Scheduling The contractor shall schedule when change request are to be evaluated/need to be evaluated. If a Change Request is given an urgent priority and must be resolved before the next board meeting, it can be scheduled to be resolved in an out-of-board meeting. Such actions are considered to be an exception to the normal change management process and require approval from the applicable review board chair prior to their submission for processing. Out-of-board decisions are documented in meeting minutes and a notice of their location distributed to the membership and meeting attendees. In these cases, CR/PRs undergo an accelerated implementation upon approval by the CCB Chairperson or designee. For example, the development, build, test, verification, and implementation processes may occur with a ClearQuest state of "DEV." The CR/PR is ultimately processed through all change control steps with appropriate documentation and updates in ClearQuest. 4.3.1.6 Change Request/Work Request Verification Once all stakeholders have agreed on a date, time and cost of change implementation, the change can be verified and then implemented into the system. Following implementation, a postimplementation review and Quality Assurance review will be carried out by the stakeholders to ensure the change achieved its goals. 4.3.1.7 Change Request/Work Request Closure CR/PR closure begins when notification of completion of approved activity associated with a given CR/PR is provided to Configuration Management. This is followed with a Quality Assurance review to verify that change actions have been accurately completed and implemented as authorized by the applicable review board.

5. Configuration Status Accounting
The formal process of tracking software entities through the steps in their evolution is referred to as Status Accounting or Configuration Status Accounting (CSA). Status Accounting provides the project manager with the data necessary to gauge and report project progress. Status Accounting provides a mechanism for maintaining a record of how software has evolved and where the software is at any time relative to the information contained in baseline documents. Status Accounting answers the following questions: (1) what happened? (2) Who did it? (3) When did it happen? (4) What else will be affected? Status Accounting is a function that increases in complexity as the software lifecycle progresses because of the multiple software representations that emerge with later baselines. This complexity generally results in larger amounts of data to be recorded and reported. The purpose of Status Accounting is to have the ability, at any point in the software lifecycle, to provide the current content of a given software configuration item or computer software component. If the entity is a software design description, a status accounting mechanism should allow developers to easily pull together any text files, graphic files and data files that may comprise the document. Likewise, change requests to software products should be easy to track and the status of these requests should be readily reproducible in an organized manner.

5.1

Configuration Status Accounting Practices

The contractor shall provide CSA information from the contractors information system to the maximum extent possible. The information system shall provide methods for collecting, recording, processing and maintaining data necessary to provide contractual status accounting information via reports and/or data base access. 5.2 Configuration Status Accounting Reports

CSA Reports shall include the following information: 1. Identification of current approved configuration documentation and configuration identifiers associated with each CI; 2. Status of proposed engineering changes from initiation to implementation; 3. Results of configuration audits; status and disposition of discrepancies; 4. Status of requests for critical and major deviations and waivers; 5. Traceability of changes from baselined documentation of each CI, and 6. Effectivity and installation status of configuration changes to all CIs at all locations.

6. Configuration Audits
Each proposed enhancement or other modification is examined by the appropriate review board for its impact, and the associated documentation is modified to reflect all approved changes. The current status of approved design is made known to all participants, and records are kept to provide an audit trail as the design evolves. This sequence occurs on an active and continuing basis as the design of the software and hardware is developed at successively more detailed levels. A thorough examination of the product is performed before product release to the field, comparing it with the baselined documentation. These configuration audits validate the compliance of the end product with stated requirements. 6.1 Audit Types

Functional Configuration Audits (FCAs) and Physical Configuration Audits (PCAs) will normally be conducted by the TSA prior to acceptance of a CI and prior to establishing the Product Baseline. This section shall describe the contractors approach to meeting the requirements of configuration audits, including: ˇ Plans, procedures, documentation, and schedules for functional and physical configuration audits; and ˇ Format for reporting results of in-process configuration audits. 6.1.1 Functional Configuration Audits The Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) is used to verify that the actual performance of the CI meets the requirements stated in its performance specification and to certify that the CI has met those requirements. For systems, the FCA is used to verify that the actual performance of the system meets the requirements stated in the system performance specification. In some cases, especially for very large, complex CIs and systems, the audits may be accomplished in increments. Each increment may address a specific functional area of the system/CI and will document any discrepancies that are found in the performance capabilities of that increment. After all of the increments have been completed, a final (summary) FCA may be held to address the status of all of the action items that have been identified by the incremental meetings and to document the status of the FCA for the system or CI in the minutes and certifications. In this way, the audit is effectively accomplished with a minimum of complications. 6.1.2 Physical Configuration Audits A Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) is used to examine the actual configuration of the CI that is representative of the product configuration in order to verify that the related design documentation matches the design of the deliverable CI. In performance based acquisition environment, the PCA addresses the accuracy of the documentation reflecting the production

design. It is also used to validate many of the supporting processes that the contractor uses in the production of the CI. The PCA is also used to verify that any elements of the CI that were redesigned after the completion of the FCA also meet the requirements of the CI's performance specification. In cases where the Government does not plan to control the detail design, it is still essential that the contractor conduct an internal PCA to define the starting point for controlling the production design and to establish a product baseline. Additional PCAs may be accomplished later during CI production if circumstances such as the following apply:  The original production line is "shut down" for several years and then production is restarted  The production contract for manufacture of a CI with a fairly complex, or difficult-to-manufacture, design is awarded to a new contractor or vendor. 6.2 Required Audit Information

Information that is required for audits shall include the unique characteristics of each CI that has been documented and or automatically identified in the configuration management system. These characteristics include:  Document o Unique identifier o Baseline identifier o Version o Author/owner o Title o Program/project reference(s) o Business area reference(s) o File type o Document type o Contract reference(s) o Dates (entered, updated, archived, etc.) Software o Unique identifier o Baseline identifier o Version o Relationship (how used, dependency) o Author/owner o File type o Programming language o Dates (entered, updated, archived, etc.) Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Software o Unique identifier o Name of software o Baseline identifier o Version o Standard Image

6.3

6.3.1 Problem Reporting This section describes the procedures to be followed for reporting, tracking, and resolving problems identified in both software/hardware items and system development and maintenance processes. Problems encountered during planning and development may result from defects in software, hardware, and supporting and development processes. Because of this diversity, the determination of the sources of a problem and the appropriate corrective action requires a centrally controlled system for monitoring problems and determining root causes. The TIM PMO and contractor staff will record and manage PR discrepancies in the TIM Rational ClearQuest database. A status report is provided on a regular basis to the PMO, Integrated Product Team (IPT) teams, and other affected groups. The purposes of these reports are to delineate those areas where: ˇ Processes are being followed correctly and are working effectively, ˇ Processes are being followed but are not working effectively, and ˇ Processes are not being followed. These reports shall be reported monthly at the TIM program management review (PMR). The content of these reports will be as follows: ˇ Accomplishments for the reporting period, e.g., completed QA reviews or audits; ˇ Activities for the reporting period, e.g., specific QM activities accomplished or current activity compared to scheduled tasks; and ˇ Issues and/or problems during the reporting period (e.g., issues that surfaced during QA reviews or audits) are reported to Program Management for review. ˇ Status of open issues or problems The focus of the program management review (PMR) meetings is the overall status of the program, the opportunity for information sharing across the integrated parts of the program, and to address issues which have been raised through the problem reporting of the individual program teams.

6.3.2 Corrective Action The corrective action process describes the system used to document, track, and resolve problems identified within the TIM program. This process is intended to be used by all TIM staff members and stakeholders within TIM when originating, replying to, or coordinating a Corrective Action Request (CAR). Configuration Management (CM) is responsible for this process. Corrective action is defined as an action taken to correct the occurrence of noncompliance, nonconformance and other conditions adverse to the quality of the TIM system.

C. CJIS-RS-0010 (V6R2), March 1998 - This version has come about in three stages. A V6 Working Draft was produced in August, 1997 and was reviewed at a User Technical Review on August 26, 1997. Subsequent comments were incorporated as revision 1 of this working draft and distributed on September 30, 1997 as Version 6, Revision 1 (Working Draft). Comments were received against revision 1 and were incorporated into an official V6R2 dated March 1998. C.1 V6WD, August 1997 - This Version 6 Working Draft incorporates the following RCFs: 1024R2 Removed range AGR, WTR, HTR, DPR and DOS from ten-print transactions. Added TAA to criminal ten-print transactions and CRI to all transactions requiring a response. Added PRI and case-ID extensions CIX LCX to latent transactions. Deleted the MIR as a separate transaction (subsumed into IRQ). Added latent requirements. Added placeholder for Type-7 and Type-9 records. Modified latent, and remote ten-print search requirements.

Established maximum sizes for fingerprint images. Established T2ISR, (Image Summary Response) transaction.

In addition to the RFCs listed above, the Version 6 Working Draft (V6WD) incorporates the following noteworthy general changes: 1. Data for the tables in Appendices B through K now are drawn from a database rather than being entered as text in the WordPerfect EFTS document. This database, which is built in Microsoft Access, contains application-specific functionality to generate those tables. The EFTS has been reformatted to present the data in Appendices D and E in a more concise manner. Text has been judiciously added to Section 1 and Appendix D to explain and provide a guide to the new table formats. Text has been added in Section 2 on the use of tagged fields and on error handling. JPEG has been added as an approved compression algorithm for fingerprint images (this applies to UK's Home Office only.) The Addendum, ANSI/NIST-ITL 1a-1997 (American National Standard For Information Systems - Data Format for the Exchange of Fingerprint, Facial & SMT Information) has been incorporated into the EFTS for Type-10 Record Definitions.

3. 4.

Further, there have been changes in V6WD to some data elements and/or logical records which are not due to a prio r RFC. These changes were made only to correct obvious oversights/errors in an RFC or in V5 data. Detail of these numerous changes has been documented in the EFTS V6WD Comments and Dispositions document. C.2 V6WDR1, September 30, 1997 - This revision of the working draft incorporates changes arising from the disposition of comments by attendees of the User Technical Review on August 26, 1997, together with changes due to comments from internal reviews of V6WD. The internal reviews have resulted in RFCs 1127R1, 1129R1, and 1130R1. While the intent of these was to change the IAFIS MDD, they have affected some EFTS data. All such changes have been captured in the EFTS V6 Comment Dispositions document.

C.3 V6R2, March 1998 - RFC 1168R1 incorporates changes arising from ISS comments against V6WDR1 and IAFIS/SEU activities to make engineering data consistent between the EFTS and IAFIS' Message Data Dictionary (MDD). These internal reviews have also resulted in some of the content of RFC 1149R1. While the intent of this RFC has been to correct the MDD, some changes also have affected the EFTS, and have been incorporated into V6R2. The following changes are noteworthy: 1. Every set using CRI now allows up to three instances of it. This provides a means to handle intermediate routing from the State Ident Bureau to the Local Booking Station where necessary. Additional instance of the CRI can be used as the States wish to support Applicant Submissions and other such needs. Text in the body of the EFTS (especially Sections 3 and Appendix C) now states more clearly the intent and use of transactions and elements. An Appendix L has been added that collects EFTS-wide summary tables for reference by developers. Currently, two types of tables have been put into this Appendix. The first is a set of two tables listing first in Alphabetic order, then in Tag order every EFTS element. v May 2, 2005

The second is a set of two tables, the first listing recordset requirements for each submission, the second listing recordset requirements for each possible response to each submission. EFTS specifications for elements and sets are now consistent with the IAFIS's MDD, now providing the same interface information to IAFIS segment developers and to the EFTS development community. These changes to Version 6 Revision 2 EFTS data, which are the results of a maturing IAFIS design, provide the robustness in the communication interface needed to support the user community's automation of ten-print submissions. CJIS-RS-0010 (V7), January 29, 1999 - This version incorporates several important revisions. New Type-9 records are defined for ten-print and latent features searches. Latent transactions are revised. Several appendices are revised to provide references that were noted as lacking, and organization of some material has been changed to make it more accessible than in previous versions. The following provides more detail: Added these to Appendix C. Made PAT mandatory in ten-print features search. Added RCD1, RCD2 to TPFS, TPIS, LFFS, LFIS, LPNQ. Added optional FGP to LPNQ. Remove IMA from LFFS Defined new Native Mode Searches for the EFTS. Replaced old T9TRANS (Table J-1) recordset with T9TRANS_L (Table J-1) for latent searches and T9TRANS_T (Table J-2) for ten-print searches. Completely replaced Appendix J as a result. Added Reference Note Table (Table J-3) to Appendix J. Major Revision to EFTS. Incorporated IAFIS View Review Errata affecting EFTS. Incorporated changes to Latent Transactions per November 15, 1998 EFTS Users Meeting. Incorporated various changes based upon user comments from NY, SC, CA, User Meeting Minutes, AFIS (Lockheed Martin, Orlando FL) EFIPS (Lockheed Martin, OakRidge TN), FBI Latent Fingerprint Section (Steve Meagher) and IAFIS System Engineering Unit. The following general revisions are of interest: 1. Replaced entire Appendix J. 2. Revised Appendix L, replacing reference tables cross-referencing element IDs and tag numbers, and tables listing recordsets by transaction type. 3. Added detail to error codes in Appendix M. 4. Reorganized Reference Note Tables, distributing notes to appendices in which they are referenced. 5. Added discussion on ORI vice CRI use. 6. Added discussion of User Defined fields and edit restrictions to same. 7. Revised discussion of IAFIS error handling. 8. Revised descriptions of latent and native- mode search transactions.

SECTION 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background For almost 100 years fingerprint cards have been accepted as the standard means for recording and storing fingerprint identification data. Over that period the content, format, and quality of fingerprint cards have been revised and refined. Fingerprint cards are now accepted as a national standard for the exchange of fingerprint, identification, and arrest data between criminal justice agencies. However, because fingerprint cards must be physically transported and processed, substantial delays are introduced into the identification cycle. To improve the speed and accuracy of the fingerprint identification process and eliminate the need for contributing agencies to create and mail paper fingerprint cards to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for processing, the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division is developing an Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) that will support the paperless submission of fingerprint records. In support of the development of the IAFIS and in accordance with the recommendations of the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Advisory Policy Board (APB) Identification Services Subcommittee, the FBI has developed in conjunction with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the fingerprint identification community, a standard for electronically encoding and transmitting fingerprint image, identification, and arrest data. This standard is comprised of an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard entitled "Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial, & Scar Mark & Tatoo (SMT) Information" (ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000). The ANSI standards define the content, format and units of measurement for the exchange of information that may be used in the fingerprint identification of a subject. Such information is intended for use in the interchange between criminal justice administrations or organizations that use an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), and will provide a common interface for AFISs and related systems nationwide. 1.2 Contents of Specification While the ANSI standards referenced in Section 1.1 will allow all AFISs and related systems to communicate, the purpose of this document is to specify certain requirements to which agencies must adhere to communicate electronically with the FBI's IAFIS. IAFIS has three segments: (1) Identification, Tasking and Networking (ITN/FBI), (2) Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS/FBI), and (3) the Interstate Identification Index (III/FBI). III/FBI electronic communications do not include fingerprints, and the requirements IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 1 May 2, 2005

are contained in appropriate NCIC manuals. This specification covers the remainder of the IAFIS electronic transmissions involving fingerprints. The basic requirements for Logical Records Type-1, Type-2, Type-4, Type-7, Type-9, and Type-10 set forth in the ANSI standards are also applicable to transmissions to the FBI. However, the FBI-specific requirements for the contents and format of Logical Records Type-2, Type-7, Type-9, and Type-10 as well as for any special requirements for the other record types, are contained in this specification. 1.3 Change Control The Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification (EFTS) defines the interface between IAFIS and the States' systems. Any changes to the data fields or formats within the EFTS must honor previously published protocols to ensure that the States' systems are not adversely affected. Since IAFIS and the States' systems are being developed independently, a process has been established which provides for coordinated enhancements within the various systems while maintaining reliable interoperability. This process is based in the tagged field structure defined in the 2000 ANSI standard, and a few "business rules". The rules simply state that field definitions cannot change over time or from system to system. If a change is needed, a new field is defined and assigned a new tag number. The new field cannot be made mandatory for established functionality, but merely enhances functionality for those systems wishing to incorporate the new definition. With this process in place, every system on the network has the opportunity to enhance its own system on its own schedule, yet no system is ever forced to make a change in order to maintain current functionality. 1.4 Tagged Fields 1.4.1 Interpretation of Tags In the construction and interpretation of the logical record, the tag number should not be taken as having a fixed number of digits. For example, in the version of the standard, Type-2 logical record, field tags are always shown as having three decimals between the decimal point and colon (2.NNN:data...). However, in future versions, Type-2 field tag numbers may be expanded to four or more digits (2.NNNN:data...). To accommodate such possibilities, the field numbers should be parsed as all digits between the period and colon. In the construction and interpretation of the logical record, there is no requirement that the tagged fields be present within the logical record in any given order, with the exception of the Length (LEN) and Image Designation Character (IDC), which must be in the first and second position in the record, respectively. Thus, for example, a State Ident Bureau could add the State Identification Number (SID) to the end of a Type-2 record created at the booking station. (This is less restrictive than the ANSI Standard's language.)

1.4.2 Use of Separator Characters Separator characters may best be understood by considering them necessary for what follows, not what precedes them. Thus, when a tagged field includes subfields1 (e.g., the ASL field contains subfields DOO and AOL), and another subfield is still to follow, the following one must be separated from the one preceding it by the unit separator character. If what is to follow is a repetition of a field or group of subfields, a record separator must separate the preceding field or group of subfields from the repetition to follow. If what is to follow is a new field, then the group separator character is used. If the record is complete after the previous field, the file separator is used. Per NIST, successive separator characters now may be used with no intervening blank or other character when a subfield is missing. In Type-2 records, IAFIS recognizes the following sequences as meaning that a subfield is missing: <US><US>, <US><RS>, <US><GS>, and <US><FS>. These are needed to obviate the need for IAFISs validating each subfield in a grouped field to see whether it contains valid data or merely a blank. This will keep invalid data out of IAFIS databases. 1.5 Error Handling Error processing takes on two primary forms within IAFIS. These are front-end error detection and internal process error detection and correction. The front-end process examines every incoming transaction from a security and mandatory data perspective. Potential security violations are rejected and transferred immediately to a system administrator. Transactions lacking mandatory data, or that are incomplete in referenced content, are rejected. All mandatory data and all optional data fields are edit checked for length and type of data included. Optional data failing this validation check are ignored. Mandatory data that fail this validation check are passed to a QC Service Provider for resolution. If the Service Provider can correct the data, the transaction will be forwarded for further processing. If the Service Provider cannot resolve the issue, the transaction can either be rejected or sent forward for attempted resolution later in the process. Secondary edit checks are performed any time an IAFIS segment attempts to utilize incoming data to perform a search or update a database. Any such action will check the field according to length and type as well as content. Some data values are content sensitive. That is, they can only be examined with respect to the databases against which they are to be applied. Errors in submissions detected at that time will generally be forwarded to a Logic Error Resolution Service Provider. At that point, appropriate actions can be taken to correct the discrepancy and an internal resubmission of the transaction can take place. Alternatively, if the Service Provider cannot resolve the issue, the transaction can be rejected.

The EFTS' use of the term subfield is synonymous with the term information item found in the ANSI Standard. 3 May 2, 2005

In the interpretation of the logical record, tags that are not defined for the requested transaction are to be ignored; their inclusion is not to be considered an error. This rule makes it possible to use a single transmission format, for example, to control both intrastate and interstate transmissions. Fields should not be transmitted when there is no value present (e.g., ... 2.033:<GS> ...). However, receipt of such an empty field, if the field is not mandatory, should not result in rejection of the record or issuance of an error message. Rejection will occur, however, when missing or incorrect data would frustrate processing of the transaction. The following list illustrates these types of errors: · · · A mandatory field is missing in a submitted recordset (e.g., NAM is missing in T2CAR) and would result in immediate rejection; The format of a mandatory field is incorrect (e.g., an alpha character is discovered in the SOC field) and would result in an attempt to correct the data; The range of data of a mandatory field is incorrect (e.g., a DOB of 18871332 was submitted - century, month, and day are all out of range) and would result in an attempt to correct the data; Incorrect data is discovered that cannot be corrected by a service provider, and without which, the transaction processing cannot proceed will result in the transaction being rejected;

·

Appendix M lists the current set of Error Messages that are pertinent to the EFTS user (i.e., IAFIS internal errors are not listed). 1.6 Identifying Previous Transactions The user may wish to refer to previous transactions for the purpose of follow up or resubmission. The pertinent information is contained in two Type-1 fields, 1.09 Transaction Control Number (TCN) and 1.10 Transaction Control Reference (TCR) (See Appendix B). Upon submitting a transaction to the FBI, the submitter places his control number in the TCN field in the Type-1 record. For submissions not requiring reference to a prior transaction, the TCR field is omitted. When the FBI has completed processing the transaction and generates the response, it places the submitter's control number (the received TCN) into the TCR field of the response as a reference number the submitter can use to mate the response with the original submission. The FBI also places its own internal identifier for that transaction (the ICN, or IAFIS Control Number, a 20-character alphanumeric field) in the TCN field of the response. The TCN in the response can be used by the submitter should he have to reopen the transaction for any purpose. For example, if the FBI rejected the first submission of a user-fee transaction (which the submitter is entitled to resubmit one time free of charge if the rejection was due to poor quality fingerprint images), the user would place this number in the TC R field of the resubmitted transaction to enable the FBI to verify the user's authorization to resubmit at nocharge.

1.7 Data Storage in the IAFIS Database Data that is submitted in IAFIS transactions may or may not be stored in a table in the IAFIS database. Data that is not stored is considered to be user-defined. It is carried in transactions as an aid to the submitter in interpreting or routing the FBI's response to the submission, and is returned verbatim to the user. Data that is stored in IAFIS is always converted to uppercase prior to storage. Therefore, if this data is returned as part of the response to a subsequent submission (or a III inquiry), it may differ (in case only) from the originally submitted data. 1.8 Guidance on ORI and CRI Usage The following description offers some guidance for the use of the CRI field to provide appropriate authorization to perform file maintenance within IAFIS. We develop this scenario by examining how an electronic submission might be formed by a contributor and passed to IAFIS for evaluation. This is intended as an example since there are many other requirements that might influence the final design. Ultimately, the contributors manage the use of the CRI field. Assume a print is obtained by a local agency, passed to a county agency for processing and subsequently to the CTA for transmission to the FBI. In such a case the transmission of ORIs and CRIs might appear as follows:

LOCAL | ORI |----------------->

COUNTY_AGENCY | ORI |-----------------> | CRI1 |----------------->

STATE_CTA | ORI | | CRI2 | | CRI1 |

When generated at the local level, no CRI need exist since this ORI is the originator. On receipt by the county agency and subsequent transmission to the state CTA, the original ORI is entered as the first instance of the CRI and the county ORI replaces the local ORI in the ORI field. On receipt by the state CTA and for subsequent retransmission to the FBI, the Local ORI is retained as CRI1, the county ORI is entered as CRI2, and the ORI of the state CTA is entered in the ORI field. The transaction is then forwarded to the FBI via the CJIS WAN. CRI1, the local ORI, is then used as the authority for action, and thus retains `ownership' of the transaction. Then, only CRI1 can modify, cancel, confirm or delete a latent transaction. In the response, the transaction is sent to the ORI from which it was sent and it is the responsibility of the state CTA to route it properly to the county agency identified in CRI2. The county agency, in turn, would route the response to the local agency as appropriate.

SECTION 2 SCOPE This document specifies the file and record content, format, and data codes necessary for the exchange of fingerprint identification information between Federal, State and local users and the FBI. It provides a description of all requests and responses associated with electronic fingerprint identification services. These fingerprint identification services include the following: 1. 2. 3. Ten-Print Services Latent Services Fingerprint Image Services

Ten-print services can be accessed through electronic ten-print submissions and remote searches. Electronic submissions involve processing and evaluation judgments by FBI personnel. Remote searches are transactions that interface with automated equipment without human intervention by FBI personnel. Ten-print services also include requests to update current fingerprint images. Latent services are comprised of electronic latent submissions handled by FBI latent examiners and automatic remote searches of the FBI latent databases. Finally, image requests are used to solicit fingerprint images stored by the FBI. All transactions and messages are compliant with the ANSI standard for exchange of fingerprint information. Section 3 gives a description of the seven types of fingerprint transactions in the electronic environment.

3.1 Electronic Ten-print Submissions The processing flow for criminal ten-print electronic submissions is illustrated in Figure 1, "Electronic Ten-Print Submission." These submissions will originate from live-scan booking terminals or card scanners at either the federal, state or local level. Local submissions may be processed by a local AFIS and electronically transmitted to a state identification bureau for processing. If an identification is made at the state level, an Ident response will be transmitted back to the local agency, and if it is a criterion offense, it is to be forwarded to the FBI. The processing flow for a civil ten-print electronic submission is similar to the criminal ten-print flow, except that in the event of state level Ident response, the submission may still be forwarded to the FBI for processing under Federal and/or state statutory authority.

If no identification is made, the data will be forwarded via the CJIS WAN to the FBI for processing by IAFIS. Transmitted data will be automatically edited and a search will be conducted of the FBI's fingerprint files, utilizing the III segment's subject search and the AFIS segment's feature search capabilities. The identification of fingerprint images of any viable file candidates will be verified by at least one FBI fingerprint examiner. Electronic responses 2 from IAFIS to the contributor will be electronically routed via the CJIS WAN through the State Identification Bureau (the ORI). Subsequent routing to the arresting agency is made by the State Ident Bureau using the CRI. Additional copies are routed by the State Ident Bureau using the SCO or other related information (see Appendices B and C for detailed ORI, SCO and CRI definitions). Electronic criminal transactions will have a nominal 2- hour turnaround within IAFIS. Civil transactions, and card-based transactions, once received, will have a 24-hour nominal turnaround. The turnaround times are based on the type of transaction and are specified in Appendix A. There are several types of ten-print electronic submissions that will be accepted by the FBI. The particular type of submission is identified in the Type of Transaction (TOT) Field in the Type-1 record that is used with each transaction. The following are the TOTs for ten-print submissions: TOT CAR CNA FANC FAUF NFAP NFUF MAP DEK DEU MPR AMN TRANSACTION Criminal Ten-Print Submission (Answer Required) Criminal Ten-Print Submission (No Answer Necessary) Federal Applicant (No Charge) Federal Applicant User Fee Non-Federal Advanced Payment Non-Federal Applicant User Fee Miscellaneous Applicant Civil Known Deceased Unknown Deceased Missing Person Amnesia Victim

Ten-Print Transaction Error

3.1.1 Type of Transaction Definitions 3.1.1.1 Criminal Ten-Print Submission (Answer Required) (CAR) This transaction is a criminal arrest fingerprint submission for which the requester desires that a response be returned. It contains ten rolled and four plain impressions of all ten fingers, as well as information relative to an arrest or to custody or supervisory status and optionally may include up to 4 photos of the subject. The biographical data and fingerprint images are used to determine potential candidates with criminal records at the FBI. This TOT is also used for an inquiry on a criminal suspect or informant, in which case arrest, custody, or supervisory data may or may not be present (Retention Code set to "N"). Requirements for the use of the ASL and CSL fields in these cases are discussed in Appendix C. The fingerprint images of those candidates are then compared with those in the submission and an identification or nonidentification decision is determined. The criminal records are updated (if the Retention Code is set to "Y") the photos are added to the file and a response is returned to the contributor. The response will always contain the Ident/Non-Ident decision, and will contain the electronic rap sheet if requested. Table D-1 gives the logical record layout for the CAR TOT. 3.1.1.2 Criminal Ten-Print Submission (No Answer Necessary) (CNA) This transaction is a criminal arrest fingerprint submission for which the requester desires that no response be transmitted back. Otherwise, it is identical to the CAR request described above, containing ten rolled and four plain impressions, arrest, custody or supervisory status data, and optionally up to 4 photos of the subject. Processing is also identical except that no response is returned. However, a communication protocol acknowledgment will be returned to the contributor to confirm receipt of the transaction. The Retention Code for this transaction must be set to "Y". The CNA TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.1.1.3 Federal Applicant (No Charge) (FANC) This transaction pertains to an individual who is fingerprinted in connection with applying for criminal justice employment with the Federal Government. When this TOT is used, there is no charge assessed to the contributor. Federal agencies that are considered "User Fee" contributors must not use this TOT, but use "FAUF" instead (see description below). The FANC TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.1.1.4 Federal Applicant User Fee (FAUF) These submissions come from: (1) any of the branches of the U. S. military in connection with individuals enlisting or being considered for Officers' Candidate School (OCS); and (2) federal agencies in connection with employment, security updates, or contract personnel. The FAUF TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 12 May 2, 2005

found in Table C-1. See also Section 1.6 for a discussion of the use of TCN and TCR in nocharge resubmittal of user-fee submissions that the FBI has rejected. Such resubmittals are allowed only when the fingerprint image quality of the original submission was unacceptable. 3.1.1.5 Non-Federal Applicant User Fee (NFUF) These submissions are for non-criminal justice and licensing purposes in which the contributor is charged a fee. Examples of the types of contributors of this type of transaction are: federal and state banking institutions, regulatory agencies (such as stock exchanges, bankers' associations, securities dealers, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, racing or gaming control board, etc.). Their purpose for submitting such requests is to ascertain whethe r individuals who have applied for licensing or employment with their organizations have any past criminal histories. The NFUF TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. See also Section 1.6 for a discussion of the use of TCN and TCR in no-charge resubmittal of user- fee submissions that the FBI has rejected. Such resubmittals are allowed only when the fingerprint image quality of the original submission was unacceptable. 3.1.1.6 Miscellaneous Applicant Civil (MAP) These no-charge submissions are for non-federal law enforcement and criminal justice employment. The MAP TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.1.1.7 Known Deceased (DEK) These transactions are submitted for a deceased individual whose identity is known to the contributor. If the fingerprints are determined to be identical to those of a subject in the FBI's criminal files, the subject's FBI record will be marked as deceased. The ICO field in this submission must be filled with the text "DECEASED". The DEK TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.1.1.8 Unknown Deceased (DEU) This transaction is submitted with fingerprints taken from an individual who was deceased at that time but whose identity was not known to the contributor. If the fingerprints are determined to be identical to those of a subject in the FBI's criminal files, the subject's FBI record will be marked as deceased and the contributor will be notified of the results. Should no identification to a subject on file be effected, the subject will be added to the criminal file in order to be identified with missing persons reports. A search of the Civil File will be conducted following the Criminal File search if a "Y" is placed in the CSR field. The DEU TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1.

3.1.1.9 Missing Person (MPR) These non-criminal submissions pertain to persons reported as missing. Their submission causes a search of the FBI files and may result in the placement of a "stop" in FBI automated files to create the possibility of a future fingerprint submission (of any type) hitting against the original set of fingerprints and establishing the person's whereabouts. These subjects are added to the Criminal File. The Action to be Taken (ACN) field of the response will indicate if a "stop" has been established. The ICO field in this submission must be filled with the text "MISSING PERSON". A search of the Civil File will be conducted following the Criminal File search if a "Y" is placed in the CAR field. The MPR TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.1.1.10 Amnesia Victim (AMN) These non-criminal submissions pertain to persons known to have amnesia who are unaware of their own identity. The submission causes a search of the FBI files and ma y result in the placement of a "stop" in FBI automated files to create the possibility of a future fingerprint submission (of any type) hitting against the original set of fingerprints and establishing the person's identity. These subjects are added to the Criminal File. The ACN field of the response will indicate if a "stop" has been established. The ICO field in this submission must be filled with the text "AMNESIA VICTIM". A search of the Civil File will be conducted following the Criminal File search if a "Y" is placed in the CSR field. The AMN TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.1.1.11 Submission Results -- Electronic (SRE) This transaction is returned by the FBI in response to ten-print submissions. The response will always contain the Ident/Non-Ident decision, and will contain the electronic rap sheet if requested. Table 3-1 describes which NAME, FBI number and State ID (SID) are returned in the SRE for Criminal, Civil and Humanitarian submissions, and for Non-Ident and Ident results. A non- matching NAME is returned in the electronic rap sheet (ERS), if one was requested. The following fields, which are not stored in IAFIS, are always returned exactly as submitted: ATN, SCO, EAD, OCP, RES, and TAA. A single electronic response will be sent to the contributor through the state identification bureau via the CJIS WAN. In the case that circumstances delay processing an EFTS request, the requestor will receive a preliminary electronic response coded as a Non-Ident with an ERS. The ERS will contain a report explaining results are not available due to a delay. When they complete processing, the FBI will print a Non-Ident or Ident response report and mail it to the requestor. Table D-2 gives the logical record layout for the SRE TOT. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1.

Under certain circumstances, the SRE will contain Special Table Data (STD). For example, this would be included in an Non-Ident Report (NIDR) if an FBI number was submitted. It would be included in an Ident Report (IDRR) if a submitted FBI number did not match the FBI number in the Master File for subject. It would be included in an IDRR or NIDR, as appropriate, if the Master File FBI number was marked expunged, deleted, or consolidated. 3.1.1.12 Ten Print Transaction Error (ERRT) This transaction is returned by the FBI to indicate a transaction error. It includes a message field (MSG) indicating the type of error detected. Error responses are described in Section 3.8. The ERRT TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. Currently defined error messages are detailed in Appendix M.

3.1.1.13 Non-Federal Advanced Payment (NFAP) These submissions are for non-criminal justice purposes in which the contributor is charged a fee in advance. Examples of the types of contributors for this TOT are as follows: federal citizenship and immigration services (such as training candidate check programs). The purpose for submitting such requests is to ascertain whether individuals, who have applied for training through the contributor organizations, have any past criminal histories. The NFAP TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields NFAP uses may be found in Table C-1. See also Section 1.6 for a discussion of the use of TCN and TCR in no-charge resubmittal of user- fee submissions that the FBI has rejected. Such resubmittals are allowed only when the fingerprint image quality of the original submission was unacceptable. Note: NFAP is a limiteduse TOT that requires coordination with CJIS prior to use. 3.1.2 Requirements for Logical Record Types Submissions : The types and quantities of logical records required in an electronic ten-print submission are as follows: C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record

Nominally either, C 14 - Type-4 records as follows: 10 Rolled Impressions 4 Sets of Plain Impressions Or C

For non-criminal justice purposes (e.g., FAUF, FANC, NFUF, NFAP, MAP) and with CJIS coordination and authorization, 3 ­ Type-14 records (refer to Appendix N) as follows: 2 Plain Simultaneous 4 Finger Impressions 1 Plain Left and Right Thumb Impression 0-4 - Type-10 Records containing photos may be submitted with CAR, CNA, AMN, DEK, DEU, and MPR transactions. Photos are not allowed with FANC, FAUF, MAP, NFAP, and NFUF transactions.

(See Appendix C write-up of the AMP field for how to handle submissions with fewer than 10 printable fingers.) Responses: In response to an electronic ten-print submission, the following logical records will be returned: C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record 16 May 2, 2005

IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1

3.2 Remote Ten-Print Searches To conduct a remote ten-print search of the FBI's database, the sending agency will electronically transmit fingerprint images and classification information as required by the AFIS/FBI (i.e., the AMP, when needed), or remotely extracted fingerprint characteristics. Fingerprint characteristics include classification, fingerprint features, and any other derived data required by AFIS/FBI. If the originator is a local agency, the request will go through their State identification bureau. The subsequent FBI search will be conducted automatically with no additional manual editing or processing. If candidates are identified, up to 25 candidates' FBI numbers are returned to the transmitting agency along with fingerprint images from the highest scoring candidate. The user can request specific finger images, up to all 14 fingerprint images, via the Fingerprint Number(s) Requested (FNR) field. This process differs from electronic ten-print submission processing in that there is no manual intervention on the part of the FBI. The sender must designate the TOT in the Type-1 record to specify the type of search request. The following list of TOTs is applicable to remote ten-print searches transmitted to the FBI: TOT TPIS TPFS TPRS Transaction Ten-Print Fingerprint Image Searches Ten-Print Fingerprint Features Searches Ten-Print Rap Sheet

A hierarchical approach to ten-print searches must be adhered to. Searches submitted by local agencies must be processed by the local AFIS (if available) and electronically transmitted to a state AFIS (if available), before submitting a search to the FBI. If an identification is made at any of the previous levels, the Ident response will be transmitted to the originating agency and there will be no further processing of the request at a higher level. The processing flow for remote ten-print searches is shown in Figure 2, "Remote Ten-Print Search." All electronic transactions between the FBI and the originating state agency will be routed via the CJIS WAN. State and local agencies must handle the continuance of these transactions among themselves through the state network. The following are the potential responses to remote ten-print fingerprint searches: TOT SRT ERRT RESPONSE TRANSACTION Search Result - Ten-print Ten-Print Transaction Error

The response to a valid remote ten-print search will include a candidate list and the fingerprint images of the highest scoring candidate who potentially matches the submitted IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 17 May 2, 2005

3.2.1 Type of Transaction Definitions 3.2.1.1 Ten-Print Fingerprint Image Searches (TPIS) The ten-print fingerprint images are transmitted along with any required fingerprint classification information and descriptors by the originator. The PAT field is to be included for every amputated or unprintable finger. The fingerprint characteristics will be automatically extracted from the image at the FBI with no human intervention. There will be no manual editing of fingerprint characteristics. The search process of the criminal fingerprint files is conducted and the results transmitted to the originator. The response consists of the match report including the identification of matching candidates and the corresponding fingerprint images of the candidate with the highest score. Images for the remaining candidates may be retrieved

through separate image retrieval requests. The TPIS TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1.

3.2.1.2 Ten-Print Fingerprint Features Search (TPFS) The fingerprint characteristics, including classification, are extracted and transmitted by the originator along with search criteria. The search process uses this information to generate the candidate list. The response is similar to those for TPIS transactions. The TPFS TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. (Note: The fingerprint characteristics referred to here are the native-mode fingerprint characteristics of the FBI's AFIS; i.e., the fingerprint characteristics' data transmitted will be in a format used or accepted by AFIS/FBI. The originating agency must have the capability to extract and encode fingerprint characteristics data in the FBI native mode in order to use this TOT.) 3.2.1.3 Search Results -- Ten-Print (SRT) This transaction is returned by the FBI in response to a remote ten-print search request. It includes a candidate list comprised of the names and FBI numbers of up to 25 subjects selected by AFIS/FBI as potential matches to the fingerprint images or features that were submitted. The fingerprint image(s) of the first candidate on the candidate list will also be included. The fingerprint images in the response may be specified by finger position in the search request. The SRT TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.2.1.4 Ten-Print Transaction Error (ERRT) This transaction is returned by the FBI to indicate a transaction error. It includes a message field (MSG) indicating the type of error detected. Error responses are described in Section 3.8. The ERRT TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.2.1.5 Ten-Print Rap Sheet Searches (TPRS) The ten-print fingerprint images are transmitted along with any required fingerprint classification information and descriptors by the originator. The PAT field is to be included for every amputated or unprintable finger. The fingerprint characteristics will be automatically extracted from the image at the FBI with no human intervention. There will be no manual editing of fingerprint characteristics. The search process of the criminal fingerprint files is conducted and the results transmitted to the originator. The response consists of rap sheets for up to the top twenty candidates. Images are not returned as part of this process. The TPRS TOT is summarized in Table D-3. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. Note: TPRS is a limited-use TOT tha t requires coordination with CJIS prior to use. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 19 May 2, 2005

3.2.2 Requirements for Logical Record Types Input: The types and quantities of logical records required to submit a remote ten-print search are as follows: C C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record 1 to 10 - Type-4 or Type-9 Fingerprint Image Records containing rolled impressions or features.

Response: In response to a remote ten-print search request, the following logical records will be returned: C C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record 0 to 14 - Type-4 fingerprint image records containing the requested fingerprint images of the first candidate.

The remaining candidates' fingerprints may be retrieved via a remote request for fingerprint image transaction.

3.3 Electronic Submission of Latent Prints Electronic latent print submissions will originate from the agency having legal jurisdiction of the case, either federal, state or local. The crime scene evidence will be processed and the desired latent prints will be electronically captured. The term "latent prints" includes fingerprints, palm prints, toe prints, and footprints. Investigation of latent cases may also generate ten-prints used for comparison purposes (e.g., suspect, victim, other personnel with authorized access to the crime scene). The sender must designate the TOT in the Type-1 record to specify which process is to be followed. The following TOTs are applicable to electronic latent print submissions to the FBI: TOT LFS CFS MCS ELR TRANSACTION Latent Fingerprint Image(s) Submission Comparison Fingerprint Image(s) Submission Major Case Image(s) Submission Evaluation Latent Fingerprint Submission Request

A hierarchical approach to AFIS searches must be adhered to. Submissions by local agencies must be processed by the local AFIS (if available) and electronically transmitted to a state AFIS (if available) before being submitted to the FBI. If an identification is made at any of the previous levels, the Ident response will be transmitted to the originating agency and there will be no further processing of the request at a higher level. All electronic transactions between the FBI and the originating agency will be routed via the CJIS WAN. State and local agencies must handle the continuance of these transactions among themselves through the state network. The processing flow for electronic latent transactions is illustrated in Figure 3, "Electronic Latent Submission." The following are the responses to electronic latent submissions: TOT LSR NAR ERRL RESPONSE TRANSACTION Latent Submission Results Notification of Action Response Latent Transaction Error

The FBI's response to a latent fingerprint image submission (i.e., LFS) contains a TOT of "LSR" (denoting "Latent Submission -- Results") in the Type-1 Record. It includes the identification of a subject with matching fingerprints or a non- identification decision. If the response to an LFS transaction is a non- identification, the latent case may be stored in the Unsolved Latent File. If there is an error in the submittal, an ERRL response will be returned.

The responses to ELR submissions contain a TOT of "NAR" (denoting "Notification of Action Response"). It defines the action taken based on the analysis of the submitted latent images. For an ELR submission, the NAR may indicate that a latent case will be established. There will be no IAFIS responses other than communication protocols acknowledgments for the transaction types CFS and MCS. However, a Latent Fingerprint Section (LFPS) Report may be generated and provided to the contributor. NOTE: This report is not an automated report and will not be transmitted electronically through IAFIS. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 22 May 2, 2005

3.3.1 Type of Transaction Definitions 3.3.1.1 Latent Fingerprint Image(s) Submission (LFS) A Latent Fingerprint Image Submission is intended solely for the purpose of executing an AFIS search, and is to be used by state, local, or other Federal agencies not able to extract IAFIS-compatible minutiae. The latent fingerprint images are transmitted along with the search criteria by the originator. Multiple fingerprint images may be submitted if the submitter believes the images are from a single subject. Multiple images also must be accompanied by a finger number for each image. Only this set of finger numbers will be searched. The FBI latent fingerprint specialists will execute a preliminary search (penetration query) to determine if the criteria exceeds the 30 percent threshold. If the search criteria exceeds that 30 percent limit, the search will be rejected. If the 30 percent limit is not exceeded, then FBI latent fingerprint specialists will submit the search for processing. Latent fingerprint specialists will perform comparisons of the search latent fingerprint image(s) against the candidate(s) selected and make the Ident/non-Ident decision. The Ident/non-Ident decision will be transmitted as a response (i.e., LSR), including the name and FBI Number of the identified subject. The LSR will include the full set of fourteen ten-print images if an identification has been made. The latent search image(s) will be temporarily stored in the Unsolved Latent File for fourteen days if requested in the submission by the originator. If the search results in a non-Ident, the addition of the latent image to the Unsolved Latent File will be confirmed. The LFS TOT is summarized in Table E 1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.3.1.2 Comparison Fingerprint Image(s) Submission (CFS) (For use by FBI only) This TOT provides for the transmission of ten-print fingerprint images or other known prints from individual(s) who could have caused the latent impressions associated with a case. The CFS is intended solely for internal FBI use. The comparison prints may consist of the following: 1. 2. 3. 4. Suspect known prints Victim known prints Known prints from individuals being compared for purposes of elimination Other individuals involved in the case

The submittal may include all the fingerprints normally enclosed in a ten-print submittal plus optional additional prints (e.g., palm prints), if applicable. The known print images will be stored and accessible to the fingerprint specialist for comparison and analysis. Elimination prints for several individuals must be sent as individual submittals for each. No electronic response other than communication protocol acknowledgment of receipt is returned for this TOT. The CFS TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1.

3.3.1.3 Major Case Image(s) Submission (MCS) (For use by FBI only) This TOT provides for the submittal of fingerprints normally enclosed in a ten-print submittal plus additional images of the extreme tips, sides, and lower joints of the fingers, and surface and extreme sides of palms for possible use in comparisons for a case. The MCS is intended solely for internal FBI use. The submitted prints will be added to the Major Case Image File. In addition, the ten-prints may be searched against the criminal fingerprint databases, and providing that all required data is submitted, it may be used to establish a new record in the criminal subject databases or to update existing records on the subject. No electronic response other than communication protocol acknowledgment of receipt is returned for this TOT. The MCS TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.3.1.4 Evaluation Latent Fingerprint Submission Request (ELR) (For use by FBI only) This is a transaction to be used solely for FBI purposes, including FBI field office consultations with the LFPS examiners. The contents of the submission are similar to a latent submission (i.e., LFS). The transaction will result in a reply (e.g., NAR) indicating the action to be taken. The action could be the establishment of a latent case, a request for additional information, or an evaluation of the case feasibility and recommendations for further actions. The ELR TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.3.1.5 Latent Submission Results (LSR) This transaction is in response to a latent fingerprint submission (LFS transactions). It includes a Search Results Findings (SRF) field indicating an identification or non-identification decision and, if the LFS results in an identification, it returns a name, FBI Number, and full set of fourteen ten-print images of the identified subject. The LSR TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.3.1.6 Notification of Action Response (NAR) This transaction will be in response to an evaluation request (ELR transaction). The response may include a message field (MSG) indicating the results of the evaluation or recommendations for further actions included in the Action to be Taken field (ACN). The NAR TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1.

3.3.1.8 Latent Transaction Error (ERRL) This transaction is returned by the FBI in response to a transaction that contained errors such as search exceeding 30 percent threshold, missing or inadequate quality fingerprints, missing mandatory information, or invalid contents. The MSG field shall include additional information on the causes for the rejection. Error responses are described in Section 3.8. The ERRL TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.3.2 Requirements for Logical Record Types Submission: The types and quantities of logical records required in electronic latent submissions and requests are as follows: C C C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record 1 to 14 - Type-4 Fingerprint Image Records. (1 to 10 records for latent submissions, 14 records for comparison ten-print fingerprint submissions, or an optional set of 14 images for major case submissions), or 1 or more - Type-7 records containing miscellaneous (e.g., palm prints as part of a CFS or MCS) or high resolution (greater than 500 dpi) latent images. The LFS and ELR submissions are limited to 10 Type-7 records. The MCS may have more than 10.

Response: In response to a latent submission (LFS), the following logical records will be returned (in the LSR): C C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record 0 to 14 - Type-4 Fingerprint Image Records, containing the ten-print fingerprint images corresponding to the finger of positions of the submitted latent images. (optional for LSR responses at the discretio n of the originator)

3.4 Remote Latent Fingerprint Searches An IAFIS user may transmit one or more latent fingerprint images or corresponding features sets, assumed to be from the same subject, to be searched against the FBI's Ten-Print Criminal Features Master File (a Latent Cognizant search). This remote latent fingerprint search request will originate from the agency having legal jurisdiction of the case, either federal, state or local. The crime scene evidence will be processed and the desired latent fingerprints will be electronically captured. To conduct a remote latent fingerprint search, the originating agency will electronically transmit latent fingerprint images and/or FBI native- mode fingerprint features. These images or features may be stored in the Unsolved Latent File (ULF) through use of the ULF flag, which is included in the search request. If the ULF flag is set to"yes", the submitted fingerprint image(s) and/or features will be temporarily added to the ULF file for fourteen days (the default setting of the ULF flag is "no"). The ULF flag is present in the Latent Fingerprint Image Search (LFIS), the Latent Fingerprint Features Search (LFFS), and the Latent Fingerprint Submission (LFS) messages. The descriptor data contained in the Type-2 records, T2LFFS and T2LFIS, are used as search parameters to narrow the search penetration so that the 30% maximum is not exceeded. The same descriptors may be submitted in a separate Latent Penetration Query, prior to initiating the search, to determine the penetration. The remote latent fingerprint search process differs from the electronic latent submissions in that there will be no human intervention on the part of the FBI. The sender must designate the TOT to specify which process is to be followed. The following list of TOTs is applicable to remote latent fingerprint searches transmitted to the FBI: TOT LFIS LFFS LPNQ TRANSACTION Latent Fingerprint Image(s) Searches Latent Fingerprint Features Searches Latent Penetration Query

A hierarchical approach to AFIS searches must be adhered to. Transactions generated by local agencies must be processed by the local AFIS (if available) and electronically transmitted to a state AFIS (if available) before submitting a search to the FBI. If an identification is made as a result of processing at any of the previous levels, there will be no further processing of the request at a higher level. All electronic transactions between the FBI and the originating agency will be routed via the CJIS WAN. State and local agencies must handle the continuance of these transactions among themselves through the state network.

The following are the potential responses to remote latent fingerprint transactions: TOT SRL LPNR ULM ERRL RESPONSE TRANSACTION Search Result - Latent Latent Penetration Response Unsolved Latent Match Response Latent Transaction Error

The response to a valid remote latent search transaction will contain a TOT of "SRL" (denoting "Search Results - Latent") in the Typ e-1 Record. It will also include the (up to NCR) fingerprint image(s) of the finger(s) that potentially matches the latent fingerprint. If the remote latent search included more than one finger, the image corresponding to the highest matched score for each candidate will be returned. The search parameters must limit the search to no more than 30 percent of the population of the file being searched. A Latent Penetration Query may be sent to determine the percentage of repository penetration prior to initiation of a search. The results will be returned in a Latent Penetration Response. Any search request for the latent cognizant repository that does not include sufficient search parameters to limit the search to 30 percent will result in a Latent Transaction Error (ERRL) response. The response will include the (two digit) percentage of the repository penetration determined from the submitted parameters in the Status/Error Message (MSG) field of the Type-2 record. Detection of errors will also cause a Latent Transaction Error (ERRL) response. The ULM may be a delayed response to an LFFS or LFIS (Appendix L, Table L-4). If a ten-print submission made after an LFFS or LFIS that has added a latent fingerprint image to the Unsolved Latent File matches that latent print, a ULM will be sent to the latent print contributor. The processing flow for remote latent fingerprint image transactions is illustrated in Figure 4, "Remote Latent Search".

3.4.1 Type of Transaction Definitions 3.4.1.1 Latent Fingerprint Image(s) Search (LFIS) The latent fingerprint image(s) are transmitted along with the search criteria by the originator. The fingerprint features will be automatically extracted from the images with no human intervention. There will be no manual editing of fingerprint characteristics. IAFIS will conduct a search of the Latent Cognizant repository and will transmit the results to the originator. In the event that images are of insufficient quality for AFIS/FBI to be able to extract features and perform a search, IAFIS will respond with a Latent Transaction Error message. Multiple fingerprint images may be searched if the submitter believes the images are from a single subject. Multiple images must be accompanied by a finger position for each image. Only this set of finger numbers will be searched. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 28 May 2, 2005

If, in submitting a single latent image, the finger position of the image is unknown, submitter may use the PAT (2.034) and FGP (2.074) fields and the FGN field of the Type-7 as follows to indicate that the position is unknown while allowing speculation on the finger position: (1) set the Finger Number subfield of PAT to "00", to indicate UNKNOWN, while supplying the Pattern Classification Code as usual; (2) in conjunction, submit one or more instances of the FGP field containing the finger position guesses; and (3) in the FGN field of the Type-7 record, send a binary "0". If many finger guesses for a single finger search are provided, the PAT/RCD1/RCD2 fields should be entered only for the first finger guess and will be automatically duplicated by IAFIS for all other finger guesses. Latent fingerprints submitted for remote searches may be added to the Unsolved Latent File as discussed in Paragraph 3.3.1.1. One or two Type-2 records may be submitted in the search message. IAFIS will automatically use the descriptive data in the first Type-2 record for the search. If originators desire to store descriptive data with the unsolved latent that is different from that provided for the purpose of limiting the search penetration of the Latent Cognizant repository, they may include a second Type-2 record. In either case, the first Type-2 received with the ULF flag set to "Y" will be used to add descriptors to the Unsolved Latent File. The LFIS TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.4.1.2 Latent Fingerprint Features Search (LFFS) The latent fingerprint features are extracted and transmitted along with the search criteria by the originator. The search process of the Latent Cognizant repository will be conducted and the results transmitted to the originator as described for the LFIS transaction. The fingerprint features referred to here are the native-mode fingerprint features of the FBI's AFIS; i.e., the fingerprint features information transmitted will be in a format used or accepted by AFIS/FBI. Originators may add the latent features from a features search message and, if desired, the latent fingerprint images corresponding to those features, to the Unsolved Latent File as described in Paragraph 3.4.1.1 above. Multiple- finger searches, and searches where the finger position is not known, are to be treated in the same manner as the LFIS. The originating agency must have the capability to extract and encode fingerprint features in the FBI native- mode in order to use this TOT. The LFFS TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.4.1.3 Search Results - Latent (SRL) This transaction is returned by the FBI in response to a remote latent search request. It will include a candidate list comprised of names and FBI numbers of each candidate and the corresponding fingerprint image(s) of the number of candidates specified in the NCR field of the search message. Up to 99 candidates, their match scores, and the finger positions of the images on file that matched, may be included in the response. The SRL TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 29 May 2, 2005

3.4.1.4 Unsolved Latent Match Response (ULM) This transaction is issued by IAFIS when a newly submitted criminal ten-print matches an unsolved latent case previously submitted by a state or local agency. This transaction is an unsolicited response to the sponsor of the unsolved latent fingerprint, not to the submitter of the ten-print fingerprint images. The response will include the FBI number, name, personal identifiers, and fingerprint images of the subject that was matched with the unsolved latent fingerprint and the images of the unsolved latent fingerprint. Up to 10 images can be returned in this transaction when a ten-print record hits against multiple latents in the ULF stored by a multifinger search. The "owner" of the unsolved latent case is responsible for conducting the comparison. The ULM TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.4.1.5 Latent Penetration Query (LPNQ) The Latent Penetration Query allows the user to receive a percentage of the Latent Cognizant repository that will be accessed by a latent fingerprint search. The query contains the search parameters that will be defined in either the LFIS or LFFS search request except for the Type-4 or -7 image or Type-9 features records. This will allow setting the search parameters to ensure that the maximum penetration allowed is not exceeded. Penetration tables developed by AFIS/FBI may be used as an aid to help the user determine expected penetration. This transaction applies only to a single finger even if the original transaction included multiple fingers. The LPNQ TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.4.1.6 Latent Penetration Query Response (LPNR) The response to a penetration query will contain the estimated size for the repository search based on the transaction defined characteristics. The response will indicate the percent penetration to allow further refinement of the search criteria. The LPNR TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.4.1.7 Transaction Error (ERRL) This transaction is returned by the FBI to ind icate a transaction error. It includes a message field (MSG) in dictating the type of error detected. Error responses are described in Section 3.8. The ERRL TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1.

3.4.2 Requirements for Logical Record Types Requests : The types and quantities of logical records required to submit a remote latent search request are as follows: C C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 to 2 - Type-2 Record 1 to 10 - Type-4, Type-7, or Type-9 Record each containing the image of a latent fingerprint, or the native- mode characteristics of a latent fingerprint. (Type-4 and Type-7 records may not be combined in any single search message. However, either Type-4 or Type-7 records may accompany Type-9 records in a features search message.)

Note: The Latent Penetration Query (LPNQ) does not require the Type-4 or Type-9 submission. Response: In response to a remote latent search, the following logical records will be returned: C C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record 0 - NCR Type-4 Fingerprint Image Records, where NCR is the maximum number of candidate images the user has specified in the search message (see Appendix C regarding the NCR field - 2.079). The actual number of images returned may be fewer than NCR if fewer candidates resulted in the search. For example, if user submits three fingers to be searched against the repository, specifying NCR of 7 and only 5 candidates are returned, the user will receive 5 images: the top-scoring finger from each candidate. The image of the top-scoring latent match score fingers will be returned.

The remaining candidates' fingerprints may be retrieved via a remote request for fingerprint image transaction (i.e., IRQ). For the Latent Penetration Query Response, the penetration data will be in the Type-2 record. For the Unsolved Latent Match (ULM), C C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record 1 - 10 - Type-4 record (containing the image(s) of the candidate's finger that matched the latent print) and 0 - 10 Type-4 or Type-7 record (containing the latent image from the Unsolved Latent File, if it exists in IAFIS).

The FBI's responses to latent maintenance transactions are as follows: TOT ULAR ULDR UULD ERRL RESPONSE TRANSACTION Unsolved Latent Add Confirm Response Unsolved Latent Delete Response Unsolicited Unsolved Latent Delete Latent Transaction Error

3.5.1 Type of Transaction Definitions 3.5.1.1 Unsolved Latent Record Delete Request (ULD) This TOT is used to request that unsolved latent file records be removed from the FBI's Unsolved Latent files. If a set of unsolved latent images were added from a multi- finger latent search, the ULD applies to the entire set of images added. The ULD TOT is summarized in Table E-2. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.5.1.2 Unsolved Latent Add Confirm Request (ULAC) This TOT is used to request that unsolved latent file records be semi-permanently added (since the ULF is a FIFO) to the FBI's Unsolved Latent files. This TOT must be received within fourteen days of receipt of the IAFIS response to a LFIS or LFFS transaction. If a set of unsolved latent images were added from a multi- finger latent search, the ULAC applies to the entire set of images added. The ULAC TOT is summarized in Table E-2. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.5.1.3 Unsolved Latent Add Confirm Response (ULAR) This transaction is used to provide confirmation that an unsolved latent file record has been permanently added to the FBI's Unsolved Latent files. The ULAR TOT is summarized in Table E-2. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.5.1.4 Unsolved Latent Delete Response (ULDR) This transaction is used to indicate tha t a record has been deleted from the FBI's Unsolved Latent files in response to a ULD message. The ULDR TOT is summarized in Table E-2. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.5.1.5 Unsolicited Unsolved Latent Delete (UULD) This transaction is used to indicate that a record has been deleted from the FBI's Unsolved Latent files because the FBI did not receive an Unsolved Latent Add Confirm Request (ULAC) transaction for that record within the fourteen days allowed, or because the Unsolved IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 33 May 2, 2005

Latent File (ULF) (or a particular subfile of the ULF) contained the maximum number of allowable records when an attempt was made to add a record, and the record deleted was the oldest record in the file/subfile. If a set of unsolved latent images were added from a multifinger latent search, the UULD applies to the entire set of images added. The UULD TOT is summarized in Table E-2. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.5.1.6 Reserved 3.5.1.7 Latent Transaction Error (ERRL) This transaction is returned by the FBI to indicate a transaction error. It includes a message field (MSG) indicating the type of error detected. Error responses are described in Section 3.8. The ERRL TOT is summarized in Table E-1. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.5.2 Requirements for Logical Record Types Request: The types and quantities of logical records required to submit an electronic request to perform maintenance in the Unsolved Latent Fingerprint file records are as follows: C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record.

Response: The response to an electronic request to perform maintenance in the Unsolved Latent Fingerprint file records will include the following logical records: C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record.

3.6 Remote Requests For Fingerprint Images Remote fingerprint image services include a transaction for requesting fingerprint images on file at the FBI and to request updates of existing images (see Section 3.7, Electronic Request to Update Fingerprint Images). To initiate a remote request for fingerprint image(s) from the FBI's database, the sending agency electronically transmits the FBI Number of the subject. This request will be routed to the FBI, processed, and returned to the requester through the CJIS WAN. If the requester is a local agency, the request and response will be interfaced with the CJIS WAN through the state law enforcement network. There will be no manual interve ntion on the part of the FBI. Remote requests for a set of fingerprint images will be submitted to the FBI under the TOT of "IRQ" (denoting Fingerprint Image Request) in the Type-1 Record. The FBI's response will contain a TOT of "IRR" (denoting "Image Request Response") in the Type-1 Record. The processing flow for remote image requests is illustrated in Figure 6, "Remote Fingerprint Image Request." IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 34 May 2, 2005

After completing the image retrievals and responses of a multiple set request, the FBI will respond with a Fingerprint Image Response Summary listing all requested FBI numbers and their response status. The FBI's response will contain a TOT of "ISR" in the Type-1 Record. The following TOTs are applicable for remote requests for fingerprint images: TOT IRQ TRANSACTION Fingerprint Image Request

The FBI's response to remote requests for fingerprint images is as follows: TOT IRR ISR ERRI RESPONSE TRANSACTION Fingerprint Image Request Response Fingerprint Image Response Summary Image Transaction Error

3.6.1 Type of Transaction Definitions 3.6.1.1 Fingerprint Image Request (IRQ) This transaction enables users to retrieve ten-print images from the FBI Criminal Ten-print Fingerprint Image Master File. This TOT provides for the request of fingerprint images from the FBI files so a comparison can be made by the requester at remote facilities. The requester identifies the FBI Number(s) of the subject(s) whose prints are being requested. Up to 1000 subjects' ten-print fingerprint files may be requested per transaction. Specific fingerprint images or the complete set may be requested. The transaction will be processed, and requester-selected fingerprint images on file at the FBI will be transmitted in the response. Each FBI number in the request will be addressed in a separate Image Request Response (IRR). If the request contains any errors, an Image Error Response (ERRI) will be returned including the reason for the return in a message field (MSG). Errors associated with individual FBI numbers, such as an image set not being on file, will be reported in the Fingerprint Image Response Summary (ISR). The remaining valid FBI numbers will result in individual IRR responses. The Logical Record Layout for the IRQ TOT is given in Table I-1.

3.6.1.4 Fingerprint Image Response Summary (ISR) This transaction is returned by the FBI to summarize the results of the image request processing. Each FBI number in the original request is listed, along with its related process status. Status may be image request success, invalid FBI number, or requested image(s) not on file. The Logical Record Layout for the ISR TOT is given in Table I-6. The current IAFIS implementation will drop from the list, any candidate for which there is no image and will not generate any external error condition although there is an internal indicator that there may be an out-of-sync condition. The response process is not interrupted and there is currently no other indication of such a problem in the messaging. The only external indication that an out-of-sync condition exists is that the list of returned images differs from the request. 3.6.1.5 Image Transaction Error (ERRI) This transaction is returned by the FBI to indicate a transaction error. It includes a message field (MSG) indicating the type of error detected. Error responses are described in Section 3.8. The Logical Record Layout for the ERRI TOT is given in Table I-3. 3.6.2 Requirements for Logical Record Type s Request: The types and quantities of logical records required to submit a remote fingerprint image request are as follows: C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record.

Response: The response to a remote fingerprint image request will include the following logical records: C C 1 - Type-2 1 to 14 - Type-4 Fingerprint Image Records in the IRR transaction only.

3.7 Electronic Requests To Upgrade Fingerprint Images Fingerprint image update transactions are to be used particularly by states participating in the National Fingerprint File (NFF) when they obtain fingerprints from subjects already on file that are of substantially better quality or include different characteristics than the existing ones, e.g., a new scar. The new fingerprints are submitted to the FBI for evaluation and inclusion in the FBI files. Fingerprint Image Submissions (FIS) will use a TOT of "FIS." All 14 fingerprint images must be accounted for in the update request to verify identification and finger sequence. The FBI will determine whether to update the master fingerprint images. The processing flow for IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 37 May 2, 2005

electronic requests to upgrade fingerprint images is illustrated in Figure 7, "Electronic Requests to Upgrade Fingerprint Images." The FBI's responses to fingerprint image submissions will provide upgrade results or indicate an error as follows: TOT FIS TOT FISR ERRI TRANSACTION Fingerprint Image Submission RESPONSE TRANSACTION Fingerprint Image Submission Response Image Transaction Error

3.7.1 Type of Transaction Definitions 3.7.1.1 Fingerprint Image Submission (FIS) This transaction is used to submit electronic fingerprint images that are candidates for upgrading the FBI fingerprint image files. It is intended primarily for use by NFF states when it is determined that a second or subsequent arrest provides fingerprints of significantly better quality than those previously submitted to the FBI, or when it is determined there are new fingerprint characteristics such as a scars or amputations. The transaction submits the new fingerprints to the FBI for evaluation and possible inclusion in the FBI files. All 14 fingerprints, rolled and plain, must be accounted for to verify the identification and confirm fingerprint positions. The Logical Record Layout for the FIS TOT is given in Table I-4. 3.7.1.2 Fingerprint Image Submission Response (FISR) This transaction is returned by the FBI to acknowledge a valid fingerprint image submission and specify which finger image(s) were updated. The Logical Record Layout for the FISR TOT is given in Table I-5.

Response: The response to an electronic request to update fingerprint images will include the following logical records: C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record.

3.8 Error Message Format When a transmission is rejected because data field(s) do not pass internal editing criteria, an error response will be transmitted back to the submitting agency. Each reason(s) for rejection will be detailed in the Status/Message (MSG) field. Up to eleven errors for a transaction can be recorded in the MSG field. MSG will contain an error description relating to the specific discrepancy identified. If the error is related to a field that contained invalid data, the field tag and first 30 characters of the data in the invalid field will be returned. Errors in incoming transactions can be derived of many sources. IAFIS error handling capabilities will be an evolutionary product. In its initial version, IAFIS will recognize and deal with several hundred identified error conditions. Future versions of IAFIS will develop improved capabilities that support off- nominal or error conditions. IAFIS will validate all incoming data prior to its use within the system. That is, all received and parsable fields will undergo an appropriate edit check. If any mandatory data are missing the transaction will be rejected. If any mandatory data are included but in error then an attempt will be made to correct the value manually. If any optional data are in error, the data will be ignored. The error response will be included in the ERRT, ERRA, or ERRL transaction as appropriate. The following is a non- inclusive list of the type of error messages: C C C C C C C Mandatory field missing Invalid field for transaction Field discrepancy Field out of range Request not on file Fingerprints do not allow extraction of characteristics Non-standard native mode fingerprint characteristics

Appendix M contains further details on contents of the MSG field for error conditions whose handlers have been designed to date. 3.9 Other Special Requirements For Communicating With IAFIS 3.9.1 Electronic Fingerprint Images Electronic fingerprint images must be captured and transmitted to the FBI in accordance with the standard for the electronic interchange of fingerprint information, "ANSI/NIST-ITL 1 2000, American National Standard For Information Systems - Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial, & Scar Mark & Tatoo (SMT) Information," dated July 27, 2000. 3.9.2 Fingerprint Image Compression/Decompression Algorithm IAFIS-IC-0010(V3), IAFIS Wavelet Scalar Quantization (WSQ) Grayscale Fingerprint Image Compression Specification, dated December 19, 1997 provides the definitions, requirements, and guidelines for specifying the FBI's WSQ compression algorithm. The document specifies the class of encoders required, decoder process, and coded representations for compressed image data. Latent images are not compressed. The specification provides an informative overview of the elements of the algorithm. Refer to it for details. ISO International Standard 10918-1, Information Technology - Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous Tone Still Images Part 1: Requirements and Guidelines, commonly known as the JPEG (The Joint Photographic Experts Group) algorithm has been requested for use by the UK's Home Office in submitting fingerprint images to IAFIS.

The FBI is responsible for maintaining a registry of approved compression algorithms and assigning a value to each. This value is to be used in the Type-4 Logical Record so the receiving agency can use the appropriate decompression algorithm to decode the image data. The Grayscale compression algorithm (CGA) field is a mandatory one-byte binary field used to specify the compression algorithm used (if any). A binary zero denotes no compression. The following table indicates the acceptable values for this field. The FBI expects Type-4 ten-print images to be compressed with compression algorithm type 1 (WSQ), with a nominal compression ratio of 15-to-1, and Type-10 photo images to be compressed with compression algorithm type 2 (JPEG). The table will be updated when new algorithms are approved by the FBI. Table 3-2 Compression Algorithm Values Compression Algorithm None used Wavelet Scalar Quantization (WSQ) FBI Revision 2.0 Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) 3.9.3 Fingerprint Image Quality Specifications The IAFIS Image Quality Specifications are provided in Appendix F. 3.9.4 Fingerprint Image Size Requirements The scanned fingerprint image sizes shown in the following table are consistent with standard fingerprint cards. To accommodate live-scan equipment, where the platen size can exceed these measurements, IAFIS will accept images larger than these. However, when oversize images are returned to a contributor, it is the receiver's responsibility to manage the display of these oversize images. IAFIS will enforce an upper limit on a Type-4 (i.e., Ten-Print image) record: any submissions with any Type-4 image record larger than 200 kByte will be rejected by IAFIS. Binary Value 0 1 2

3.10 Electronic Criminal Subject Photo Services Electronic criminal photo services include a transaction for requesting criminal photo sets on file at the FBI and a transaction to delete photo sets. To initiate a request for a photo set from the FBI's database, the sending agency electronically transmits the FBI number and optionally a DOA of the subject. This request will be routed by way of the CJIS WAN to the FBI, processed, and returned to the requester through the CJIS WAN. If the requester is a local agency, the request and response will be interfaced with the CJIS WAN through the state law enforcement network. There will be no manual intervention on the part of the FBI. Remote requests for a photo set will be submitted to the FBI under the TOT of "CPR" (denoting Criminal Subject Photo Request) in the Type-1 Record. The FBI's response will contain a TOT of "PRR" (denoting "Photo Request Response") in the Type-1 Record. Remote requests for the deletion of Criminal Subject Photo Sets are initiated through the CJIS WAN and returned through the same path. The request will be submitted to the FBI under the TOT of "CPD" (denoting Criminal Subject Photo Image Delete Request) in the Type-1 Record. The FBI's response will contain a TOT of "PDR" in the Type-1 Record. The following TOTs are applicable for remote request for Criminal Subject Photo Images: TOT CPR CPD TRANSACTION Criminal Subject Photo Request Criminal Subject Photo Delete Request

The FBI's response to remote requests for Criminal Subject Photo set images are as follows: TOT PRR PDR RESPONSE TRANSACTION Photo Request Response Photo Delete Response

3.10.1 Type of Transaction Definitions 3.10.1.1 Criminal Subject Photo Request (CPR) This TOT of "CPR" transaction enables users to retrieve a photo set from the FBI Criminal Photo File. Each set of photos comprises from 1 to 4 photos of a subject posed from different views. Each photo set is linked to the subject by the Date of Arrest (DOA). The transaction will be processed, and requester-selected Photo set on file at the FBI will be transmitted in the response. If the request contains any errors, the response code (REC) will be set to "N". This Response (PRR) will be returned including the reason for the rejection in a Response Explanation field (EXP). Table K-1 is the Logical Record Layout for the CPR TOT. 3.10.1.2 Criminal Subject Photo Delete Request (CPD) This TOT of "CPD" transaction enables users to delete a specific photo set associated with a DOA. Only owners of that photo set may delete it. The requester specifies the FBI number of the subject and the DOA. If the request contains any errors, the response code (REC) will be set to "N". This response (PDR) will be returned including the reason for the rejection in a Response Explanation field (EXP). Table K-2 is the Logical Record Layout for the CPD TOT. 3.10.1.3 Photo Responses There are responses for each of the requests. The TOT of "PRR" is a response for a retrieve request and the TOT of "PDR" is the response for the delete request. The two responses are handled in the same way. The transaction is returned by the FBI to indicate the condition of each request. There are two fields in this Type-2 record that give the condition of the request. If the request contains any errors that cannot be parsed: IAFIS will return an FBI=0000000; CRI= xxxxxxxxx; REC="N"; and a Response Explanation field, EXP= the translated message code of the first detected error. Tables K-3 and K-4 are the Logical Record Layouts for the "PRR" and "PDR" TOT's.

3.10.2 Requirements for Logical Record Types 3.10.2.1 Photo Request Request: The types and quant ities of logical records required to submit a criminal photo request are as follows: C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record. If the DOA is not supplied, the photo set with the latest "Date photo taken" will be sent.

Response: The response to a criminal photo request will include the following logical records: C C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 (TOT=PRR) Record 1 to 4 - Type-10 Image Records.

3.10.2.2 Photo Delete Request Request: The types and quantities of logical records required to submit a criminal photo delete request are as follows: C 1 - Type-1 Header Record C 1 - Type-2 Record.

Response: The response to a criminal photo delete request will include the following logical records: C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 (TOT=PDR) Record.

3.11 Latent Administrative Queries, Requests and Responses Two types of administrative requests can be solicited by the users to improve the efficiency of their operations. They include the Latent Repository Statistics Query (LRSQ) and Latent Search Status and Modification Query (LSMQ). LRSQ provides the users with the statistical representation of the FBI Criminal Master File used to estimate Latent Cognizant Repository search penetration. The LSMQ will allow the users to determine the status of one fingerprint search or multiple searches previously submitted by the requestor's organization. The LSMQ also allows the user to adjust priorities or search order for performing the searches, or to cancel previously submitted search requests.

The following Types of Transactions (TOTs) are included in the Latent Administrative Queries: TOT LRSQ LSMQ TRANSACTION Latent Repository Statistics Query Latent Search Status and Modification Query

The following are the responses to the above transactions: TOT LRSR LSMR ERRA RESPONSE TRANSACTION Latent Repository Statistics Response Latent Search Status and Modification Response Administrative Error Response

3.11.1 Type of Transaction Definitions 3.11.1.1 Latent Repository Statistics Query (LRSQ) The LRSQ requests the current statistics used to estimate the penetration of the Latent Cognizant Repository by a latent search based on the various input characteristics. This query will provide the users the data required to update the statistical representation used to estimate the repository penetration of a latent search without having to use the Latent Penetration Query defined in Section 3.4.1.6, above. The LRSQ TOT is summarized in Table E-2. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.11.1.2 Latent Search Status and Modification Query (LSMQ) The LSMQ requests the status of one or multiple previously submitted latent fingerprint searches, requests the priority or order of searches be cha nged, or requests searches be canceled. Reprioritization cannot be requested in the same message as either reordering or cancellation of searches, and should be requested if needed before reordering or cancellation. If the same message is used to both reorder and cancel searches, the entire reorder operation will be performed first, followed by the canceling operation. Therefore, if the canceled search date/time stamp is desired to be retained and exchanged with another search, the canceled search must be listed with the reordered searches as well as in the field listing searches to be canceled. To determine the current status of searches, the user will submit the case number(s) and extension(s) of the fingerprint search(es). The IAFIS response will include the AFIS segment process control number (SCNA) of the referenced search(es) and the estimated time(s) to complete the search(es). The LSMQ TOT is summarized in Table E-2. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. For LSMQ information on multiple searches, the requester can define the depth of the query to be at the State level (defined as "S" in Field 2.004 (Query Depth of Detail (QDD)) in Table E-27); it will include all ORIs, all associated Case Numbers, and all associated Case IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 46 May 2, 2005

Extension Numbers. The request can also be at the ORI level (defined as "O") including all Case Numbers and associated Extensions for a particular ORI, or at the Case level (defined as "C") including the case number and all associated Extensio ns. The response will include the segment control numbers and estimated times to complete for all requested submittals. This transaction can also be used to change the priority of previously submitted searches (see definition of PRI in Appendix C). This request will list the segment control numbers of the searches (determined by previous status query) and their new priorities. In addition, the LSMQ provides the capability to change the order in which the requested searches are processed. A modified rank order of these searches is submitted by including the SCNA of each search in the order in which they are to be searched. AFIS/FBI will reorganize its queue for the requestor for all searches that have not been completed or not currently being processed (i.e., only those searches still pending). Finally, the LSMQ provides the capability to cancel a previously submitted search request by including the Cancel Fingerprint Search field the SCNA of any search to be canceled. 3.11.1.3 Latent Repository Statistics Response (LRSR) LRSR to the LRSQ will provide the users the data required to update the statistical representation used to estimate the repository penetration of a latent search. The LRSR TOT is summarized in Table E-2. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.11.1.4 Latent Search Status and Modification Response (LSMR) The LSMR will provide the users with the list of previously submitted searches ranked in order for processing and their associated priorities in response to the request. A search already in progress will not be preempted. The LSMR will include the AFIS segment control number(s) (SCNA) of the referenced search(es) and the estimated time to complete the search(es). The LSMR will also provide no tification that IAFIS has processed the cancellations. The SCNA of each search canceled will be returned in the CFS field. The LSMR TOT is summarized in Table E-2. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.11.1.5 Administrative Transaction Error (ERRA) This transaction is returned by the FBI to indicate a transaction error. It includes a message field (MSG) indicating the type of error detected. Error responses are described in Section 3.8. The ERRA (Administrative) TOT is summarized in Table E-2. Edit specifications for the fields it uses may be found in Table C-1. 3.11.2 Requirements for Logical Record Types Request: The types and quantities of logical records required to submit a latent administrative query are as follows: C C 1 - Type-1 Header Record 1 - Type-2 Record.

APPENDIX A TRANSACTION PRIORITIES

Incoming electronic transactions to IAFIS must have a means to identify the required priority. The ANSI standard establishes four priority levels in the Transaction Priority (PRY) field of the Type-1 record. The EFTS will use this field to identify the relative processing priority of incoming transactions (Level 1 is highest priority). The assignment of priorities will be as follows: Table A-1. Priorities Level 1  Urgent 2 hour average response CAR1 TPIS TPFS TPRS7 CNA Level 2  Routine 24 hour average response NFAP 7 FANC FAUF NFUF MAP LFIS4 LPNQ LRSQ LSMQ LFFS4 CFS4 ELR4 MCS4 LFS4 AMN DEU DEK MPR FIS2 IRQ 5 ULD ULAC Level 3  Secondary Over 24 hour response IRQ 6 CPD CPR Level 4 Test/Training test and training response TBR

Reserved. Ten-print fingerprint data files shall be updated within 2 hours of the update decision. Reserved. Latent submission responses and latent remote search responses shall be transmitted within 1 day after initiation of search on IAFIS. Latent responses (i.e., LSR, NAR, ULM) for electronic submissions and remote responses (i.e., SLR) will be transmitted for the latent searches shown above. The response time for retrieval of 100 fingerprint images or less shall not exceed one day. The response is transmitted in individual messages. The response time for retrieval of 101 to 1000 fingerprint image sets may exceed 24 hours. The response is transmitted in individual messages. For limited use.

Reassignment of priorities may be made based on workload conditions and special processing requests. Reassignment has no effect if IAFIS is not busy. An example of a valid reassignment would be a Criminal Ten-Print Submission (No Answer Necessary) transaction that is normally a 24-hour turnaround but can be reassigned (or submitted at higher priority) to Level 3 because the contributor is not affected. Additionally, urgent Level 2's may be received, in which case they are reassigned to Level 1, for such cases as certain AMN or special unknown deceased.

APPENDIX B DESCRIPTORS AND FIELD EDIT SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPE-1 LOGICAL RECORDS

The following paragraphs describe the data contained in fields for the Type-1 logical record. Each field shall begin with the number of the record type, followed by a period, followed by the appropriate field number, followed by a colon. Multiple information items within a field R or subfield shall be separated by the U S separator, multiple subfields shall be separated by the S G separator, and information fields shall be separated by the S separator. Immediately following the last information field in the Type-1 logical record, an F S separator character shall be used to separate it from the next logical record. The information in this Appendix has been taken directly from the ANSI Standard, Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial & Scar Mark & Tatoo (SMT) Information (ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000). Any information that is underlined is the FBI-specific requirements. CNT 1.03 - File content. This mandatory field shall list each of the logical records in the logical file by record type. It also specifies the order in which the remaining logical records shall appear in the logical file. It shall consist of one or more subfields. Each subfield shall contain two information items describing a single logical record found in the current logical file. The subfields shall be entered in the same order in which the logical records shall be transmitted. When more than one subfield is used, the RS separator character shall be entered between the subfields. With the addition of the Type-10 record, the first information item of each subfield may now be a one- or two-digit integer (giving the logical record type.) The remaining edit specifications pertaining to CNT are unchanged. The first subfield shall relate to this Type-1 transaction record. The first information item within this subfield shall be the single character indicating that this is a Type-1 record consisting of header information (the numeral "1" selected from the ANSI Standard Table 1). The second information item of this subfield shall be the sum of the Type-2 plus Type-3 plus Type-4 plus Type-5 plus Type-6 plus Type-7 plus Type-8 plus Type-9 plus Type-10 records contained in this logical file. This number is also equal to the count of the remaining subfields of Field 1.03. The U S separator character shall be entered between the first and second information items. The remaining subfields of Field 1.03 pertaining to Type-2, Type-3, Type-4, Type-5, Type-6, Type-7, Type-8, Type-9 and Type-10 records contained in the file shall each be comprised of two information items. The first information item shall be one or two characters chosen from one of the following: the ANSI Standard Table 1 that states the record type. The second information item shall be the IDC associated with the logical record pertaining to that subfield. The IDC shall be a positive integer equal to or greater than zero. The U S character shall be used to separate the two information items. (Only Type-1, Type-2, Type-4, Type-7, Type-9 and Type-10 records will be accepted by the FBI.)

DAI 1.07 - Destination Agency Identifier. This mandatory field shall contain the identifier of the administration or organization designated to receive the transmission. The size and data content of this field shall be defined by the user and be in accordance with the receiving agency. This field shall be a nine-byte alphanumeric field. DAT 1.05 - Date. This mandatory field shall contain the date that the transaction was initiated. The date shall appear as eight digits in the format CCYYMMDD. The CCYY characters shall represent the year of the transaction; the MM characters shall be the tens and units values of the month; and the DD characters shall be the day in the month. For example, 19920601 represents June 1, 1992. The complete date shall not exceed the current date. LEN 1.01 - Logical Record Length. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the total count of the number of bytes in this Type-1 logical record. Field 1.01 shall begin with "1.01:", followed by the length of the record including every character of every field contained in the record and the information separators. The number of characters added to the record by the LEN field itself shall be included in calculating the value of LEN. NSR 1.11 - Native Scanning Resolution. This mandatory field shall specify the nominal scanning resolution of the AFIS or other image capture device supported by the originator of the transmission. This field permits the recipient of this transaction to send respond data at a transmitting resolution tailored to the NSR (if it is able to do so) or to the minimum scanning resolution. This field shall contain five bytes specifying the native scanning resolution in pixels per millimeter. The resolution shall be expressed as two numeric characters followed by a decimal point and two more numeric characters (e.g., 20.00). This field is needed because the interchange of fingerprint information between systems of the same manufacturer may, in some instances, be more efficiently done at a transmitting resolution equal to the native scanning resolution of the system rather than at the minimum scanning resolution specified in this standard. This field applies only to fingerprint image data. For those logical files that contain only Type-10 image records, this field shall be set to "00.00". NTR 1.12 - Nominal transmitting Resolution. This mandatory field shall specify the nominal transmitting resolution for the image or images being transmitted. This field shall contain five bytes specifying the transmitting resolution in pixels per millimeter. The resolution shall be expressed as two numeric characters followed by a decimal point and two more numeric characters (e.g., 20.00). The transmitting resolution shall be within the range specified by the transmitting resolution requirement. This field applies only to fingerprint image data. For those logical files that contain only Type-10 image records, this field shall be set to "00.00". ORI 1.08 - Originating Agency Identifier. This mandatory field shall contain the identifier of the administration or organization originating the transaction. The size and data content of this field shall be defined by the user and be in accordance with criteria specified by the receiving agency. For EFTS purposes, this field sha ll be a nine-byte alphanumeric field. The first two characters shall be a valid POB code, and the entire ORI shall validate to an NCIC-authorized ORI. Note: In a submission to the FBI, the submitting agency (usually the State CTA) is the ORI and the FBI is the DAI, while the FBI's response to the submission will show the FBI as

IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1

May 2, 2005

the ORI and the submitting agency as the DAI. (See also Appendix C for the definition of CRI.). PRY 1.06 - Transaction Priority. When this field is used, it shall contain a single information character to designate the urgency with which a response is desired. The values shall range from 1 to 4, with "1" denoting the highest priority. The default value shall be "4" if no value is indicated. TCN 1.09 - Transaction Control Number. This mandatory field shall contain the Transaction Control Number as assigned by the originating agency. A unique control identifier shall be assigned to each transaction. For any transaction that requires a response, the respondent shall refer to this identifier in communicating with the originating agency. This field shall be a ten-toforty byte alphanumeric-special (ANS) field. TCR 1.10 - Transaction Control Reference. This field shall be used in responses only to refer to the Transaction Control Number of a previous transaction involving an inquiry or other action that required a response. This field is mandatory for such responses. This field shall be a tento-forty byte alphanumeric-special (ANS) field. TOT 1.04 - Type of Transaction. This mandatory field shall contain an identifier, designating the type of transaction and subsequent processing that this logical file should be given. VER 1.02 - Version Number. This mandatory four-byte ASCII field shall be used to specify the version number of the ANSI Standard for Information Systems, ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000, Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial ,& Scar Mark & Tatoo (SMT) Information, implemented by the software or system creating the file. The format of this field shall consist of four numeric characters. The first two characters shall specify the major version number. The last two characters shall be used to specify the minor revision number. The initial revision number for a version shall be "00". The entry in this field for this 1993 approved standard shall be "0200". The original 1986 standard would be considered the first version or "0100". With the addition of the Type-10 logical record by the Addendum to the ANSI Standard, Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial & SMT Information (ANSI/NIST-ITL 1a-1997), the entry in this field shall be "0201."

APPENDIX C DESCRIPTORS AND FIELD EDIT SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPE-2 LOGICAL RECORDS

1.0 User-Defined Data Some Type-2 elements have their origins as contributor-supplied data. User-defined data is that subset of contributor-supplied data that will not be stored in any IAFIS files for later search or retrieval purposes. User-defined data will not be validated (with several exceptions), and therefore may in general consist of any printable 7-bit ASCII character: i.e. free text . This includes the ASCII (decimal) codes 07 (BEL) through 13 (CR) and 32 (SP) through 127 (DEL), inclusive. Separator characters are not part of the printable character set. The following list gives those Type-2 elements, which the FBI treats as being userdefined: ATN, SCO, OCA, SID, OCP, EAD, RES, CRI, IMA, TAA. In this list, SID and CRI may not always be free-text. In criminal transactions, these fields must contain valid formats, as specified further in this appendix. Occasional other restrictions are specified as required in this data dictionary. If the contributor supplies data in any of these fields in a submission or search, that data will be returned in the corresponding response. The RAP, RET, REC, TAA, and ULF are flag fields taking values positive = "Y" and negative = "N". The negative value should not, in general, be submitted unless otherwise described in a specific definition. 1.2 Date Fields EFTS transactions will be Y2K compliant. Date fields are in accordance with that requirement. In general, the format for date fields is the following: A date is shown as an 8-digit numeric field of the format CCYYMMDD, where CC (Century) must be 19 or 20 YY (Year) must be 00 to 99 MM (Month) must be 01 to 12 DD (Day) must be 01 to the limit defined by the month and year (e.g., DD may be 29 for MM = 02 in Leap Years) For example 19921201 represents December 1, 1992. Since dates find a variety of uses in EFTS transactions, each use may have specific format restrictions or special edits. For specific format restrictions or special edits, see the individual date field entries in this Appendix. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 C-1 May 2, 2005

2.0 Data Dictionary ACN 2.071 - ACTION TO BE TAKEN . This field is used to include text answers to submission requests to indicate that a latent case will be established or to indicate recommendations for further actions in either latent or ten-print responses. Commas, hyphens, ampersands, slashes, number signs, and blanks are all allowed as special characters. AGR 2.023 - AGE RANGE. An estimated age range may be entered using a pair of two-digit numbers. The first two digits shall represent the minimum age, and the second two the maximum. There shall be no separator character used between the ages. AKA 2.019 - ALIASES. This 3-to-30 alpha-numeric special (ANS) field contains alias names of the subject. Up to ten aliases may be provided, separated from one another by the R S character. AKA may contain a comma, hyphen, or blank as special characters. The format shall be the surname followed by a comma (,), followed by the given name(s) separated by a space. The following restrictions and exceptions to the general format apply: 1. Minimum length is three bytes in the following sequence: alpha or ampersand, comma, alpha. 2. A comma must be followed by the minimum of one alpha character. 3. Blank before or after comma is invalid. 4. Hyphen in first and last position of any name segment is invalid. 5. Two consecutive blanks or hyphens between characters are invalid.

AMP 2.084 - AMPUTATED OR BANDAGED. This grouped field contains information about amputated or bandaged fingerprints in an EFTS submission. It is comprised of two subfields, Finger Number (FGP), and Amputated Or Bandaged Code ( AMPCD ). The two-character finger position code is followed by the U S separator and the amputated or bandaged code. Multiple fingers shall be separated by the R S separator. This field is to be used anytime there are fewer than ten printable fingers in a ten-print submission. A partially scarred finger should be printed. If the forwarding agency is not sure of the reason a finger's image is missing (for example, when the arresting agency did not specify a reason in its submission to the State Ident Bureau), the "UP" code should be used. Two characters represent each finger number as follows: Finger Position Right thumb Right index Right middle Right ring Right little FGP 01 02 03 04 05

ASL 2.047- ARREST SEGMENT LITERAL. This field is made up of the Date of Offense (DOO) and the Arrest Offense Literal ( AOL). The AOL is free text description of an offense charged on an arrest. The first character of the AOL text must not be blank. Each AOL should have a corresponding date (DOO), if available. The DOO shall appear as an eight-digit number as specified in Section 1.2 of this Appendix. The DOO shall not exceed the current date, except when the submission originates from an international contributor located in a time zone earlier than the Eastern Time Zone. This date field shall contain the local date for the region submitting the request. Edit checks on the IAFIS will accept the local date as valid up to 1 day forward (24 hours), in order to accommodate the variance between international time zones. Up to 40 occurrences of the ASL are allowed. Each occurrence of the ASL shall be separated by the R S separator character. The DOO shall be separated from the AOL by the U S separator character. A DOO is prohibited without a corresponding AOL offense. If a DOO is not present, a U S character separator shall still be used. The following is an example of more than one occurrence of the AOL field using DOO:
R U G 2.047:19940915 U S DUI S 19940920 S POSSESSION OF FIREARMS S

ATN 2.006 - "ATTENTION" INDICATOR. This alphanumeric-special field shall contain a designation of the individual to whose attention a response is to be directed. Periods shall not be used (e.g., Det. J. Q. Public shall be entered as DET J Q PUBLIC). The value of ATN returned to the submitter is the value submitted. CAN 2.064- CANDIDATE LIST. This grouped field shall contain a candidate list. It is comprised of two subfields: FBI number ( FNU), and Name (NAM ), separated by a U S separator, will be provided for each candidate in the list. Commas, hyphens and blanks are allowed in the NAM subfield, as specified in the NCIC Code Manual. Each FBI number and name set shall be separated from the next by the R S separator character.

CFS 2.077 - CANCEL FINGERPRINT SEARCH. This field will contain the information required to cancel a latent FP search previously submitted to IAFIS. This field will contain unique identifier numbers (AFIS/FBI uses the AFIS Segment Process Control Number) for all searches to be canceled. The response to this request will contain the same information for all searches that were canceled. Only searches which are still pending will be canceled (searches completed or in-progress may not be canceled). CIN 2.010 - CONTRIBUTOR CASE IDENTIFIER NUMBER. This grouped free-text field is a 48-byte (maximum) alphanumeric-special assigned by the contributor to uniquely identify a latent case. It consists of a literal subfield Contributor Case Prefix ( CIN_PRE) of up to 24 characters (e.g., "Incident #", "Laboratory Number:", "Investigation No."), followed by the U S separator and the Contributor Case Identifier subfield (CIN_ID ) of up to 24 characters. CIX 2.011 - CONTRIBUTOR CASE IDENTIFIER EXTENSION. This field is a two-byte to four-byte numeric supplement to the Case Identifier Number that allows multiple searches to be associated with the same case. The CIX shall be used only in conjunction with the CIN . CRI 2.073 - CONTROLLING AGENCY IDENTIFIER. In Criminal and Civil transactions, the first instance of this field shall contain the originating agency identifier (ORI) of the organization controlling the transaction when that organization is different than the one submitting the transaction (e.g. state CTA). When the controlling agency has the same ORI as the CTA, both the ORI and CRI fields shall be submitted with the same identifier. In criminal transactions, the CRI will usually refer to the booking station that has submitted the subject's fingerprint card or photo to be transmitted through the CTA to the FBI. For Civil submissions, this field may be user defined in accordance with predefined parameters and must be validated through the field specification edits and the format of an NCIC authorized ORI. The FBI uses the first instance of CRI in any transaction that would modify criminal records as the authority to do so. If in a Civil transaction there is a criminal IDENT against the subject and the first instance of the submitted CRI is not an authorized ORI, the ORI of the State Ident Bureau that submitted the transaction will be used in its stead. The second and third instances of CRI, when sent, are treated as user defined fields. (See also Appendix B for definitions of ORI and DAI.) CRI returned is otherwise the same as was submitted unless the sub mitting agency has used a deleted or retired CRI, in which case its replacement will be used. For EFTS purposes, this field shall be a nine-byte alphanumeric field. The first two characters shall be a valid alpha-character POB code, which represents the state or country in which the agency is located, and the entire CRI shall validate to an NCIC-authorized ORI. For Federal agencies, the first two characters should coincide with its respective headquarters or office ORI. If an agency is submitting for an entity outside of its respective state, the channeling agency need only ensure that submitted CRIs represent valid ORIs that have been added to the IAFIS Computerized Contributor Address file. CRN 2.085 - CIVIL RECORD NUMBER. A unique identifier assigned to each Civil Subject Record.

FBI - 2.014 FBI NUMBER. This field contains the subject's FBI number, if known. A valid FBI number shall be no more than nine alphanumeric characters. The FBI number returned in a response is dependent upon the search results (see Section 3.6). FFN - 2.003 FBI FILE NUMBER. This is a 10-byte numeric representing the FBI Investigative File Number. This is not the FBI Number specified by the mnemonic "FBI." Since it is used for FBI LFPS record keeping purposes, it is imperative that the remote user transmit this number if it is known. FGP 2.074 - FINGER POSITION. This field is used for latent submissions and remote searches and contains the fingerprint position code of the latent print(s) submitted. The following table is the finger position and code table: Finger Position Unknown or "ALL" Right thumb Right index Right middle Right ring Right little Left thumb Left index Left middle Left ring Left little Code 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10

If more than one finger is submitted then the codes will be separated by the R S character separator. For remote latent searches, if multiple fingerprint images are included in one search, finger position is mandatory for all images. If finger position is unknown, the search may contain only a single image, and the field FGP will be omitted, or may contain multiple guesses at the correct finger position in the FGP field. In this case the PAT field must contain "00" in its Finger Number subfield to indicate that the actual position is unknown (see also PAT entry). IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 C-7 May 2, 2005

REC 2.082 - RESPONSE CODE. A one-byte alpha field with allowable values of "Y" or "N". This field is used in the PDR and PRR transactions to indicate the status of the corresponding

request. If the request contains any errors, the response code (REC) will be set to "N". Otherwise it will be set to "Y". RES 2.041 - RESIDENCE OF PERSON FINGERPRINTED. The subject's residential address may be entered in this field as free text, including printable special characters and formatting characters (CR, LF, TAB). The RES returned in a response is the same as the one submitted. RET 2.005 - RETENTION CODE. This is an alpha field indicating whether the arrest information submitted as a part of a transaction (either electronic or hard copy) is to be retained as a permanent part of the FBI's Criminal Master File. Submit a "Y" for yes, an "N" for no. For Civil submissions, RET is used to indicate whether the civil submission is to be retained in the civil files. In the case where a Criminal Ident was made against the Criminal File in a Civil Submission (irrespective of the value of RET), under some conditions the record is retained as a Civil Cycle in that Criminal record. RFP 2.037 - REASON FINGERPRINTED. This alphanumeric-special field is used to indicate the purpose of a civil or applicant fingerprint card submission. This field will indicate if the card is submitted for licensing, gun permit, or criminal justice employment, non-criminal justice employment, adoption, naturalization, volunteer background checks, or gaming certification. Commas, blanks, dashes, hyphens and slashes are all allowed as special characters. RSR 2.065 - REPOSITORY STATISTICS RESPONSE. This field contains a file generated by the AFIS that provides the detailed statistics that can be used to estimate the level of IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 C-18 May 2, 2005

penetration of the repository given a set of search parameters defined in the search request. This field is in the form of a large ASCII file that can contain up to 32000 bytes of alphanumericspecial (ANS) data. The file has three fields containing: (1) a parameter name, (2) a parameter value; and (3) the fraction of the file having that value of the parameter. The fields are TAB delimited. NEWLINE characters separate records. A period character is used as a decimal point in the Fraction field. As an example, the record EYE<TAB>BLUE<TAB>0.321<NEWLINE> indicates that the parameter EYE having the value BLU occurs in 32.1% of the subjects on file. SCNA 2.086 - AFIS SEGMENT CONTROL NUMBER. This field contains a number used by AFIS/FBI to allow tracking of or reference to specific transactions. It is used, for example, to indicate the index number for individual records in the IAFIS Unsolved Latent File in the response to a Remote Latent Search. It is also used to refer to transactions that contained searches for the purpose of status queries, modifications, or cancellations. SCO 2.007- SEND COPY TO. The purpose of this 9-to-19 character alphanumeric-special (ANS) field is to indicate that additional electronic responses need to be forwarded to agencies other than the contributor by the state identification bureau. The first nine characters shall be alphanumeric and shall contain the NCIC-assigned Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) for an agency who is to receive a copy of the response. At the option of the transmitting agency, the ORI may be expanded to a size of 19 characters, with 10 characters of alphanumeric-special (ANS) data appended to the end to assist in proper routing of the responses. However, no <US> or <RS> separator may be used between the ORI and routing extension (use any printable ASCII special character (e.g., a slash) as a separator). Upon receiving an electronic response, the state identification bureau will forward a copy of the electronic response to each agency listed in the "SEND COPY TO" block. SEX 2.024- SEX. This field is used to report the gender of the subject. The entry is a single character selected from the following table: If Following Condition Exists Subject's gender reported as female Occupation or charge indicated "Male Impersonator" Subject's gender reported as male Occupation or charge indicated "Female Impersonator" or transvestite Male name, no gender given Female name, no gender given Unknown gender Enter Code F G M N Y Z X

SID 2.015 - STATE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. This field contains any known state identification number. The format is the standard two-character abbreviation of the state name, followed by the number. Embedded blanks are not permitted. SIDs from NY, OR, or PA may contain a hyphen in the last position. The SID returned in a response is dependent upon the search results (see Section 3.6). IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 C-19 May 2, 2005

SMT 2.026 - SCARS, MARKS AND TATTOOS. For each scar, mark, or tattoo present on the subject, the appropriate NCIC code shall be used in this information item. Blanks are allowed as special characters. SOC 2.016 - SOCIAL SECURITY ACCOUNT NUMBER. This field contains the subject's social security number, if known. This number shall be entered as nine consecutive digits with no embedded punctuation characters. No foreign social security numbers shall be used. SRF 2.059 - SEARCH RESULTS FINDINGS. This field is used in responses to submissions and contains a single character. An "I" shall be used to indicate that an identification has been made, and an "N" shall be used to indicate that no identification has been made. TAA 2.087 - TREAT AS ADULT. A one-byte optional field to indicate whether a juvenile is to be processed as an adult. A "Y" indicates yes, an omitted field indicates no. The TAA returned in a response is the same as the one submitted. TSR 2.043 - TYPE OF SEARCH REQUESTED. A one-byte code shall be entered in this field from the following table to indicate the type of record being submitted. The field is applicable to the FAUF and NFUF transactions as follows. Type of Record Code Applicable Type of Transaction

Pre-commission candidate record with fingerprints Civil submission in support of the National Child Protection Act of 1993

P

FAUF/NFUF

V

NFUF*

* When submitting fingerprints using TSR of V, the contributing agency should specify either the VCA/NCPA or a state statute in the RFP Field. To be charged at the volunteer rate, the word "volunteer" must appear with or without the statute. ULF 2.083 - UNSOLVED LATENT FILE. This one-character alpha field is used to designate whether a latent image or features record in search should be added to the Unsolved Latent File. Submit a "Y" for yes. For a no, omit the field. WGT 2.029 - WEIGHT. In this field the subject's weight in pounds is entered. If weight is unknown, 000 is entered. All weights in excess of 499 pounds will be set to 499 lbs. WTR 2.030 - WEIGHT RANGE. If a range of weight is given, it shall be expressed as two 3-digit numbers indicating the minimum and maximum weights (in pounds) of the subject. There shall be no separator character used between the weights. WTR must be in the range 050 to 499 lbs (however, there is no minimum range limit for missing persons or unknown persons).

APPENDIX D LOGICAL RECORD LAYOUTS FOR TYPE-TWO (TEN-PRINT)

1.0 INTRODUCTION Appendix D presents logical record layouts for Ten-Print transactions. The CAR and SRE transactions are presented in detail by Tables D-1 and D-2, respectively. Table D-3 is a summary representation of all Ten-Print transactions. Notes for Tables D-1 through D-3 are given in Table D-4. For detailed specifications of individual fields of these recordsets, see Appendix C. 2.0 INTERPRETATION OF TABLE D-3 Table D-3 summarizes what formerly required 15 tables in Appendix D. The column headers at the top of the page select a particular transaction. The row headers in the left margin give the tag number and ID for each field. The cell at the intersection of any given row and column gives summary information about the use of that field (row) in that transaction (column). If that cell is blank, the field is not used in that record. Otherwise, the number at the right in the cell gives the maximum number of occurrences of that field for that record. If the cell is shaded, then the field's inclusion is optional for that record; unshaded cells indicate mandatory inclusion. In all cases, the minimum number of occurrences for a mandatory field is one, and zero for an optional field. Finally, the superscripts in the upper left-hand corner of the cell is a reference to any note (Table D-4) pertaining to the use of that field in the record. NOTE: The remarks about the interpretation of Table D-3 also apply to Table E-1 and E 2.

These fields, however, must be, submitted with formatted information. FBI number must be present if known for inquiry prints. Field is mandatory if fingerprint submission is from an NFF State. This field is mandatory if any finger is either amputated or rolled impression was not made.

APPENDIX F IAFIS IMAGE QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS

1.0 SCOPE AND PURPOSE These specifications apply to: (1) systems which scan and capture fingerprints4 in digital, softcopy form, including hardcopy scanners such as ten-print card scanners, and live scan devices, altogether called `fingerprint scanners'; and (2) systems utilizing a printer to print digital fingerprint images to hardcopy, called `fingerprint printers'. These specifications provide criteria for insuring the image quality of fingerprint scanners and printers that input fingerprint images to, or generate fingerprint images from within, the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS). Digital softcopy images obtained from fingerprint scanners must have sufficient quality to allow the following functions to be performed: (l) conclusive fingerprint comparisons (identification or non- identification decision); (2) fingerprint classification; (3) automatic feature detection; and (4) overall Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) search reliability. The fingerprint comparison process requires a high fidelity image. Finer detail, such as pores and incipient ridges, are needed because they can play an important role in the comparison. The fingerprint examiners in the IAFIS environment will depend upon softcopy displayed images of scanned fingerprints to make comparisons, but will also need to accept and utilize hardcopy images in certain instances. For example, some contributors may print cards from live scan or card scan systems for submission to the FBI. These hardcopy prints will be obtained from printers that include printing algorithms optimized for fingerprints. The printer's principle function is to produce life-size prints of digital fingerprints that have met IAFIS format requirements, and provide sufficient print quality to support fingerprint comparisons, i.e., support identification or non-identification decisions. The image quality requirements covered in the following sections 2 and 3 for fingerprint scanners, section 4 for fingerprint printers, and section 5 for Fast-Track requirements, have associated test procedures that are described in detail in [Test Procedures]. These test procedures will be used by the FBI principally for certification of fingerprint systems; they may also be used in acceptance testing, and in performance capability demonstrations, as an indication of capability to perform. Equipment shall be tested to meet the requirements in normal operating modes, e.g., scanners shall not be tested at slower than normal operating speeds in an attempt to meet geometric accuracy specifications. A vendor may recommend alternate testing methods if the test procedures given in this Appendix are not applicable or cannot be applied to the particular system under test.

The term `fingerprint' in this Appendix may also include palmprint, whole hand print, or a print from other parts of the human body. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 F-1 May 2, 2005

2.0 FINGERPRINT SCANNER The fingerprint scanner must be capable of producing images that exhibit good geometric fidelity, sharpness, detail rendition, gray- level uniformity, and gray-scale dynamic range, with low noise characteristics. The images must be true representations of the input fingerprints, without creating any significant artifacts, anomalies, false detail, or cosmetic image restoration effects. The scanner's final output resolution, in both sensor detector row and column directions, shall be in the range: (R­0.01R) to (R+0.01R) and shall be gray- level quantized to 8 bits per pixel (256 gray- levels). The magnitude of "R" is either 500 pixels per inch (ppi) or 1000 ppi; a scanner may be certified at either one, or both, of these resolution levels. The scanner's true optical resolution shall be greater than or equal to R. A scanner intended to scan standard 8.0 by 8.0 inch ten-print cards, e.g., applicant fingerprint card type FD-258 or FD-249, shall be capable of capturing an area of at least 5.0 by 8.0 inches, which captures all 14 printblocks, either each printblock as a separate image, or all printblocks together as a single image. Table 2-1 gives the preferred capture sizes, applicable to both card scan and live scan systems. Scanner capture dimensions should never be less than 90% of those given in Table 2-1, with the exception that when scanning fingerprint cards, the card form dimensions take precedence. Maximum capture sizes may be found in [EFTS] and [ANSI/NIST].

* Live scanner must be capable of capturing at least 80% of full roll arc length, where full roll arc length is defined as arc length from nail edge-to-nail edge.

2.1 Linearity Requirement: When measuring a stepped series of uniform target reflectance patches (e.g., step tablet) that substantially cover the scanner's gray range, the average value of each patch shall be within 7.65 gray- levels of a linear, least squares regression line fitted between targe t reflectance patch values (independent variable) and scanner output gray- levels (dependent variable). Background : All targets used in IQS compliance verification are expected to be scanned with the scanner operating in a linear input/output mode. Linearity enables valid comparisons of test measurements with requirements, e.g., a system's spatial frequency response in terms of Modulation Transfer Function is, strictly speaking, a linear systems concept. Linearity also facilitates comparisons between different scanners through the `common ground' concept. In atypical cases, a small amount of smooth, monotonic nonlinearity may be acceptable for the test target scans, i.e., when it is substantially impractical and unrepresentative of operational use, to force linearity on the scanner under test (e.g., some livescan devices). Linearity is not a requirement for the operational or test fingerprint scans, which allows for processing flexibility to overcome inadequate tonal characteristics of fingerprint samp les.

2.2 Geometric Accuracy Requirement (across-bar) When scanning a multiple, parallel bar target, in both vertical bar and horizontal bar orientations, the absolute value of the difference between the actual distance across parallel target bars, and the corresponding distance measured in the image, shall not exceed the following values, for at least 99.0% of the tested cases in each printblock measurement area and in each of the two orthogonal directions. for 500 ppi scanner: D = 0.0007, D = 0.01X, for 1000 ppi scanner: D = 0.0005,

for 0.00 < X = 0.07 for 0.07 = X = 1.50

for 0.00 < X = 0.07

D= 0.0071X, for 0.07 = X = 1.5 where: D = |Y-X| X = actual target distance Y = measured image distance D, X, Y are in inches Requirement (along-bar): When scanning a multiple, parallel bar target, in both vertical bar and horizontal bar orientations, the maximum difference in the horizontal or vertical direction, respectively, between the locations of any two points within a 1.5 inch segment of a given bar image, shall not exceed 0.016 inches for at least 99.0% of the tested cases in each printblock measurement area and in each of the two orthogonal directions. Background : In this section 2.2, the phrase: multiple, parallel bar target refers to a Ronchi target, which consists of an equal- width bar and space square wave pattern at 1.0 cy/mm, with high contrast ratio and fine edge definition. This target is also used to verify compliance with the scanner resolution requirement given in section 2.0. Across-bar geometric accuracy is measured across the imaged Ronchi target bars that substantially cover the total image capture area. The 500 ppi requirement corresponds to a positional accuracy of ± 1.0% for distances between 0.07 and 1.5 inches, and a constant ± 0.0007 inches (1/3 pixel) for distances less than or equal to 0.07 inches. The 1000 ppi requirement corresponds to a positional accuracy of ± 0.71% for distances between 0.07 and 1.5 inches, and a constant ± 0.0005 inches (1/2 pixel) for distances less than or equal to 0.07 inches.

IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1

May 2, 2005

This measurement procedure is also used to verify the ppi resolution requirement given in section 2.0. Along-bar geometric accuracy is measured along the length of an individua l Ronchi target bar in the image. For a given horizontal bar, for example, the maximum difference between bar center locations (in vertical direction), determined from bar locations measured at multiple points along a 1.5" bar segment length, is compared to the maximum allowable difference requirement (analogously for vertical bar). This requirement is to ensure that pincushion or barrel distortion over the primary area of interest, i.e., a single fingerprint, is not too large. 2.3 Spatial Frequency Response Requirements: The spatial frequency response shall be measured using a continuous tone sine wave target, denoted as Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) measurement, unless the scanner cannot obtain adequate tonal response from this target, in which case a bi-tonal bar target shall be used to measure the spatial frequency response, denoted as Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) measurement. When measuring the sine wave MTF, it shall meet or exceed the minimum modulation values given in Table 2-1, in both the detector row and detector column directions, and over any region of the scanner's field of view. When measuring the bar CTF, it shall meet or exceed the minimum modulation values defined by equation 2-1 or equation 2-2 (whichever applies), in both the detector row and detector column directions, and over any region of the scanner's field of view. CTF values computed from equations 2-1 and 2-2 for nominal test frequencies are given in Table 2-2. None of the MTF or CTF modulation values measured at specification spatial frequencies shall exceed 1.05. The output sine wave image or bar target image shall not exhibit any significant amount of aliasing.

It is not required that the bar target contain the exact frequencies listed in Table 2-2; however, the target does need to cover the listed frequency range, and contain bar patterns close to each of the listed frequencies. The following equations are used to obtain the specification CTF modulation values when using bar targets that contain frequencies not listed in Table 2-2. 500 ppi scanner, for f = 1.0 to 10.0 cy/mm: CTF = 3.04105E - 04 * f 2 - 7.99095E - 02 * f + 1.02774 1000 ppi scanner, for f = 1.0 to 20.0 cy/mm: CTF = -1.85487E - 05 * f 3 + 1.41666E - 03 * f 2 - 5.73701E - 02 * f + 1.01341

(eq.2 - 1)

(eq.2 - 2)

Background : For MTF assessment, the single, representative sine wave modulation in each imaged sine wave frequency pattern is determined from the sample modulation values collected from within that pattern. The sample modulation values are computed from the maximum and minimum levels corresponding to the 'peak' and adjacent 'valley' in each sine wave period. For a sine wave image, these maximum and minimum levels represent the image gray- levels that have been locally averaged in a direction perpendicular to the sinusoidal variation, and then mapped through a calibration curve into target reflectance space. Sample image modulation in target reflectance space is then defined as: modulation = (maximum - minimum) / (maximum + minimum) The calibration curve is the curve of best fit between the image gray- levels of the density patches in the sine wave target and the corresponding target reflectance values. [It is assumed that sine wave target modulations and target density patch values are supplied by the target manufacturer.] The scanner MTF at each frequency is then defined as: MTF = peak image modulation / target modulation For CTF assessment, the modulations are determined directly in image space, normalized by the image modulation at zero frequency, instead of using a calibration curve. The scanner CTF at each frequency is then defined as: CTF = peak image modulation / (zero frequency image modulation) The bar target must contain at least 10 parallel bars at each of the higher spatial frequencies (~50% Nyquist to Nyquist frequency), which helps to ensure capture of optimum scanner - target phasing and aids investigation of potential aliasing. The bar target must also contain a very low frequency component, i.e., a large square, bar, or series of bars whose effective frequency is less than 2.5 % of the scanner's final output resolution. This low frequency component is used in normalizing the CTF, it must have the same density (on the target) as the higher frequency target bars. The upper limit of 1.05 modulation is to discourage image processing that produces excessive edge sharpening, which can add false detail to an image. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 F-7 May 2, 2005

Aliasing on sine wave images or bar images may be investigated by quantitative analysis and from visual observation of the softcopy-displayed image. 2.4 Signal-to-Noise Ratio Requirement: The white signal-to- noise ratio and black signal-to-noise ratio shall each be greater than or equal to 125.0, in at least 97.0% of respective cases within each printblock measur ement area. Background : The signal is defined as the difference between the average output gray-levels obtained from scans of a uniform low reflectance and a uniform high reflectance target, measuring the average values over independent 0.25 by 0.25 inch areas within each printblock area. The noise is defined as the standard deviation of the gray- levels in each of these quarter- inch measurement areas. Therefore, for each high reflectance, low reflectance image pair there are two SNR values, one using the high reflectance standard deviation and one using the low reflectance standard deviation. In order to obtain a true measure of the standard deviation, the scanner is set up such that the white average gray-level is several gray-levels below the system's highest obtainable gray- level and the black average gray- level is several gray- levels above the system's lowest obtainable gray- level. 2.5 Gray-level Uniformity Requirement - adjacent row, column uniformity: At least 99.0% of the average gray- levels between every two adjacent quarter- inch long rows and 99.0% between every two adjacent quarter- inch long columns, within each imaged printblock area, shall not differ by more than 1.0 gray-levels when scanning a uniform low reflectance target, and shall not differ by more than 2.0 gray- levels when scanning a uniform high reflectance target. Requirement - pixel to pixel uniformity: For at least 99.9% of all pixels within every independent 0.25 by 0.25 inch area located within each imaged printblock area, no individual pixel's gray- level shall vary from the average by more than 22.0 gray- levels, when scanning a uniform high reflectance target, and shall not vary from the average by more than 8.0 gray- levels, when scanning a uniform low reflectance target.

Requirement - small area uniformity: For every two independent 0.25 by 0.25 inch areas located within each imaged printblock area, the average gray- levels of the two areas shall not differ by more than 12.0 gray- levels when scanning a uniform high reflectance target, and shall not differ by more than 3.0 gray- levels when scanning a uniform low reflectance target.

Background : Measurements are made over multiple, independent test areas, on a printblock by printblock basis. [For a live scanner, the entire capture area is normally considered a single printblock area]. In order to obtain a true measure of the standard deviation, the scanner is set up such that the white average gray- level is several gray-levels below the system's highest obtainable gray- leve l and the black average gray-level is several gray- levels above the system's lowest obtainable gray- level. 2.6 Fingerprint Image Quality The scanner shall provide high quality fingerprint images; the quality will be assessed with respect to the following requirements. Requirement - Fingerprint Gray Range: At least 80.0 % of the captured individual fingerprint images shall have a gray-scale dynamic range of at least 200 gray- levels, and at least 99.0 % shall have a dynamic range of at least 128 gray- leve ls. Background: Card and live scan systems at a booking station have some control over dynamic range, on a subject-by-subject or card-by-card basis, e.g., by rolling an inked finger properly, or by adjusting gain on a livescanner. However, with central site or file conversion systems, where a variety of card types and image qualities are encountered in rapid succession, automated adaptive processing may be necessary. The 8 bits per pixel quantization of the gray-scale values for very low contrast fingerprints needs to more optimally represent the reduced gray-scale range of such fingerprints, but without significant saturation. The intent is to avoid excessively low contrast images without adding false detail. Dynamic range is computed in terms of number of gray- levels present that have signal content, measuring within the fingerprint area and substantially excluding white background and card format lines, boxes, and text. For card scanners, compliance with these dynamic range requirements will be verified using a statistically stratified sample set of fingerprint cards assembled by the FBI. The test fingerprint card set may include cards with difficult to handle properties, e.g., tears, holes, staples, glued-on photos, or lamination, for testing card scanners which have automatic document feeder mechanisms. For live scanners, compliance will be verified with sets of livescans produced by the vendor. Requirement - Fingerprint Artifacts and Anomalies: Artifacts or anomalies detected on the fingerprint images, which are due to the scanner or image processing, shall not significantly adversely impact support to the functions of conclusive fingerprint comparisons (identification or non- identification decision), fingerprint classification, automatic feature detection, or overall Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) search reliability. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 F-9 May 2, 2005

Background: The fingerprint images will be examined to determine the presence of artifacts or anomalies that are due to the scanner or image processing; assessment may include measurements to quantify their degree of severity and significance. Image artifacts or anomalies such as the following noninclusive list may be investigated: · jitter noise effects · sharp truncations in average gray- level between adjacent printblocks · gaps in the gray- level histograms, i.e., zero pixels in intermediate gray- levels, or clipping to less than 256 possible gray- levels · imaging detector butt joints · noise streaks · card bleed-through · gray level saturation Requirement - Fingerprint Sharpness & Detail Rendition: The sharpness and detail rendition of the fingerprint images, due to the scanner or image processing, shall be high enough to support the fingerprint functions stated in section 1, paragraph 2. Background: Fingerprint sharpness and detail rendition, which is due to the scanner or image processing, may be investigated by employing suitable, objective image quality metrics, as well as by visual observation of the softcopy-displayed image.

3.0 IDENTIFICATION FLATS Traditional fingerprint sets contain both rolled and plain fingerprint images. The rolled impressions support the search processing and identification functions and the plain impressions are used primarily for sequence verification. Fingerprinting systems designed for "Identification Flats" civilian background checks capture a single set of plain impressions. This single set of plain impressions must support finger sequence verification, search processing, and identification. Image quality has historically been a challenge for civil background checks. Some programs require a large number of relatively low volume capture sites, which makes training difficult. A key goal for identification flats scanners is to reduce the need for training, so that inexperienced users consistently capture quality fingerprint images. The Identification Flats scanner shall meet all of the requirements stated in Section 2 of this Appendix F as well as the following requirements. Requirement ­ Capture Protocol: The system shall provide a simple capture protocol. Background: A simple capture protocol supports the inexperienced user's ability to more consistently capture high quality fingerprints. Identification Flats collection systems will be evaluated for their ability to produce a very small rate of failure to enroll in an operational setting. Systems with a minimum capture area of 3.2 inches (width) by 2.9 inches (height), which can capture 4 fingers simultaneously in an upright position, will be considered in compliance with the simple capture protocol requirement. Other capture approaches will require specific testing and documentation. Requirement ­ Verifiable Finger Sequence Data: The method of capturing the fingers shall result in very low probability of error in the finger numbers. Background: The fingerprinting system's capture protocol will be evaluated for its ability to capture verifiable finger sequence data. Systems with a minimum capture area of 3.2 inches (width) by 2.9 inches (height), which capture 4 fingers simultaneously in an upright position, will be considered in compliance with the finger sequence requirements. Other capture approaches will require specific testing and documentation.

4.0 FINGERPRINT PRINTER The fingerprint printer, consisting of a printer and specialized print algorithm, must be capable of producing hardcopy images which exhibit good geometric fidelity, sharpness, detail rendition, gray- level uniformity, and gray-scale dynamic range characteristics, with low noise, no significant creation of false detail, and with the capability to support magnified viewing of the print without breakup of the virtual fingerprint image presented to the eye. This printer is expected to provide high throughput, good repeatability, good print permanency characteristics, and low cost per copy. A typical fingerprint printer is a gray-scale laser printer 5 with 1200 black/white dots per inch resolution, combined with a printing algorithm that typically includes image contrast and printer gamma/highlight/lowlight adjustments, image rescaling, and an error diffusion model with randomized dot dither printing applied to the rescaled image. The print system's principle function is to produce life-size prints of digital fingerprints that have met IAFIS format requirements, as specified in [EFTS] and [ANSI/NIST], and to provide sufficient print quality to support fingerprint comparisons, i.e., support identification or nonidentification decisions. The printer should also have the capability to print gray-scale mugshots and property/evidence photos (not necessarily using a fingerprint printing algorithm), as well as print black & white documents containing text and graphics, onto 8.5 x 11.0 inch paper. A required printer resolution is 500 ppi, which produces the required life-size print when the input digital fingerprint is 500 ppi, or when a 1000 ppi digital fingerprint is down-scaled to 500 ppi prior to printing. In both cases all other 500 ppi printer requirements must also be met. Verification of the specific performance requirements in this section 4 of Appendix F is accomplished by evaluating the printer's output print of an FBI-designated test set of digitized fingerprints and FBI-designated digital test target. Requirements compliance verification is performed by a combination of visual assessments of the test prints (aided by visual instruments) and computer-aided assessments of scanned digital images of the test prints. With respect to those requirements that depend on assessments of print scans for compliance verification, the scan resolution is expected to be twice the required gray-scale print resolution, e.g., a print with 500 ppi resolution is scanned at 1000 ppi, and the scanner is expected to be setup in a calibrated linear input/output, grayscale reflectance capture mode. 4.1 Spatial Frequency Response Requirement: The printer shall provide sufficient spatial frequency response to support visually resolving the required printer resolution, in orthogonal directions on the print.

In this Appendix, "laser printer" refers to a type of printer in which a laser beam `draws' an electrostatic image of an input signal onto a drum. Toner (typically dry powder) is then transferred to the charged areas of the drum, which then transfers the toner onto paper, where it is fused by heat, creating a black/white/gray image. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 F-12 May 2, 2005

Background: Resolution verification is performed by printing high contrast digital bar targets and visually inspecting the print under magnification. [When employing a laser printer with a fingerprint printing algorithm, it is recognized and accepted that the effective resolution may vary in complex image areas such as a fingerprint.] The resolution limit is a single point on the spatial frequency response curve; the entire curve may be measured by scanning the print of an appropriate target, performing appropriate computer-aided assessment on the scan, and comparing results to a minimally acceptable spatial frequency response curve. 4.2 Gray-levels Requirement: At least 16 gray- levels shall be visually distinguishable on the print. Background: Visual observation of the print of a digital target containing a step tablet is used to verify the 16 gray- level requirement. A higher number of gray- levels is expected to be distinguishable by appropriate computer-aided assessment of the scanned image of the print. 4.3 Dynamic Range Requirement: The printer shall have the capability to print an input digital image gray range of at least 150, excluding print black saturation and print white saturation. Background: The print of a digital step tablet is scanned, each pixel's output gray- level value is converted to the corresponding print reflectance value, and the average print reflectance value within each step is computed. A plot of step average print reflectance versus input digital step tablet gray level must result in a gray range of at least 150, excluding anysaturation on the low end (print black reflectance) and high end (print white reflectance). [The scanner output gray- level to print reflectance conversion is established by gene rating the scanner's input/output curve using a calibrated step tablet.] 4.4 Geometric Accuracy and Print Scale Requirement (across-bar): When printing a digital bar target containing multiple, parallel bars, then the absolute value of the difference between the measured distance across parallel bars on the print and the correct distance on the print, shall not exceed the following values, for at least 97% of the tested cases in each direction (vertical and horizontal): D = 0.001, D = 0.015X, IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 for 0.00 < X = 0.07 for 0.07 < X = 1.50 F-13 May 2, 2005

where: D = |Y-X| X = correct distance = digital target pixels / required print resolution Y = measured distance on print D, X, Y are in inches Requirement (along-line): Straight target lines printed parallel to, or at a 45 degree angle to, the paper or card edges, shall be straight on the print, with no significant waviness, bow, or `staircasing'. Background: The across-bar requirement corresponds to a positional accuracy of ± 1.5% for distances greater than 0.07 inches and less than or equal to 1.5 inches, and a constant ± 0.001 inches for distances less than or equal to 0.07 inches. With a 500 ppi required print resolution, a digital bar target with a period of 18 pixels is used, which corresponds to a bar frequency of 500 / (25.4*18) cy/mm on the print, when printed life-size. The measured distance on the print can be obtained by scanning the print and applying computer-assisted assessment on the resulting digital image. The requirement takes into account the geometric errors inherent in a good quality scanner. For life-size printing, the print scale error is measured over a distance in the 0.07 to 1.50 inch range. Print scale error is equal to: (correct distance - measured distance) / correct distance. For life-size printing at 500 ppi, a 1.5% allowable error in distance, measured in inches, is equivalent to an allowable print ppi error equal to ± 7.5 ppi. The along- line requirement can be assessed visually, aided, e.g., by a straight-edge and magnifying lens. 4.5 Noise Requirement: For a required printer resolution of 500 ppi, the noise magnitude shall be less than 0.120 at each average print reflectance level, when noise magnitude is defined as the standard deviation of print reflectance values within an area on the print corresponding to a constant gray level on the input digital target. [Print reflectance measured in fractional units: 0.0 to 1.0 range.] Background: A digital step tablet is printed, the print is scanned at 1000 ppi, each pixel's output gray- level value is converted to the corresponding print reflectance value, and the standard deviation of print reflectance values within each step is computed. The scanner output gray- level to print reflectance conversion is established by generating the scanner's input/output curve using a calibrated step tablet. 4.6 Print Polarity and Color Requirement:

IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1

F-14

May 2, 2005

The printed fingerprints shall appear as dark gray-to-black ridges on a light gray-to-white background. 4.7 Print Permanence Requirement: The printed fingerprints shall not smear or smudge with normal handling. 4.8 Print Stability Requirement: Both the fingerprints and the card stock or paper on which they are printed shall retain their visually neutral (black, white, gray) color over time. 4.9 Hazardous Materials Requirement: The prints shall not produce any health hazard as a result of handling. They shall not produce any noxious, annoying, or unpleasant odors when accumulated in large numbers and handled in areas having limited ventilation. Background: Requirements 4.7 (print permanence), 4.8 (print stability), and 4.9 (hazardous materials) are met by standard laser printers. 4.10 FINGERPRINT PRINTS 4.10.1 Print Types Requirements The printer shall have the capability to print a set of individual livescans or previously scanned, individual inked fingerprints, life-size and in their correct printblock locations, onto a standard ten-print fingerprint card (e.g., fingerprint card type FD-258), or print onto blank 8.0 by 8.0 inch card stock, or print onto blank 8.5 x 11.0 inch plain paper. In the case of printing fingerprints onto blank card stock or blank paper, the printer shall also print the printblock boundary lines and labeling that normally appears on a standard ten-print card. The printer shall have the capability to print a previously scanned ten-print card, in its entirety and life-size, onto blank 8.0 x 8.0 inch card stock, or onto blank 8.5 by 11.0 inch plain paper. The printer shall have the capability to print a single fingerprint, magnified up to 5 times beyond life-size, onto 8.5 by 11.0 inch plain paper. When printing in ten-print card format onto ten-print card stock, blank card stock, or plain paper, the printer shall also have the capability to print labels, bar chart, step tablet, and finger condition codes, all on the same print with the fingerprints. Figure 4-1 illustrates the printing of this auxiliary information; following sections 4.10.2 through 4.10.5 give the detailed requirements. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 F-15 May 2, 2005

4.10.2 Labels Requirement: When printing fingerprints in ten-print card format, the printing process shall have the capability to print a character string of scanner information within the left four finger plain impression printblock, and a character string of printer information within the right four finger plain impression printblock. Each character string shall be printed along the top inside edge of the respective printblock, in a type font and size that is large enough for human readability without the aid of a magnifier, and small enough so as not to unduly impinge on fingerprint structure. The scanner information string shall include the scanner make, model number, and serial number, if available, and/or similar information on the scanner system. The printer information string shall include the printer make, model number, and serial number, if available, shall include similar information on the fingerprint printing algorithm, if available, and shall include the date and time of printing. The scanner and printer character strings shall be printed without a background, border, or any other type of added surround. Background: Information for the scanner string can typically be obtained from the EFTS Type-2 Record Field identified as "IMA 2.067 - Image Capture Equipment", which includes scanner system make, model number, and serial number. A printer is certified as a combination of a specific brand/model printer and fingerprint printing algorithm; the latter may also have a name or version designation. Character string printing: a solid background (e.g., white) to the character string is unacceptable because it would unnecessarily obliterate some parts of fingerprints on some images. Individual characters with no background that overprint the fingerprint, would obliterate a much smaller proportion of the fingerprint and are acceptable. Printing the character strings in an open space created by off-setting printblocks 6-10 from printblocks 11-14 is unacceptable because it changes the dimensions of the standard ten-print card format, and it cannot adequately accommodate fingerprints that stray across printblock boundaries. Proper text size typically would correspond to a height of a numeral or upper case letter being in the range : 0.067 inches to 0.095 inches. 4.10.3 Bar Chart Requirement: When printing fingerprints in ten-print card format, the printing process shall have the capability to print a bar chart, consisting of equally-spaced horizontal black bars and vertical black bars printed at the required printer resolution.

IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1

F-16

May 2, 2005

The Bar Chart shall be positioned at the top edge within the right thumb plain impression printblock and shall have a maximum width of 0.8 inches and a maximum height of 0.125 inches. The Bar Chart shall contain at least 10 parallel bars in each direction, vertical and horizontal, with a bar length of at least 0.0625 inches (not necessarily the same number of bars, or same bar length, in the two directions). An optional, uniform mid-grey level patch may be included between the horizontal and vertical bar components. The bar chart shall be printed without a background, border, or any other type of added surround. Background: For a 500 ppi printer requirement the limiting frequency is 250 cycles per inch, which implies that 250 black bars per inch are printed, where the 0.002 inch width of an individual bar is equal to the width of the white space between two bars. If a mid-gray patch between the vertical and horizontal bar patterns appears to have the same overall gray- level on the print as the two bar patterns, then this may indicate that the printer gamma/highlight/lowlight settings are optimum and/or that the printer toner supply was adequate for printing. 4.10.4 Step Tablet Requirement: When printing fingerprints in ten-print card format, the printing process shall have the capability to print a step tablet, consisting of two adjacent horizontal bands, each band having 16 graylevels. The top band shall progressively darken from left to right and the bottom band shall progressively darken from right to left. The 16 digital input gray- levels corresponding to one band shall be identically the same as for the other band, and both bands shall substantially cover the total gray- level range. This step tablet shall be positioned at the top edge within the left thumb plain impression printblock and shall have a total width between 0.5 inches and 0.8 inches, and a total height between 0.0625 inches and 0.125 inches. The step tablet shall be printed without a background, border, or any other type of surround. Background: If the top band and bottom band appear `balanced' on the print, i.e., the same mid- gray- level appears in the middle of both the top and bottom bands, then this may indicate that the printer gamma/highlight/lowlight settings are optimum. 4.10.5 Finger Condition Codes Requirement: When printing fingerprints in ten-print card format, the printing process shall have the capability to notate the presence of an abnormal finger condition in the appropriate printed fingerprint block, for those cases where the EFTS Type-2 Record Field identified as "AMP" (amputated or IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 F-17 May 2, 2005

bandaged) is available, and/or for those cases where similar information is available from other sources, such as a state system (possibly with other notation codes). 4.10.6 Fingerprint Quality Requirement: The printer shall produce sufficient print quality to allow usable viewing of life-size fingerprint prints under magnification, in order to support fingerprint comparisons, i.e., support identification or non-identification decisions. The print image shall maintain its sharpness and detail rendition structure up to at least 4X magnification, to the extent that ridges, and ridge joints, bifurcations, and terminations that exist in the input digital image to the printer, can be substantially discerned by the human observer on the output print, without being 'lost in the noise.' In addition, the printing process shall not create significant false detail, e.g., shall not create ridges where none existed in the input digital image. Background: Assessment of the requirement is performed by visual inspection of the print augmented by appropriate quantitative analysis of the scanned print.

5. FAST-TRACK CERTIFICATION First, to review, full certification testing is required when: · An uncertified livescan device is presented together with suitable SW, such that the combination prospectively meets all IQS requirements. · A hardcopy scanner or printer (typically a COTS product) is presented together with suitable SW, such that the combination prospectively meets all IQS requirements. [The specific SW may be sold separately from the COTS HW but only the specific HW/SW combination is certified.] · Substantive modifications are made to an already-certified device. For example, the sensor or optics is changed, the capture area is expanded, the signal processing is substantively changed, or a 500 ppi certified device is extended for operation at 1000 ppi.

Fast Track certification testing is sufficient when: · A vendor adds `value' to an already-certified device, for example, by integrating additional SW and/or HW, and repackaging the combination to create a VAR label system. However, if there is a reasonable expectation that the added SW, HW, or repackaging will affect the image quality performance of the original certified device, then full certification testing would be required. · A vendor makes relatively minor modifications to a previously certified device. For example, a membrane is added to (or deleted from) a certified livescanner, an automatic document feeder is added to a certified manual- feed cardscanner, or a 1000 ppi certified scanner is operated at 500 ppi, using the same optics, sensor, and illumination. Table 5-1 presents the test data requirements for some common Fast Track certification scenarios; for test requirements for other scenarios contact the FBI. In addition to the test data, the vendor seeking Fast Track certification must provide a written statement to the FBI (letter or email) which affirms that the previously certified fingerprint device has not been changed, with respect to device functions, hardware, firmware, or software that could reasonably be expected to affect image quality performance*. Specific to a scanner, the optics and optical layout, sensor, illumination, image capture electronics and signal processing have not been changed and the maximum capture area has not been increased. * Except for inherent image quality changes in specific situations, e.g., when recertifying a 1000 ppi
scanner at 500 ppi.

No certification testing is necessary when: · The original recipient of a certification wishes to change the model name and there are no other changes to the certified product. · The original recipient of a certification wishes to repackage the device, if there is a reasonable expectation that the repackaging will not affect the image quality performance of the device. All device HW/SW components that may affect image quality performance must remain the same as they were when originally certified. For example, repackaging a device into a ruggedized cabinet, or repackaging a floor-standing device as a desktop device by separating-out the host computer would not necessarily require further testing, but changing the optical path or optical train of elements to accommodate the repackaging would normally require retesting. · A reseller of a certified device wishes to sell the device under it's own label, or under the original label. The certified device must remain intact, unmodified, and as a stand-alone product with no added HW/SW. If relabeled by reseller, the certification is only valid when that label does in fact contain the originally certified device, i.e., no blanket certification for rebrands. · An end user receives a certified device to be used `as is', without modification (an end- user does not need its own certification).

APPENDIX G INTERIM IAFIS IMAGE QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS FOR SCANNERS 1.0 SCOPE AND PURPOSE SCANNERS These specifications were originally for the purpose of accrediting 500 ppi live scanners and card scanners integrated into automated booking stations. These Appendix G interim image quality specifications for scanners were decommissioned for IAFIS certifications in July 1999; all fingerprint systems submitted for IAFIS certification after July 1999 must meet the Appendix F requirements. 2.1 Gray-Scale Linearity No change from Appendix F of Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification, dated January 29, 1999, FBI document number CJIS-RS-0010 (V7). 2.2 Geometric Image Accuracy The absolute value of the difference "D," between the actual distance "X" between any two points on a target and the distance "Y" between those same two points as measured on the output scanned image of that target, shall meet the following requirements for the value D: D = 0.001, D = 0.015X, for 0 = X = 0.07 for 0.07 = X = 1.50

where: D, X, Y are in inches and D = absolute value of (Y-X) The requirement corresponds to a positional accuracy of ± 1.5% for distances between 0.07 and 1.5 inches, and a cons tant ± 0.001 inches (1/2 pixel) for distances less than or equal to 0.07 inches. 2.3 Modulation Transfer Function cy/mm sine wave MTF 1 0.889 to 1.40 2 0.778 to 1.40 3 0.667 to 1.40 4 0.556 to 1.40 5 0.444 to 1.40 6 0.333 to 1.00 8 0.111 to 1.00 10 0.000 to 1.00 The MTF shall be measured using a sine wave test target unless scanner characteristics are incompatible with imaging a continuous tone sine wave target, in which case a bar target may be used.

2.4 Signal-to-Noise Ratio No change from Appendix F of Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification, dated January 29, 1999, FBI document number CJIS-RS-0010 (V7). 2.5 Gray-level Uniformity No change from Appendix F of Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification, dated January 29, 1999, FBI document number CJIS-RS-0010 (V7). 2.6 Gray-Scale Range of Image Data At least 80% of the captured individual fingerprint images shall have a gray-scale dynamic range of at least 150 gray-levels. For this requirement, "dynamic range" is defined as the total number of gray- levels that have signal content from the fingerprint image. Fingerprint card format lines, boxes, and text shall be excluded from the dynamic range computation, and white surround in the immediate vicinity of a given fingerprint shall be included in the dynamic range computation.

APPENDIX H DESCRIPTORS AND FIELD EDIT SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPE-7 LOGICAL RECORDS FGP - FINGER POSITION. This mandatory fixed-length field shall occupy the 7th through 12th bytes of a Type-7 record. It shall contain possible finger positions beginning the least- most byte of the field (byte seven of the record). The decimal code number for the known or most probable finger position shall be taken from Table 6 "Finger Position code & maximum size" of the standard "Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial & Scar Mark & Tatoo (SMT) Information", ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000. The number shall be entered as a binary number, right justified and left zero filled within the eight-bit byte. Up to five additional finger positions may be referenced by entering the alternate finger positions in the remaining five bytes using the same format. If fewer than five finger position references are to be used, the unused bytes shall be filled with the binary equivalent of "255". The code "0" (for "Unknown finger") shall be used to reference every finger position from one through ten. CGA - GRAYSCALE COMPRESSION ALGORITHM. This mandatory one-byte field shall occupy the 18th byte of a Type-7 record. It shall be used to specify the type of grayscale compression algorithm used (if any). A binary "0" denotes no compression.

APPENDIX J DESCRIPTORS AND FIELD EDIT SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPE-9 LOGICAL RECORDS

AFV 9.013 - AFIS FEATURE VECTOR. This field is a bit packed field on the minutiae, the nearest neighbors, pattern class, and ridge counts. Its presence in the Type-9 record is allowed by including a `U' in the tagged field 9.004. It possesses sufficient features data to replace the rest of the Type-9 native mode record. APC 9.017 - AFIS/FBI PATTERN CLASSIFICATION. The field contains one to three subfields separated by the <RS> separator with each subfield composed of three information items separated by the <US> separator character. Each subfield reports a possible basic pattern class (APAT) and the ridge counts (RCN1, RCN2) defining its subpattern class. The AFIS/FBI automatic classifier recognizes only four basic pattern classes: arch (AU), left slant loop (LS), right slant loop (RS), and whorl (WU). It further subdivides the basic pattern classes of loops and whorls according to the count of ridges crossed or touched along a straight line joining the core(s) to the delta(s). The count is one more than the number of intervening ridges. For latents, the latent examiner is expected to make a best estimate as opposed to a range. AFIS/FBI treats all indicated pattern classes equally (i.e., no significance given to the order of the possible classes provided). AFIS/FBI will apply a suitable tolerance to the specified ridge count for search space penetration. The tagged field accommodates a primary pattern and up to two reference patterns in the one-to-three subfields. The first information item of a subfield contains the two-character symbol for the pattern being designated. The second and third information items contain the appropriate subpattern class ridge count between the core(s) and the delta(s). A zero (0) should be entered if a ridge count is not appropriate; a thirty-one (31) if it was appropriate but not counted or indeterminate. Both information fields are zero for an arch, the second information item in a subfield should be zero if the pattern for the subfield is a loop, while neither information item should be zero for a whorl. If a whorl is indicated in pattern classification, the second information item (RCN1) of a subfield contains the ridge count from the left delta to the downward opening core, and the third information item (RCN2) contains the ridge count from the right delta to the upward opening core. This implies that a central pocket whorl will have both a downward and an upward opening (directed) core generally aligned along the major axis of the innermost ellipse. If the automatic or manual classifier indicates all four basic patterns are possible, then the fingerprint should be designated as "fully referenced" by providing only one subfield with the first information item "UC"; the second and third information items should both be set to "31". If a particular fingerprint was not characterized for a ten-print native mode search request, no Type-9 logical record should be submitted for that finger position and the classification code for the missing finger must be placed in the Type-2 pattern class field.

CHQ 9.024 - CHARACTERIZATION QUALITY. This is a single information item field. Within AFIS/FBI the principal quality parameter is the "Equivalent Number of Minutiae". The distribution of the parameter over thousands of fingerprints approximates a Gaussian with mean of about 50 and standard deviation of about 12. The equivalent number of minutiae is calculated as the sum of the weighted normalized quality with the weighting being the number of qualified neighbors for the minutia divided by the maximum number of neighbors (eight). The normalized minutia quality ranges from unity (best) to zero (worst). A qualified neighbor would be another minutia with a reliable separating ridge count (less than 14) and within a reliable distance (not more than 1/5 inch). CLQ 9.025 - CLASSIFIER QUALITY. This is a single information item field of seven characters representing a positive real number between one (1.0000) and 99 (99.9999) indicating the quality or confidence of the automatic classification. The presence of the information item may reduce the AFIS/FBI processing load, but its absence will not degrade AFIS/FBI performance. A value of 1.0000 indicates best possible quality or confidence; increasing values indicate progressively worse quality or confidence. The information item format shall be XX.YYYY in which XX represents the integer portion and YYYY the fractional portion to four decimal places with a decimal point (period) between. COF 9.019- COORDINATE OFFSETS. This field allows the recording of translation, rotation, and image cropping employed in the characterization process to allow the examiner or an analyst to overlay onto the original or intermediate image the features reported in this record. The field contains five, eight-character information items each separated by the <US> separator. For AFIS/FBI the units are in original image pixels and degrees using standard image processing coordinates; that is, (0,0) origin at the upper left, column index increasing from left to right, and row index increasing from top to bottom. The column and row coordinate indexes (XYP) shall be coded as a single eight-digit integer number comprised of a four-digit column coordinate (X) concatenated with a four-digit row coordinate (Y) using a format of XXXXYYYY. A minus sign is permitted in the leftmost digit of a four-digit group. The first information item contains IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 J-2 May 2, 2005

the offset to the upper left corner of a non-rotated subimage used subsequently in image processing. The second information item contains the coordinates of the center of rotation within the subimage about which the subimage is rotated. The third information item contains the clockwise rotation angle (THET) in ten-thousandths of a degree resolution (e.g., 072.2342) including the decimal point. The fourth information item contains the coordinates of the center of rotation in the rotated subimage after the sub image has been translated to eliminate negative column and row indexes. The fifth information item contains the upper- left-corner column and row offsets to a cropped subimage taken from the rotated image once adjusted to eliminate negative coordinate values. Unused information items may be empty, but the <US> separators must be included. CRA 9.021 - CORE(S) ATTRIBUTE. This field is for cores that can be perceived in the fingerprint (both ten-print and latent). If there is no core perceived in the fingerprint image, the tagged field should be omitted. This field contains up to two subfields (one subfield for each core) separated by the <RS> separator. Each subfield contains three information items separated by the <US> separator representing the attributes of each core. The first information item of a subfield contains the X and Y coordinate position of the core (XYM). The position shall be established either automatically or manually according to the definitions presented in The Science of Fingerprints. The X and Y values shall be coded as a single eight-digit integer number comprised of the four-digit X coordinate (column) followed by the four-digit Y coordinate (row) using a format of XXXXYYYY. The X coordinate and Y coordinate are in units of 10 micrometers with the origin at the upper left. Core positions shall be in the same coordinate system as the minutiae. The second information item of a subfield is of three-digit size and contains the direction of the core in integer degrees (DID). The direction is that of the core opening, through the center of curvature for the innermost recurve at maximum curvature. The direction angle is positive counterclockwise from the reference horizontal to the right. Direction angles shall be reported between "001" and "360" degrees only. The value "000" shall be reserved for "direction not provided" while "360" shall be equivalent to zero degrees. The third information item of a subfield is of four-digit size representing the radius of position uncertainty (PUM) in the manual or automatic placement of the core in integer units of 10 micrometers. CRP 9.008 - CORE POSITION. This eight-character field shall contain the X and Y coordinate position of the core. The X and Y values shall be coded as a single eight-digit integer number comprised of the four digit X-coordinate followed by the four digit Y-coordinate using a format of XXXXYYYY. DLA 9.022 - DELTA(S) ATTRIBUTES. This field is for deltas that can be perceived in the fingerprint for both AFIS/FBI latent and ten-print characterizations. If there is no delta perceived in the fingerprint image, the tagged field should be omitted. This field contains up to two subfields (one subfield for each delta) separated by the <RS> separator. Each subfield contains five (5) information items separated by the <US> separator representing the attributes of each delta.

IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1

The first information item of a subfield consists of eight characters and contains the X and Y coordinate position (XYM) of the delta(s). The position shall be established either automatically or manually according to the definitions presented in The Science of Fingerprints. The X and Y values shall be coded as a single eight-digit integer number comprised of the four-digit X coordinate (column) followed by the four-digit Y coordinate (row) using a format of XXXXYYYY. The X coordinate and Y coordinate are in units of 10 micrometers with the origin at the upper left. Delta positions shall be in the same coordinate system as the minutiae. The next three information items of a subfield shall be of three-digit size each to contain the three directions of ridge flow (DID) outward from the delta in integer degrees. The second information item of a subfield is the direction of the ridge flow upward from the delta. The third information item of a subfield shall be the direction of ridge flow outward from the delta and to the left. The fourth information item shall be the direction of the ridge flow outward from the delta to the right. The direction angles are positive counterclockwise from the reference horizontal to the right. Direction angles shall be reported between "001" and "360" degrees only. The value "000" shall be reserved for "direction not provided" while "360" shall be equivalent to zero degrees. The fifth subfield of four-digit size represents the radius of position uncertainty (PUM) in the manual or automatic placement of the delta in integer units of 10 micrometers. DLT 9.009 - DELTA(S) POSITION. This eight-character field shall contain the X and Y positional coordinates of each delta that is present on the fingerprint. The X and Y values shall be recorded in the same manner as was the core position, CRP. Multiple occurrences of delta positions shall be separated by the RS separator. FCP 9.016 - FINGERPRINT CHARACTERIZATION PROCESS. This field of three information items identifies the characterization equipment and the amount of manual intervention employed in the characterization process. The three information items shall be separated by the <US> separator. The first information item shall contain the name of the organization (VEN) providing the automatic process software. The second information item shall be a vendor-supplied, alphanumeric character pair (VID) representing the model and/or version of the automatic process. The third information item (MET) shall be an ordered sequence of three characters selected from the following list indicating the degree of automation in the characterization process.

MAT 9.023 MINUTIAE AND RIDGE COUNT DATA. This AFIS/FBI field shall contain all of the individual minutiae and ridge count data associated with the current fingerprint impression. It shall be comprised of as many subfields as there are minutiae stated in the minutiae count in the tagged field 9.015, NMN. Each subfield shall be devoted to a single minutia and shall consist of multiple information items. Subfields shall be separated by the <RS> separator character. All information items within a subfield shall be separated by the <US> separator character. The minutiae shall be indexed from one to NMN and need not be ordered according to any particular attribute. The first two information items are required and the others allow AFIS/FBI to achieve best possible candidate list performance. An information item may be omitted but its separator character must remain, except all ridge count data must be present with special values designating missing or omitted data. Index number (MDX): The first information item shall be the index number, which shall be initialized to one and incremented by one for each additional minutia in the fingerprint. This index number serves to identify each individual minutia. X, Y, and theta values (XYT): The X and Y coordinates are values ranging from zero upward and the theta direction value, between 000 and 360, shall comprise the second required information item. These three values shall be coded and recorded as a single 11-digit integer number corresponding to the concatenated X, Y, and theta values, in that order. If the minutia is of Type D, the theta value shall be recorded as "000". The origin of the coordinate system shall be the upper left corner of the image with X increasing to the right and Y increasing downward. The coordinate system units shall be units of 0.01mm (10 micrometers). The direction of an ending shall be into the ending ridge and the direction of a bifurcation shall be into the white space created by the dividing ridge. Angles shall be in integer degrees measured positive counterclockwise from a reference horizontal and to the right. The XY coordinates shall be applied after all rotation and translation of the image has been accomplished. Quality measure (QMS): If present, the third information item is the minutia quality measure. The two-digit values shall range from zero to 63. The value zero shall indicate a manually encoded minutia. The value one shall indicate that no method of indicating a confidence level is available. Values between two and 63 shall indicate decreasing levels of confidence, with two denoting the greatest confidence. Minutia type designation (MNT): The fourth information item is the minutia type designation. This shall be a single character chosen as follows:

Description Ridge ending Ridge bifurcation Ridge ending or bifurcation, no distinction provided Type other tha n ending or bifurcation

Type A B C D

Ridge count data (MRO): The fifth information item is the ridge count data for the nearest neighboring minutiae of the indexed minutia. It shall be formatted as a series of eight subitems, each consisting of a minutia index number and a ridge count. This information shall be conveyed by combining the identity (MDX) of the neighboring minutia and the ridge count to that neighboring minutia into a five digit number. For AFIS/FBI, the minutia identification index (MDX) shall inc rease from 1 to 254. The ridge count values (one more than number of intervening ridges) shall range from 0 to 15; with 14 indicating a count greater than 13, and 15 indicating an indeterminate count. Up to eight neighboring minutiae can be recorded, each being the nearest neighbor in an angular sector of 45 degrees (octant) with the zero-th octant centered (+/- 22.5 degrees) and aligned with the direction of the minutia and increasing in octant index in the counterclockwise direction. If a minutia does not have a neighbor in a particular octant, the value "25515" should be used for the subitem. Octant residuals (RSO): The last information item of eight ASCII characters indicates into which half of the octant each neighboring minutia lies. This subfield is beneficial for performance but not mandatory. The characters are ordered left to right according to the ascending octant index. The corresponding character shall be one if the neighboring minutia lies in the counterclockwise half of the octant. The corresponding character shall be zero if the neighboring minutia lies in the clockwise half of the octant or if there is no neighboring minutia in the octant. MIN 9.010 - NUMBER OF MINUTIAE. This single character field shall contain the count of the number of minutiae recorded for this fingerprint. MRC 9.012 - MINUTIAE AND RIDGE COUNT DATA. This field shall contain all of the individual minutiae and ridge count data associated with the current fingerprint impression. It shall be comprised of as many subfields as there are minutiae stated in the minutiae count in field, MIN. Each subfield shall be devoted to a single minutia and shall consist of multiple information items. All information items shall be separated by the US separator character. NMN 9.015 NUMBER OF MINUTIAE. This AFIS/FBI field shall contain the count of the number of minutiae recorded for this fingerprint. For AFIS/FBI the number should not exceed 254. If the number of minutiae provided in this field exceeds the number of minutiae the system can accommodate, the list will be truncated according to the reported minutia quality. Minutiae below the proximal crease generally are not included.

OFR 9.005 - ORIGINATING FINGERPRINT READING SYSTEM. The originator's designation or name for the particular fingerprint reading system that generated the record shall be placed in the first information item of this field. The second information item of this field shall be a single character to indicate the method by which the minutiae data was read, encoded, and recorded. Allowable codes are listed in the table below. The third information item is an optional, two-character, user-generated subsystem designator that uniquely identifies the originator's equipment. Description Data automatically read, encoded, and recorded, no human editing. Human editing was possible but unneeded. Data was automatically read but manually edited before encoding and recording. Data was manually read. Code A

ORN 9.020- ORIENTATION UNCERTAINTY. The orientation uncertainty is a substantial contribution for AFIS/FBI latent characterizations and is not used for ten-print searches. This one-to-three character field contains an estimate of the deviation in degrees of the latent image (after rotation and translation to support editing and characterization) relative to fingertip up. The entry shall be the absolute value of the angular deviation from "tip-up". The uncertainty would be zero if the impression were made with the extended finger aligned with the vertical of the displayed image. It is expected to be a human visual estimate of "the final image is aligned tip up within about X-degrees". If the examiner does not provide an estimate, the default value shall be 180. RDG 9.011 - MINUTIAE RIDGE COUNT INDICATOR. This single character field shall be used to indicate the presence of minutiae ridge count information. A "0" (zero) in this field indicates that no ridge count information is available. A "1" (one) indicates that ridge count information is available. ROV 9.018- REGION OF VALUE. This is a field of 3 to 20 subfields separated by the <RS> separator defining the vertices of a polygon that bounds the region of the image from which the characterization products have been extracted. Each eight-character subfield consists of the concatenation of the row and column coordinates (XYM) with the first four digits representing the column and the second four digits representing the row in the XXXXYYYY structure. The vertices shall be identified in the same coordinate system as the minutiae, cores, and deltas in units of 10 micrometers and padded on the left with zeros as appropriate. The order of the vertices must be in their consecutive order around the perimeter of the polygon, either clockwise or counterclockwise. The polygon side defined by the last subfield and the first subfield shall complete the polygon. The polygon must be a simple, plane figure with no sides crossing and no interior holes.

APPENDIX K DESCRIPTORS AND FIELD EDIT SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPE-10 LOGICAL RECORDS AND LOGICAL RECORD FIELD LISTS FOR TYPE-2 (PHOTO) RECORDS APPENDIX AND F CSP 10.012 - COLORSPACE. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the color space used to exchange the image. For compressed images, the preferred colorspace using baseline JPEG and JFIF is YcbCr2 to be coded as "YCC". An entry of "GRAY" shall be used for all gray scale images. For uncompressed color images containing non- interleaved red, green, and blue pixels in that order, this field shall contain "RGB". All other colorspaces are undefined. DAT 10.999 - IMAGE DATA. This field shall contain all of the gray scale or color data from a face image. It shall begin with the ASCII identifier "10.999", and be followed by image data in a binary representation. Each pixel of uncompressed gray scale data shall be quantized to eight bits (256 gray levels) contained in a single byte. Uncompressed color image data shall be expressed as 24-bit RGB pixels. The first byte shall contain the eight bits for the red component of the pixel, the second byte shall contain the eight bits for the green component of the pixel, and the third byte shall contain the last eight bits for the blue component of the pixel. If compression is used, the pixel data shall be compressed in accordance with the compression technique specified in the CGA field. If the JPEG algorithm is to be used to compress the data, this field shall be encoded using the JFIF format specification. CGA 10.011 - COMPRESSION ALGORITHM. This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the algorithm used to compress the color or gray scale image. An entry of "NONE" in the field indicates that the data contained in this record is uncompressed. For those images that are to be compressed, the required method for the compression of facial images to the FBI is specified by the baseline mode of the JPEG algorithm formatted in accordance with the JPEG File Interchange Format, Version 1.02 (JFIF).1 An entry of "JPEGB" indicates that the scanned or captured image was compressed using baseline JPEG. An entry of "JPEGL" indicates that the lossless mode of the JPEG algorithm was used to compress the image. If the image is captured in gray scale, then only the luminescence component will be compressed and transmitted. When transmitting images to the FBI, the image(s) comprising the image set, that accompany the Ten-Print Criminal Submission, should average no larger than 40KB in size. __________________ 1 Developed by C-Cube Microsystems, 1778 McCarthy Blvd., Milpitas, CA 95035

The FBI will maintain a registry of additional compression techniques and corresponding codes that may be used as they become available in the future. HLL 10.006 - HORIZONTAL LINE LENGTH. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of pixels contained on a single horizontal line of the transmitted image. HPS 10.009 - HORIZONTAL PIXEL SCALE. This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the pixel density used in the horizontal direction providing the SLC contains a "1" or a "2". Otherwise, it indicates the horizontal component of the pixel aspect ratio. IDC 10.002 - IMAGE DESIGNATION CHARACTER. The Image Designation Character shall be a sequentially assigned positive integer starting from zero and increasing by one for each finger position, image, or Type-10 record present. Each IDC value matches a value in the Content (CNT) field of the Type-1 message header. IMT 10.003 - IMAGE TYPE. This mandatory ASCII field is used to indicated the type of image contained in this record. It shall contain "FACE", to indicate a face image. The content of this field shall conform to the requirements set forth by the agency to whom the transmission is being sent. LEN 10.001 - LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the total count of the number of bytes in this Type-10 logical record. Field 10.001 shall begin with "10.001:", followed by the length of the record including every character of every field contained in the record and the information separators. The number of characters added to the record by the LEN field itself shall be included in calculating the value of LEN. PHD 10.005 - PHOTO DATE. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the date that the facial image contained in the record was captured. The date shall appear as an eight-digit number in the format CCYYMMDD. The CCYY characters shall represent the year the image was captured; the MM characters shall be the tens and units values of the month; and the DD characters shall be the tens and units values of the day in the month. For example, 19960229 represents February 29, 1996. The photo date shall not exceed the current date, except when the submission originates from an international contributor located in a time zone earlier than the Eastern Time Zone. This date field shall contain the local date for the region submitting the request. Edit checks on the IAFIS will accept the local date as valid up to 1 day forward (24 hours), in order to accommodate the variance between international time zones. POA 10.021 - POSE OFFSET ANGLE. This field shall only be used for the exchange of facial image data if Field 10.020 (POS) contains an "A" to indicate an angled pose of the subject. For a full face or a profile this field should be omitted. This ASCII field specifies the pose position of the subject at any possible orientation within a circle. Its value shall be to a nearest degree. The offset angle shall be measured from the full- face pose position and have a range of values from -180 degrees to + 180 degrees. A positive angle is used to express the angular offset as the subject rotates from a full- face pose to their right (approaching a left profile). A negative angle is used to express the angular offset as the subject rotates from a full- face pose to their left (approaching a right profile). If the entry in the POS field is an "F", "L", or "R", the contents of this field are ignored. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 K-2 May 2, 2005

POS 10.020 - SUBJECT POSE. This is an optional field to be used for the exchange of facial image data. When included, this field shall contain a one ASCII character code selected from the list below to describe the pose of the subject. For the angled pose entry "A", field 10.021 (POA)

shall contain the offset angle from the full face orientation. Full Face Frontal Right Profile (90 degree) Left Profile (90 degree) Angled Pose F R L A

PXS 10.022 - PHOTO DESCRIPTION. This optional ASCII field shall be used for the exchange of facial image data. When present, it shall describe special attributes of the captured facial image. Attributes associated with the facial image may be selected from the following values and entered in this field. Subject Wearing Glasses Subject Wearing Hat Subject Wearing Scarf Physical Characteristics Other Characteristics GLASSES HAT SCARF PHYSICAL OTHER

Physical characteristics, such as "freckles" may be entered as a subfield consisting of two information items. The first is "PHYSICAL" followed by the US separator, followed by the characteristics as listed in Part 4 Section 13 of the NCIC Code Manual. The "OTHER" category is used to enter unlisted or miscellaneous attributes of the facial image. This information shall be entered as two information item subfield. This first is "OTHER" followed by the US separator, followed by the unformatted text used to describe the attribute. Multiple attributes and subfields may be listed but must be separated by the RS character. SLC 10.008 - SCALE UNITS. This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the units used to describe the image sampling frequency (pixels density). A "1" in this field indicates pixels per inch. A "2" indicates pixels centimeter. A "0" in this field indicates no scale is given, for this case, the quotient of HPS/VPS give the pixel aspect ratio. SRC 10.004 - SOURCE AGENCY/ORI. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the identification of the administration or organization that originally captured the facial image contained in the record. Normally, the ORI of the agency that captured the image will be contained in this field. The size and data content of this field shall be denied by the user and be in accordance with the receiving agency. VLL 10.007 - VERTICAL LINE LENGTH. This mandatory ASCII shall contain the number of horizontal lines contained in the transmitted image. IAFIS-DOC-01078-7.1 K-3 May 2, 2005

VPS 10.010 - VERTICAL PIXEL SCALE. This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the pixel density used in the vertical direction providing the SLC contains a "1" or a "2". Otherwise, it indicates the vertical component of the pixel aspect ratio.

APPENDIX L SUMMARY TABLES

This append ix contains several tables that collect in one place summaries of information that otherwise is dispersed through the EFTS document. Tables L-1 and L-2 cross-reference all currently used EFTS elements from their Element IDs to their Tag Numbers. The crossreferences appear in two ways. Table L-1 lists the fields in Element ID order. Table L-2 lists them in Tag Number order. In several instances Tag Numbers shown have alpha suffixes. These suffixes are given only to make the list complete (i.e., to inc lude subfields as well as simple elements in the list) and to aid in determination of what the parent field is in such cases. For example, the field tag 2.084A identifies this ( FGP) as a subfield of AMP (2.084). Under no circumstance is a subfield tag to be used in formatting any EFTS electronic message. Subfields do not have independent tags, either with or without an alpha suffix. Tables L-3 and L-4 list recordset requirements for each EFTS transaction type. Table L-3 lists the recordset requirements for each type of submission. Table L-4 lists recordset requirements for each response type. In instances where these requirements differ depending upon which submission the response is made for, several entries will be present. Note that the Type-4 requirements for Ten-print submissions is stated to be 14. If less than 14 images are submitted, each missing image must be noted in the AMP field of the accompanying Type-2 record. The TPIS and TPFS indicate that N-10 Type-4 or Type-9 records, respectively, are to be submitted. The number N is the minimum number of fingers required by AFIS for a search, and is currently not known.

APPENDIX N CIVIL BACKGROUND CHECKS USING FLAT IMPRESSIONS DESCRIPTORS AND FIELD EDIT SPECIFICATIONS FOR TYPE-14 LOGICAL RECORDS This section presents the descriptors and field specifications for Type-14 logical records used with flats based civil background checks. The flat- fingerprint impressions are contained in three Type-14 image records. Two of the image records contain the left and right simultaneous four fingers, and the third contains the two thumbs. Offsets to the locations of image segments containing the individual fingers are included with the image records. Most of the following definitions are taken from the ANSI Standard, Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial, & Scar Mark & Tattoo (SMT) Information (ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000).

BPX 14.012--BITS PER PIXEL. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of bits used to represent a pixel. This field shall contain an entry of .8. for normal grayscale values of .0. to .255.. CGA 14.011--COMPRESSION ALGORITHM. This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the algorithm used to compress grayscale images. An entry of "NONE" in this field indicates that the data contained in this record is uncompressed. For those images that are to be compressed, this field shall contain "WSQ" the preferred method for the compression of tenprint- fingerprint images. COM 14.020--COMMENT. This optional field may be used to insert comments or other ASCII text information with the ten-print image data. DAT 14.999--IMAGE DATA. This field shall contain all of the data from a captured ten-print image. It shall always be assigned field number 999 and must be the last physical field in the record. For example, .14.999:. is followed by image data in a binary representation. Each pixel of uncompressed grayscale data shall be quantized to eight bits (256 gray levels) contained in a single byte. If compression is used, the pixel data shall be compressed in accordance wit h the compression technique specified in the CGA field. FGP 14.013--FINGER POSITION. This mandatory tagged- field shall contain finger position code that matches the ten-print image. The decimal code number corresponding to the known or most probable finger position shall be taken from Table 1 and entered as a one- or two-character ASCII subfield. Table 1 also lists the maximum image area that can be transmitted for each of the fourteen possible finger positions.

HLL 14.006--HORIZONTAL LINE LENGTH. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of pixels contained on a single horizontal line of the transmitted image. HPS 14.009--HORIZONTAL PIXEL SCALE. This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the horizontal direction providing the SLC contains a "1" or a "2." Otherwise, it indicates the horizontal component of the pixel aspect ratio. IDC 14.002--IMAGE DESIGNATION CHARACTER. This mandatory ASCII field shall be used to identify the ten-print- fingerprint image contained in the record. This IDC shall match the IDC found in the file content (CNT) field of the Type-1 record. IMP 14.003--IMPRESSION TYPE. This mandatory one-byte ASCII field shall indicate the manner by which the ten-print image information was obtained. The appropriate code selected from Table 2 shall be entered in this field. IQM 14.022--IMAGE QUALITY METRIC. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the image quality scores for the individual fingers. Each finger score is defined by the FINGER NUMBER and the QUALITY SCORE separated by the <US> separator. Individual finger quality definitions are separated by the <RS> separator.

LEN 14.001--LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the total count of the number of bytes in the Type-14 logical record. Field 14.001 shall specify the length of the record, including every character of every field contained in the record, and the information separators. SEG 14.021--FINGER SEGMENT POSITION(s). This mandatory ASCII field shall contain offsets to the locations of image segments containing the ind ividual fingers within the image. The offsets are relative to the origin, (0,0), which is in the upper left corner of the image. The horizontal offsets (X) are the pixel counts to the right, and the vertical offsets (Y) are the pixel counts down. A finger segment is defined by the FINGER NUMBER, the X coordinates (LEFT, RIGHT) and the Y coordinates (TOP, BOTTOM), of its bounding box. The five information items within a finger segment definition are separated by the <US> separator. Individual finger segment definitions are separated by the <RS> separator. SLC 14.008--SCALE UNITS. This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the units used to describe the image sampling frequency (pixel density). A "1" in this field indicates pixels per inch, or a 2" indicates pixels per centimeter. A "0" in this field indicates no scale is given. For this case, the quotient of HPS/VPS gives the pixel aspect ratio. SRC 14.004--SOURCE AGENCY. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the identification of the administration or organization that originally captured the ten-print image contained in the record. Normally, the ORI of the agency that captured the image will be contained in this field. The SRC may contain up to 20 identifying characters. The data content of this field shall be defined by the user and be in accordance with the receiving agency. TCD 14.005--TEN-PRINT CAPTURE DATA. This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the date that the ten-print image was captured. The date shall appear as eight digits in the format CCYYMMDD. The CCYY characters shall represent the year the image was captured; the MM characters shall be the tens and units values of the month; and the DD characters shall be the tens and units values of the day in the month. For example, the entry 20000229 represents February 29, 2000. The complete date must be a legitimate date.

BMA AND BRA FIELD CODES

SECTION 4--BOAT MAKE (BMA) AND BRAND NAME (BRA) FIELD CODES 4.1 BMA AND BRA FIELD Boats manufactured in the United States (except military vessels) have a three-character U.S. Coast Guard manufacturer's identification code as the first three characters of the manufacturer's assigned boat hull number. Some large manufacturers who have several boat building plants have been assigned multiple codes by the U.S. Coast Guard. When entering a record for a boat made by such a manufacturer, the BMA Field code should agree with the first three characters of the boat hull number. Canadian manufacturers may apply to the U.S. Coast Guard for a manufacturer's identification code. If the U.S. Coast Guard assigns a code, it will begin with the alphabetic Z. Section 4.2 contains BMA and BRA Field Codes for boat and boat part manufacturers. For Boat File records, if a code is not listed, the code MISC should be entered as characters 1 through 4 of the BMA Field with the actual manufacturer's name appearing in positions 5 through 24. If the manufacturer's name is not known, positions 5 through 24 of the BMA Field should be used to describe the boat including any information which can lead to the determination of the manufacturer's name. If a brand name for a part is not listed, a Vehicle/Boat Part File record may be entered using the generic code PART in the BRA Field with information concerning the manufacturer placed in the Miscellaneous Field. For unlisted makes, the CJIS Division staff should be contacted at 304-625-3000 for code assignments.

MAK FIELD CODES

GUN DATA CODES SECTION 1--MAKE (MAK) FIELD CODES 1.1 MAK FIELD Section 1.5 contains MAK Field codes listed alphabetically by gun manufacturer. If a make is not listed, the code ZZZ should be entered as characters 1 through 3 of the MAK Field with the actual manufacturer's name appearing in positions 4 through 23. This manufacuter's name will appear as entered in any record repose. If the MAK Field code is ZZZ and positions 4 through 23 are blank, the MAK Field will be translated as MAK/UNKNOWN in the record response. For unlisted makes, the CJIS Division staff should be contacted at 304-625-3000 for code assignments. Additional coding instructions can be found in the Gun File chapter of the NCIC 2000 Operating Manual. 1.2 MAK FIELD CODE FOR U.S. MILITARY-ISSUE WEAPONS For firearms (including surplus weapons) that are U.S. military-issue weapons, the MAK Field code USA should be used. Common U.S. military-issue weapons include the following:
U.S. Military-Issue Weapons .45 caliber and/or 9 mm U.S. Submachine Guns: M1, M1A1, M1928, M1928A1 (Thompson), M50, M55 (Reising), M42 (United Defense), M3, M3A1 ("Grease Gun") .45 caliber U.S. (Colt) Pistols, M1911, and 1911A1 .45 caliber U.S. Revolvers, M1917 .30 caliber U.S. Carbines, M1, M2, M3 7.62 mm U.S. Rifle, M14 .30 caliber U.S. Machine Guns (including the BAR, etc.) .410-gauge and/or .22 U.S. Survival Guns, M4 and M6 U.S. Military-Issue Weapons 5.56 mm U.S. Rifle, M16 and M16A1, etc. .30 caliber U.S. Rifles: Models 1892, 94, 96, 98 (Krag); Models 1903 and 1903A3, etc. (Springfield); M1 (Garand); and M1917 (Enfield)

1.3

MAK FIELD CODES FOR NONMILITARY U.S. GOVERNMENT WEAPONS For a nonmilitary weapon bearing a U.S. Government property inscription and the manufacturer's name on the frame or receiver, the appropriate manufacturer's MAK Field code from Section 1.5 should be used. For example, MAK/SW should be used for Smith & Wesson, and MAK/CLT should be used for Colt revolvers bearing the inscription U.S. Border patrol, Naval Investigative Service, U.S. Air Force, Treasury Department, etc.

1.4

MAK FIELD FOR FOREIGN MILITARY WEAPONS Foreign military firearms should be coded according to the make on the firearm. If the make is undeterminable, codes should be selected according to the country where the gun was manufactured. If neither the make nor the country where manufactured is known, additional information concerning coding can be found in the Gun File chapter in the NCIC 2000 Operating Manual.

CAL FIELD CODES

SECTION 2--CALIBER (CAL) FIELD CODES 2.1 CAL FIELD CODES Firearms are identified by make, model, serial number, type (rifle, shotgun, etc.), and cartridge-type designation. Cartridge types are most often expressed in calibers (decimals of an inch) or in millimeters, for example the .357 Magnum and 9 mm Luger. It is also possible for the same cartridge to have both an English and a metric designation. For example, the .308 Winchester is also known as the 7.62x51 NATO. A weapon with this cartridge-type designation could be entered using either the CAL 308 or 762. Entries should be made based on the markings on the weapon. Many ammunition and weapon manufacturers name cartridge types after the company. One example is the 7 mm Remington Magnum that was developed by the Remington Arms Company. The manufacturer associated with a cartridge type should not be confused with the make of the firearm. For example, the .38 Smith & Wesson (S&W) Special cartridge was developed by Smith & Wesson, but many companies manufacture weapons chambered for this cartridge type. The Caliber (CAL) Field is intended to contain the broad cartridge-type designation of a firearm. Because of the volume of cartridge types and the differing methods of measurement used (English, metric, or gauge) in identifying them, the table below has been prepared to assist in data entry. The "CAL" column contains the CAL codes, and the "Common Names/Examples" column contains common cartridge-type designation examples. In cases of ambiguity in cartridge-type designations, further identifying information, if available, should be placed in the Miscellaneous (MIS) Field. Users will note that some cartridge types have more than one designation. Additionally, due to existing programming, the NCIC 2000 System does not distinguish between some cartridge types with similar designations. The .308 Winchester/7.62x51 NATO, as noted above, could be entered as either 308 or 762. If entered as 762, no distinction between a 7.62x51 NATO, a 7.62x39 Soviet, or a 7.62 mm Tokarev would be made. Users should be aware of this when making Gun File inquiries, especially if an inquiry leads to multiple hits on firearms with similar cartridge-type designations.
CAL 6 Common Names/Examples 6 mm Remington, .243 Winchester, .240 Weatherby Magnum 7 mm Remington Magnum, 7 mm Bench Rest, 7 mm-08, 7 mm Weatherby Magnum, 7x57 Mauser, 7.7 Arisaka, .280 Remington, etc. 8x57 Mauser, 8 mm Lebel, 8 mm Remington Magnum 9 mm Luger/Parabellum/9x19, 9 mm Kurz/Corto/9x17 (.380 ACP), 9 mm Winchester Magnum, 9 mm Browning Long, 9 mm Steyr, 9 mm BergmannBayard, 9 mm Makarov/9x18, 9x21, 9x23/Largo, etc. 224 CAL 10 Common Names/Examples 10 mm, .40 S&W pistol cartridges; also used for 10-gauge shotgun 11 mm Mauser 12.5 mm is metric for .50-caliber Browning Machine Gun round; also used for 12-gauge shotgun 13 mm Gyrojet rocket pistol/carbine .17 Remington .22 Short/Long/Long Rifle rimfire cartridge family; also .22 Hornet, .22-250, .220 Swift, .222 Remington, .223 Remington, etc. DECEMBER 2000/NCIC 2000

CAL FIELD CODES FOR SHOTGUNS The gauge system of bore measurement is unique and totally different from the English caliber or metric methods of measurement. Shotgun gauges are normally expressed as whole numbers, followed by the word "gauge" or an abbreviation for it, for example 12-gauge or 12-ga. Under the English system of shotgun gauges, the lower the numerical value, the larger the bore diameter. With most common shotgun cartridge types, the bore diameter when expressed in decimals of an inch or millimeters is not the same as the gauge. A 12-gauge's bore diameter is not .12 caliber; nor is it 12 millimeters. The exception is the 410-gauge; it is a true .41-caliber bore diameter. There are also metric designations in use (listed below), but these will usually be designated in millimeters or with the abbreviation "mm." The appropriate gauge should be entered in the CAL Field. Some shotgun gauges are numerically the same as some calibers, especially metric designations. The weapon type should be designated in the Type (TYP) Field to eliminate any confusion.

GUN DATA CODES

TYP FIELD CODES Gun Type Pistol, Automatic Code -Comments Keeps firing as long as the trigger is held back. Originally designed as a handgun, it has a selector switch that allows it to be fully automatic and may be fitted with a shoulder stock. Should not be confused with semiautomatic pistol. A fully automatic pistol should be coded with TYP code B. Example: Remington Model XP-100. Small handgun that may be single-shot (one barrel) or two shot (double-barreled). A muzzle-loading handgun fired by the action of a piece of flint held in the hammer jaws. Example: 13 mm Gyrojet handgun manufactured by MB Associates. Black-powder handgun fired by the hammer striking a percussion cap as opposed to a flintlock or modern metallic cartridge ammunition. Uses a cylinder to retain the cartridges in the weapon. Also known as autoloading or self-loading. Often incorrectly referred to as "automatic." Fires only one shot with each pull of the trigger. Examples: .45-caliber U.S. 1911A1 pistol, German Luger. A pistol having no magazine and loaded with only one cartridge at a time. Any rifle having the capability of fully-automatic fire but which is not a machine gun or submachine gun. Examples: U.S. M16, Soviet SKS, AK-47 assault rifles, U.S. M14 rifle. Uses a turn-bolt mechanism to load, fire, and extract/eject cartridges. A short, lightweight shoulder weapon not capable of fully automatic fire. Example: .30-caliber U.S. M1 Carbine. A muzzle-loading rifle fired by the action of a piece of flint held in the hammer jaws. Lever-action repeating rifles only. Does not include single-shot weapons that use a lever.

TYP FIELD CODES Gun Type Rifle, Percussion Code RU Comments Black-powder rifles fired by the hammer striking a percussion cap as opposed to a flintlock or modern metallic cartridge ammunition. Also known as "slide" or "trombone." Action is operated by a sliding pull-push fore-end usually located beneath the barrel. Also known as autoloading or self-loading. Often incorrectly referred to as an "automatic." Fires only one shot with each pull of the trigger. Examples: .30-caliber U.S. M1 Rifle, Ruger .44-caliber carbine. A rifle other than bolt-action having no magazine and loaded with only one cartridge at a time. Examples: Ruger No. 1 Rifle, Winchester High Wall. Refers to a shoulder-fired weapon that combines both rifle and shotgun barrels in one firearm. One of the better known is the Drilling, a side-by-side shotgun with an attached rifle barrel located below and between the two shotgun barrels. Many imported combination guns designed for the U.S. market are known as turkey guns. Examples: bazooka, light antitank weapon A shotgun using a turnbolt mechanism. A shotgun having two barrels arranged side-byside. A shotgun having barrels aligned one on top of the other. Though technically a double-barrel, the latter term is reserved for those having a side-byside configuration. If an over and under weapon has one rifle barrel and one shotgun barrel, it should be coded C (rifle-shotgun combination). Also known as "slide" and "trombone." Action operated by a sliding pull-push fore-end, usually located beneath the barrel. Examples: Winchester Model 12, Remington 870, Ithaca Model 37. Also known as autoloading or self-loading and incorrectly as an "automatic." Fires only one shot with each pull of the trigger. Examples: Browning automatic shotgun, Remington Model 1100.

For example: SMITH, JOHN HENRY SMITH, JOHN HENRY JR SMITH, JOHN H Q SMITH, JOHN HENRY LEWIS Complete names are to be used if available. No unit of a name or alias should be abbreviated unless the complete name exceeds the 30-character maximum field length. Should a name exceed the maximum field length, the initial(s) of the middle name(s) should be used rather than the full middle name(s). When entering records for persons with only one name, the only name as the surname and an alphabetic X as the first name should be used. Abbreviations such as FNU, IO, LNU, MNU, NMI, and NMN should not be used. Titles or degrees of individuals, including foreign titles and degrees, and their abbreviations (Mr., Miss, Mrs., Ms., Prof., Ph.D., Capt., Lt., D.D.S., Dr., Rev., etc.) are not used in the NAM Field; however, a title or degree may be included as an alias when it is known or believed the title or degree may be used by the individual when identifying him/herself. Its location is the same as (or following) data showing seniority. For example: BROWN, JOHN WILLIAM REV SMITH, ROBERT L MRS Apostrophes (O'Neal, O'Boyle) should be eliminated. Names appearing in VGTOF QGM inquiries and as VGTOF supplemental AKAs may be entered without using commas as monikers may be used.

SECTION 14--FINGERPRINT CLASSIFICATION (FPC) FIELD CODES 14.1 FPC FIELD CODES The FPC is comprised of 20 characters. Two characters represent each finger as follows:
Positions 1 and 2 3 and 4 5 and 6 7 and 8 9 and 10 11 and 12 13 and 14 15 and 16 17 and 18 19 and 20 Finger Right thumb Right index Right middle Right ring Right little Left thumb Left index Left middle Left ring Left little

When the FPC Field is coded using data from III records the following apply: · The FINGERPRINT CLASS is furnished on two lines. The first line represents the fingerprint classification of the right hand. The second line represents the left hand. The FPC Field should be coded using the information from the first line as positions 1 through 10 and the second line as positions 11 through 20. The PATTERN CLASS is furnished on one, two, or three lines. The entire first line information should be used in positions 1 through 20 of the FPC Field. When both classifications are available, the FINGERPRINT CLASS for FPC coding should be used.

·

·

The following codes apply to the FINGERPRINT CLASS:
Pattern Type ArchS))) Pattern Subgroup Plain Arch Tented Arch LoopS))) Radial Loop FPC Code AA TT Two numeric characters. Determine actual ridge count and add fifty (50). For example, if the ridge count of a radial loop is 16, add 50 to 16 for a sum of 66. Enter this sum (66) in the appropriate finger position of the FPC Field. Two numeric characters indicating actual ridge count (less than 50). For example, a ridge count of 14, enter as 14; a ridge count of 9, enter as 09.

6

Code SR is used in instances in which the fingerprint cannot be accurately classified because of complete scarring or mutilation and a classifiable print cannot be obtained. As in the case of missing and amputated fingers, the procedure for assigning the classification of the opposite finger, as is done under the Henry System, should not be used for the NCIC FPC.
7

Code XX is used in instances of missing and totally/partly amputated fingers where conditions make it impossible to accurately classify an impression according to the above instructions for NCIC FPC. It is recognized that under the Henry System, if a finger is missing or amputated, it is given a classification identical to the opposite finger; however, this must not be done in the NCIC FPC since the location of finger or fingers missing/amputated is not indicated.

FPC FIELD FOR UNIDENTIFIED PERSON FILE RECORDS Classifying fingerprints for unidentified person record entries is the exception to the instructions in Section 14.1. The exceptions are as follows: · The code NA is used when a finger cannot be printed because it has been amputated and not found with the body, and the amputation of the finger was related to the death of the individual. Antemortem amputations that are not related to the death of the individual are indicated by using the code XX (missing/amputated). · The code NA is also used when a finger cannot be printed because it is burned or mutilated and the burning or mutilation was related to the death of the individual. Antemortem burns, mutilations, and scars that are not related to the death of the individual are indicated by using the code SR (scarred/mutilated). · If all ten of the deceased individual's fingers have been amputated and not found with the body, burned, or mutilated, and the amputation, burning, or mutilation is related to the death of the individual, the code NFP may be entered in the FPC Field. The NCIC computer will convert the code NFP to ten NAs for insertion in the FPC Field.

U.S. military services are now using Social Security Numbers (SOCs) to identify military personnel. This use applies to active duty, reserve, and retired servicemen. This number should be entered in both the MNU and SOC Fields . For example, if a subject has SOC 420-19-0210 and Army Serial Number 420190210, the SOC would be entered in the SOC Field as 420190210, and the Army Serial Number would be entered in the MNU Field as AS-420190210.

SECTION 16--SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SOC) FIELD A SOC in an entry or inquiry must be shown without dashes; for example, SOC 420-19-0210 would appear in the SOC Field as 420190210.

SECTION 17--OPERATOR'S LICENSE DATA 17.1 OPERATOR'S LICENSE DATA Information from a license issued to operate a motor vehicle or a license issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate an aircraft may be entered.

When information from a pilot's license is entered, a comment must be made in the MIS Field indicating that the license is not a motor vehicle operator's license. For example: OLN IS PILOTS LIC OLN/PILOTS LIC Expired license information may be entered when current data are not available. 17.2 OPERATOR'S LICENSE NUMBER (OLN) FIELD The complete license number is to be entered omitting spaces, hyphens, and symbols. Any alphabetic characters which are part of the license number must be entered. 17.3 OPERATOR'S LICENSE STATE (OLS) FIELD The appropriate two-character alphabetic code for the jurisdiction (state, territory, province, etc.) or foreign country which issued the license should be entered. (OLS Field codes are the same as POB Field codes. Appropriate codes can be found in the State and Country Data Codes chapter of this manual.) The code US should be used for license state of a pilot's license issued by the FAA. For a pilot's license issued by a foreign country, the appropriate code from the State and Country Data Codes chapter of this manual should be entered. 17.4 OPERATOR'S LICENSE YEAR OF EXPIRATION (OLY) FIELD The four digits of the highest year in which the operator's license is valid (YYYY) should be entered. NX indicates that an operator's license is nonexpiring; that is, indefinitely valid or valid until revoked. If the year of expiration is unknown, but the OLN and state of issue are known, the current year may be entered as the year of expiration if the correct year of expiration cannot be obtained from the issuing state.

SECTION 25--CORRECTIVE VISION PRESCRIPTION (VRX) FIELD CODES The VRX Field may contain up to 40 characters and any character in the NCIC character set (except for the period) to indicate the appropriate corrective vision prescription for the individual. A vision prescription usually contains two sets of values, one for the right lens and one for the left lens. The prescription for the right lens is usually prefixed with the characters OD or R. The prescription for the left lens is usually prefixed with the characters OS or L. Each prescription may contain up to five elements which describe the sphere, cylinder, axis, add (for bifocals), and prisms of the lens. Most prescriptions for juveniles will contain only the sphere, cylinder, and axis. The VRX Field is to be coded exactly as the prescription was written by the ophthalmologist, optometrist, optician, or laboratory technician. However, the NCIC computer will not accept some of the symbols used in prescriptions. In these instances, the following codes to should be used for symbol entry.
Prescription Symbol . (decimal) = (equals) x (times)

Code D E X

The following are examples of vision prescriptions and proper coding for the VRX Field. Rx OD-2.50=-.25x90 OS-2.00=-.25x95 Rx R-1.75-.25x100 L-1.50-.25x85 Rx OD PL=+1.00x180 OS+3.00=+1.00x170 VRX/OD-2D50E-D25X90 OS-2D00E-D25X95

VRX/OD PLE+1D00X180 OS+3D00E+1D00X170

If the vision prescription contains more than 40 characters, the right lens information should be entered in the VRX Field and the left lens information should be entered in the MIS Field. For example: Rx OD-12.00=-.25x140 .5 Degrees Base Up OS-12.50=-.25x120 .5 Degrees Base Down VRX/OD-12D00E-D25X140 D5 DEGREES BASE UP MIS/OS-12D50E-D25X120 D5 DEGREES BASE DOWN

Executive Summary
TSA's Office of Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC) was established to conduct risk assessments and mitigation activities to prevent disruption to the Nation's transportation system by terrorist or other national security threats. The TTAC Infrastructure Modernization Program (TIM) supports TSA's mission by significantly improving the vetting management and adjudication platform. The TIM system received initial funding FY 2010 and is scheduled for completion during FY 15 as outlined in section 1 of this document. Section 2 includes Mission Requirements to include basic operating requirements. The TIM system will unify through a Service Oriented Architecture which allows for sharing and reuse of applications and services. Section 3 lists the effectiveness requirements for TIM. In addition, the system will promote interoperability between DHS enterprise, state and federal governments using enterprise core services as well as open standards where applicable. Section 4 provides the suitability requirements for TIM. Included in this section are the integrated logistics plan, system reliability and availability, as well as survivability and personnel safety. Section 5 lists the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) which are parameters considered essential for mission accomplishment. The KPPs measurements include Enrollment, Response Time, Operational Availability and Security and Privacy.

Introduction

Purpose

This Operational Requirements Document (ORD) serves as the master planning document that describes functions necessary to successfully achieve the operational goals of the TTAC Modernization program. The TIM Program will provide the mission capabilities defined in the TTAC Mission Need Statement (MNS) approved by TSA on April 28, 2009. 1.2 Background

The TIM program will modernize the current TTAC infrastructure to meet the mission capabilities and scale it to meet the mission needs of future populations. This is achieved by eliminating redundant business practices, processes, and subsequent IT investments to achieve significant economies of scale associated with a unifying business integration effort. By reengineering and/or replacing the existing stove-piped business processes and information systems the TIM Program will be able to:       Consolidate multiple enrollment methods Implement identity management services across programs Standardize the approach for customer relationship management Standardize the physical and virtual credentialing processes Standardize threat assessment processes; and Consolidate operations by integrating program-specific information technology (IT) systems and business processes into a common secure enterprise vetting and credentialing architecture.

The system will interact with US Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology (USVISIT), US Citizen and Immigration Service (USCIS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) and US Federal critical infrastructure and others as appropriate. The System will use a Service Oriented Architecture approach for the newly designed system. Full Operational Capability will be achieved once all populations have been migrated to the TIM system.

1.3.2 Incremental Operational Capability Date(s) The system will be developed in a block approach. There are three primary blocks which will be developed / maintained in accordance with the Programs acquisition strategy and plan. The first block, which supports the development of Service Oriented Architecture framework, will contain six month builds which will deliver enrollment, security threat assessment, adjudication, redress, and trend analytics capabilities. The developmental contractor will be tasked with structuring these six month builds within each of the blocks. Each build will conduct functional testing consistent with the Testing and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) prior to moving to the next build. The program will follow DHS Directive 026-06 Test and Evaluation. IOC will be achieved in August, 2013 with the deployment of Block 1. 1.3.3 Full Operational Capability Date Full Operational Capability is estimated in August, 2015 with the integration of maritime, surface, aviation and other nascent populations. 1.3.4 Other Key Dates Initial duration of block 1 is estimated at 24 months with four six month builds. The order in which capabilities are to be built will be proposed by the contractor and reviewed and accepted by the government.

Mission Requirements

The primary objectives of the TIM Program are to move from providing compartmentalized, multi-process vetting and credentialing services to a person-centric system that results in an integrated end-to-end capability to manage identities, credentials, and assessment results for millions of transportation sector workers. The TIM Program mission is to provide the following capabilities: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Offer enrollment and credentialing services that provide the requisite credentials used by individuals who have successfully cleared Security Threat Assessment (STA) to gain unescorted access to special, sterile, and/or secured areas in TSA regulated locations. Offer screening services to allow unescorted access to special, sterile, and/or secured areas where credentials may not be provided or required. Provide the means to recurrently vet (check daily) 50 million individuals against the federal watch list. Engage a wide range of transportation stakeholders requiring secure credentials to address current and emerging threats to the transportation industry. Perform end-to-end program management for aviation, maritime, surface programs, and other future populations with core capabilities in enrollment services, vetting operations, adjudication, and credential management.

The System will reduce the cost, risk, and time associated with implementing new capabilities, on-boarding new populations, improving the system architecture, meet mission generated surge & processing capabilities and operations and maintenance. In this effort, TTAC will consolidate the management of all vetting and credentialing programs within TTAC, including but not limited to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ 2.1 Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) Hazardous Material Endorsement Threat Assessment Program (HTAP) Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP) Aviation Workers (AW) Crew Vetting (CVP) and other Vetting/Screening Administration and Operations Programs Indirect Air Carrier General Aviation Operating Requirements

Key operational performance goals of the TIM Program are to improve and to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of transportation security threat assessments. The system will leverage existing program-level infrastructure components for expanded use by all TTAC programs, while maintaining current system reliability, availability, and production capabilities and utilize DHS-wide services, such as IDENT (US-VISIT), SAVE (USCIS) and TECS (CBP).

The system shall:       2.2 trace and record each unique applicant check across all new and existing TTAC populations for multiple applications per applicant flag and report all STA's and credentials held by applicant produce tamper-resistant credentials to support multiple licenses, privileges, or statuses within a single physical credential provide one enrollment interface for all TTAC programs provide edit, modify, and delete functions for all applicant information Concept of Operations

For individuals applying for a particular benefit or privilege offered by a TIM program or a vetting service by TSA, the individual will be able to initiate registration and enrollment via a common enrollment portal. A person's completed enrollment package will enter a screening process. A vetting request will be sent and the applicant will be vetted against derogatory datasets. After the initial scoring and analysis of the vetting process, there may be further required adjudication for the case. The system will alert pertinent parties for the production of physical credentials. The level of the assurance of a person's identity, the authenticity of the submission, and the status and validity of the credential will be managed within the verification and use phase of the credentialing lifecycle. This phase includes efforts such as electronic verification, that will be taken to terminate a valid license, privilege, or status and the associated credential based on new information or expiration. Analytics allow analysts to select from a standardized suite of analysis tools or compose customized processing sequences that can be shared across the TTAC analysis enterprise.

Section 4

Suitability Requirements

The system shall be available 24 hours per day 7 days a week. 4.1 Design

The system will utilize COTS technology where possible to maximize flexible business processes, business rules, and a content management framework. 4.2 Integrated Logistics Support

The system will be initially supported and sustained through a two-year Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) warranty, during which the OEM provides support for each end item delivered. The TIM Help Desk will document every maintenance action in a database and report it monthly to the TSA for evaluation to determine whether the contractor meets performance requirements and to monitor and assess actual versus expected system performance. Maintenance actions include preventive and corrective maintenance actions performed by a contractor Field Service Technician (FST). The OEM will be required to coordinate scheduled outages with the Operations Center and notify the TIM Help Desk of the approved outage. The maintenance database captures all failures and discrepancies. Based on the database maintenance actions, the TSA requires the TIM Help Desk to calculate and report required Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) performance metrics monthly to ensure compliance with the supportability and sustainment requirements. These include Operational Availability (Ao), Mean Downtime (MDT), Mean Uptime (MUT), Mean Time Between Critical Failures (MTBCF), and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) for the TSE. Rationale: The system needs to support the TSA effort to provide reliable maintenance service. 4.3 Reliability

Reliability is the probability of the completion of a mission of duration a rolling twelve month cycle. In the operational environment, the TSA uses the MTBCF. The TSA considers a critical failure as a failure which prevents the system from performing its intended function and cannot be cleared by operator intervention alone; the fault requires a call to maintenance. MTBCF is computed as: MTBCF = Total Operating Hours Number of Critical Failures

The system shall be designed to meet a minimum of 1,468 hours MTBCF in an intended operational environment (O). This is calculated assuming a 24-hour duty day. Rationale: The system needs to be reliable to justify the use of the equipment as a primary credentialing device. This means at a minimum the system cannot go down more than once every 4 months. The value is calculated off of a 24-hour duty day as this is the most common duty day for the credential sites.

Operational Requirements Document Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing Infrastructure Modernization

Page 10

4.4

Availability

Ao is the percentage of time, over a period during operational hours, that a system is available to perform its required mission. It reflects all potential causes of downtime, such as administrative downtime, logistic downtime, etc, and total operational uptime of the system. Ao is computed as: Ao = Uptime *100 Uptime + Downtime

The system shall maintain an Ao threshold of at least 97 percent (T)/99 percent (O). For calculations, the normal duty day is considered to be 24 hours per day. Rationale: The TSA requires a high degree of equipment availability for system operation. The value is calculated off of a 24-hour duty day as this is the most common duty day for system operation. 4.5 Maintainability

For determining the Maintainability of system for calculating Ao in the operational environment, the TSA considers the total operational time that a TSE is not in a condition to perform its required mission. This includes the time from the initial notification of the critical failure until the time the system is ready for acceptance and signoff by the TSA. MDT is calculated by dividing the total operating time that a system is not in a condition to perform its required mission by the number of failures over a given period. The design MTTR of the TSE is the actual corrective maintenance time to repair the TSE. This includes only the time from when the technician is ready to start the repair (parts and tools in place) to when the repaired TSE is ready for acceptance and signoff by the TSA.

MTTR =

Total Active Corrective Maintenance Time Number of Maintenance Actions

Where: Total Active Corrective Maintenance Time = Duration of Corrective Maintenance adjusted for airport operating hours. The time in which an airport is shutdown and maintenance cannot be conducted will not be counted as repair time. Rationale: The system needs to be able to be repaired in a sufficient amount of time to meet the reliability and availability requirements in order to justify the use of the equipment as a primary passenger screening device. The MDT will be managed through a maintenance contract to ensure the MDT does not go above an acceptable operational limit.

Personnel, Safety, Human Factors, and Environmental Considerations

The system shall comply with TSA Management Directive 2400.1 Occupational Safety and Health Program. The system shall comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 4.7 Training Requirements

The emphasis of the operational training requirements will be based on the new system criteria rather than on specific curricula or content. An extensible set of Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) will structure the operational training requirements. The new courses will contain syllabi, performance testing criteria for knowledge gained, and hands on applications of the new system for applying skills and abilities.

Section 5: Key Performance Parameters
Key Performance Parameters (KPP) are those system capabilities or characteristics considered essential for successful mission accomplishment. 5.1 Selection Criteria

In order to contribute to the achievement of the stated DHS goals and objectives, the system must address and eliminate redundant business practices, processes, and subsequent IT investments to achieve significant economies of scale while providing the benefits of a uniform, integrated credentialing and threat assessment structure capable of meeting future demand. Program metrics must measure progress towards achieving these program objectives. The system performance parameters include: Enroll Once ­ Use Many: A critical requirement of the program is to strive towards a person centric system that recognizes workers who may apply for multiple credentials, endorsement, or Security Threat Assessments (STA) to work in multiple transportation or commercial modes. This allows for the capability to use enrollment information once for multiple enrollments. By recognizing that a STA has been already completed the system will not charge the worker for the full STA service again. This comparability capability enhances the ability of TTAC to fully integrate enrollment information across all programs, transportation modes, and commercial entities and saves users time and money Security Threat Assessment Response Time: The processing time for the STA process, although dependent on other Agencies, has a significant impact on stakeholders and customers. The STA process uses the biometric and biographic information to conduct an immigration check with the USCIS SAVE system, a criminal history check and finger print check with the FBI Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS), and a terrorist watch list check with the vetting system located at the TTAC Colorado Springs Operations Center (CSOC). The approved STA is required for the worker to start/continue work or to apply for a job. Any significant delays in the STA process will impact the worker and may impact commerce. The STA processing time will become more critical as serviced populations continue to grow. Operational Availability: The operational availability of the systems, as does the STA process, has a significant impact on stakeholders and customers. The system redundancy, elimination of single points of failure, and redundant production facilities are critical in maintaining a level of operational availability that does not impact the worker or impact commerce within the maritime, surface, aviation, or other industries. Ensure Security and Privacy: Critical to the program is the management and full compliance to system security and handling of privacy information. As such the program will strive to meet all security and privacy requirements with no significant reported incidents. The critical performance parameters, and their minimum performance thresholds and objectives are summarized in Table 1 below.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC) Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) Program supports both DHS and TSA missions, by significantly improving the vetting and credentialing management and adjudication platform currently used for conducting security threat assessments (STAs) on various transportation populations. This is accomplished through the consolidation of legacy services, as well as through the use of software applications, and a common Information Technology (IT) infrastructure that includes consolidated knowledge based database architecture. The TIM Program presents an opportunity to eliminate redundant business practices, processes, and subsequent IT investments to achieve significant economies of scale associated with a unifying business integration effort. The TIM Program Office will address the profound stress placed upon the current TTAC system. As designed, the current architecture of TTAC enrollment, Identification (ID) management, vetting, adjudication, investigations, redress, credentialing infrastructure, and services was created to support and monitor 2.5 million individuals per year. Today, the TTAC system is stretched beyond its capacity, servicing 12.5 million individuals per year, while operating resources have not kept pace with the expansion. Future service requirements are expected to grow to 20 million individuals within the next 2 years, and expand to 40-50 million within the next five years. It is imperative that TTAC modernize and upgrade the present architecture to meet the current infrastructure requirements, as well as the very real projected infrastructure population requirements projected for the very near future. This Integrated Logistics Support Plan (ILSP) describes TIM Program Office approach for obtaining a highly supportable and sustainable capability for modernization of the TTAC architecture infrastructure and process. It documents the management approach, schedule, and funding requirements for integrating supportability and sustainment requirements into the overall TIM program process. Additionally, the ILSP describes the systems that are required to support the operational and logistical capabilities of the TIM System. As addressed in the ILSP, hardware maintenance includes on-site corrective actions, as well as a tiered help desk support process, which will operate 24/7. Software support responsibilities are incumbent upon the development contractor, and the maintenance schedule will be managed by the TIM PMO. All software will comply with TSA Naming Conventions and Standards. Configuration control will also be managed by the TIM PMO, however, change requests as well as other configuration controls will be governed by the TIM Management Review Board (MRB). All change requests identified in this ILSP will be managed by TIM Configuration Management (CM) Specialists. Staffing and personnel supporting the TIM System will have proper clearances and be trained in accordance with the descriptions outlined in this ILSP. The TIM Tailoring Plan outlines the system and engineering documentation that support the TIM System. Asset Management supports the monitoring, coordinating and acquisition of supplies and materials, while maintenance agreements will support this process. The TIM Program Manager oversees the TIM Integrated Product Team (IPT), which consists of representatives that directly report to the program manager, and representatives assigned to other organizations within the Office of Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing and throughout TSA. The Program Manager organizes the IPT to ensure development, testing, deployment, operation, safety, and life cycle supportability and sustainment are adequately addressed for each TIM acquisition. The Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) Manager is a matrixed member of the TIM IPT working within TTAC Life Cycle Support (LCS). The ILS manager is responsible for the development of all supportability and sustainment activities and initiates logistics planning early in the acquisition life cycle, working closely with the TIM IPT and other subject matter experts. The primary supportability and sustainment goal of the TIM Program Office is to establish a maintenance and support process that will enable the current and future TIM systems to meet or exceed the Operational Availability (Ao), as defined in the Operational Requirements Documents (ORD). Ao is the percentage of time, during operational hours, that the TIM system is available to perform its required mission.

6

The table below identifies ORD Ao goal.

Key Performance Parameter (KPP) Threshold Objective TIM Operational Availability (Ao) > 97% > 99%

The TIM sustainment concept will be defined in the Design and Development contract and will contain Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) from the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) or System Integrator for TIM equipment. Operational Availability (Ao) and Mean Down Time (MDT) are the Key Performance Parameters (KPP) used to determine contract compliance with CLS requirements. The CLS will document all maintenance actions in a database that is reported monthly to TSA for government evaluation to determine whether they meet contract KPP requirements, and to monitor and assess actual versus expected system performance. Maintenance actions include every preventive and corrective maintenance action performed by contractor Field Service Technicians (FST). The maintenance database captures all failures and discrepancies whether or not they are included in the contract KPP requirements.

SECTION A. INTRODUCTION AND PROGRAM SUMMARY 1.0 Background The primary objectives of the TIM Program are to move from providing compartmentalized, multi-process vetting and credentialing services to a person-centric system that results in an integrated end-to-end capability to manage identities, credentials, and assessment results for millions of transportation sector workers. This will be accomplished through the following capabilities: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Offer enrollment and credentialing services that provide the requisite credentials used by individuals who have successfully cleared Security Threat Assessment (STA) to gain unescorted access to special, sterile, and/or secured areas Offer screening services to support eligibility for unescorted access to special, sterile, and/or secured areas where credentials may not be provided or required Provide the means to vet (checks daily) more than 40 million individuals against the consolidated federal watch list Engage a wide range of transportation stakeholders requiring secure credentials to address current and emerging threats to the transportation industry Perform end-to-end program management for aviation, maritime, surface programs, and other future populations with core capabilities in enrollment services, vetting operations, adjudication, and credential management

These TIM Program capabilities will provide a unified, modular and maintainable architecture that will reduce the cost, risk, and time associated with implementing new capabilities and on-boarding of new populations, improve the robust nature of the architecture, meet mission generated surge and processing capabilities, and improve on-going operations and maintenance. In this effort, TTAC will consolidate the management of all vetting and credentialing programs within TSA, including but not limited to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Hazardous Material Endorsement Threat Assessment Program (HTAP), including the HME Screening gateway (SG) System. Transportation Worker Identification Credential Program (TWIC) Aviation Programs including: Aviation Worker (AW) Population Indirect Air Carrier (IAC) Population General Aviation (GA) Population Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP) International Crew Vetting Program (CVP) Colorado Springs Operation Center (CSOC) Vetting; and, Consolidated Screening Gateway (CSG) System.

Changes to the nation's threat environment and vulnerabilities in the transportation sector, as well as other critical infrastructures, drive how TTAC performs security threat assessments (STA) and requires TTAC to support new population requirements in a manner that is transparent, rapid, and extremely adaptable to unique population requirements. TIM's operating model must be flexible enough to handle these emergency surge requirements in an expeditious manner that does not adversely impact the transportation industry or traveling public.

8

A key operational performance goal of the TIM Program is to improve and to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of the transportation security threat assessments. In order to do this, TTAC will provide capabilities to meet the mission of the TIM program including: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ The consolidation and integration of the TTAC in-scope programs and services Provide an "enroll once, use many" environment Standardize vetting processes associated with like uses and like risks Standardize Customer Service Consider and incorporate the appropriate reuse of enterprise services and standards across screening and credentialing programs Provide enhanced technical architecture Accommodate future growth in demand for enrollment, vetting, and credentialing services Maximize the use of best practices, standards, and proven solutions Migrate the new TIM system into the two DHS Data Centers (DC1 located in Stennis, MS and DC2 located in Clarksville, VA) per the DHS mandate

3.0 Management 3.1 Objective The TIM ILSP describes the management approach for obtaining a highly supportable capability with an affordable and effective support structure. This document will describe the management approach, schedule, and funding requirements for integrating supportability requirements into the TIM system engineering process. The system engineering process focuses on designing the system for support and for developing/obtaining an integrated system support package (e.g. spares, support equipment, technical manuals, etc). 3.2 TIM Supportability and Sustainment Goals In order to contribute to the achievement of the stated DHS goals and objectives, the system must address and eliminate redundant business practices, processes, and subsequent IT investments to achieve significant economies of scale while providing the benefits of a uniform, integrated credentialing and threat assessment structure capable of meeting future demand. Program metrics must measure progress towards achieving these program objectives. The system performance parameters include: Enroll Once ­ Use Many: A critical requirement of the program is to strive towards a person centric system that recognizes workers who may apply for multiple credentials, endorsement, or Security Threat Assessments (STA) to work in multiple transportation or commercial modes. This allows for the capability to use enrollment information once for multiple enrollments. By recognizing that a STA has been already completed the system will not charge the worker for the full STA service again. This comparability capability enhances the ability of TTAC to fully integrate enrollment information across all programs, transportation modes, and commercial entities and saves users time and money Security Threat Assessment Response Time: The processing time for the STA process, although dependent on other Agencies, has a significant impact on stakeholders and customers. The STA process uses the biometric and biographic information to conduct an immigration check with the USCIS SAVE system, a criminal history check and finger print check with the FBI Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS), and a terrorist watch list check with the vetting system located at the TTAC Colorado Springs Operations Center (CSOC). The approved STA is required for the worker to start/continue work or to apply for a job. Any significant delays in the STA process will impact the worker and may impact commerce. The STA processing time will become more critical as serviced populations continue to grow. Operational Availability: The operational availability of the systems, as does the STA process, has a significant impact on stakeholders and customers. The system redundancy, elimination of single points of failure, and redundant production facilities are critical in maintaining a level of operational availability that does not impact the worker or impact commerce within the maritime, surface, aviation, or other industries. Ensure Security and Privacy: Critical to the program is the management and full compliance to system security and handling of privacy information. As such the program will strive to meet all security and privacy requirements with no significant reported incidents. The critical performance parameters, and their minimum performance thresholds and objectives are summarized in Table 1 below.

3.3 TIM Management Organization The TIM Program Manager oversees the TIM Program Management Office (PMO), which consists of representatives that directly report to the program manager, and representatives assigned to other organizations within DHS. The TIM Program Manager organizes the PMO to ensure development, testing, deployment, operation, safety, and life cycle supportability and sustainment are adequately addressed for during the TIM acquisition process. The TIM Program office will work through the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) to ensure that contractual requirements, SLAs, and deliverables are being met. Technical monitors (ILS Manager) will provide monitoring and input to the COTR in order to provide granularity in the measurement of the contractors performance. Additionally there will be project management reviews with the contractor that will include ILSP related updates. The organization relationship between the TIM Program Manager and the various PMO member offices is shown in Figure A2. Figure A-3 provides the overview of the ILS manager and the supporting components. The Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) Manager (see Figure A-3) is a matrix member of the TIM PMO. The ILS manager is responsible for the development of all supportability and sustainment activities, and for the update of the TIM ILSP to reflect these activities. Additionally, the TIM LCS Manger is responsible for managing not only the life cycle support and sustainment of the TIM system, but also for configuration management (CM), property management, and disposal of all system equipment. The ILS manager initiates logistics planning early in the acquisition life cycle, working closely with the TIM PMO to ensure system equipment acquisition contracts include the required supportability requirements. In addition to this role, the ILS manager also works with subject matter experts such as the TIM Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) and Office of Security Operations (OSO) in planning and implementing specific sustainment and supportability elements. Logistic support will be provided by the contractor with government oversight in accordance with the contractual SLAs and deliverables coordinated through the COTR. The supportability and sustainment function also evaluates reported performance data to determine root causes and corrective actions for reported issues with the TIM system equipment.

SECTION B. SUPPORTABILITY AND SUSTAINMENT PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT 1.0 Design for Supportability Both the system design and the logistics support strategy contribute to the achievement of Ao. The design must be sufficiently reliable and maintainable so that operational availability can be attained when failures occur and the logistics support system response. Likewise, the number and availability of logistics resources must be sufficient to enable repairs to be accomplished in timeframes that support availability requirements. Supportability design influence is achieved through the Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) requirements imposed in equipment specifications. Support system effectiveness is achieved through performance requirements in Contractor Logistic Support (CLS) contracts. Values for RAM specification requirements and CLS performance requirements are established to meet the overall Ao requirement. The logistics support section of the contract will impose performance requirements to drive logistics support system effectiveness. These are captured in the TIM system Key Performance Parameters (KPPs). Technical and operational testing, as explained in the TIM Test Engineering Management Plan (TEMP), are used to verify compliance with RAM design requirements. RAM operational data is also collected during Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) and throughout the system engineering life cycle to identify systems and subsystems that are degrading overall operational performance. As necessary, the ILS manager collaborates with TIM Engineering and product COTRs to implement targeted improvements to TIM system equipment. Further program substance will be developed as the AoA matures. For instance, there is currently no decision as to the service level TIM will choose within DC1 and DC2. This will impact how the ILSP manager and the contractor will interact with the systems engineering group as it relates to supporting the hardware.

1.1 RAM Measures The following terminology and definitions will be used as the basis for the TIM RAM Strategy. 1. Reliability: The ability of a system to perform its mission without failure, degradation, or demand on the support system. Reliability is a measure of the degree to which a system can complete it primary mission over a given duration. 2. Availability: A measure of the probability that a system will be in an operable state and can be committed at the start of a mission when the mission is called for at an unknown (random) point in time. 3. Maintainability: The ability of a system to be retained in, or restored to a specified condition when maintenance is performed by personnel having the specified skill levels, using prescribed procedures and resources, at each prescribed level of maintenance and repair. Maintainability is a characteristic of design and installation, expressed as a measure of the degree to which a system will be retained in or restored to a specified condition within a given period of time, when the maintenance is performed in accordance with prescribed procedures and resources. 4. Inherent Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) Value: Any measure of reliability, maintainability or availability that includes only the effects of item design and installation, and assumes an ideal operating and support environment. 5. Operational Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) Value: Any measure of RAM that includes the combined effects of item design, quality, installation, environment, operation, maintenance, and repair.

15

To support the acquisition and operations and maintenance phases, the TSA RAM Strategy uses the following primary terms/metrics for the development, testing, and operation of each TSA security equipment technology: TABLE B-2 RAM MEASURES Term/Metric Mean Time Between Critical Failure Reliability Mean Time Between Failure Mean Time Between Maintenance Mean Time To Repair Maintainability Mean Down Time Inherent Availability Availability Operational Availability Ao MDT Ai Acronym MTBCF MTBF MTBM MTTR

The specific reliability, maintainability, and availability measures applied will depend on the stage of the System Engineering Life Cycle (SELC) and whether an inherent or operational value is more appropriate.

1.2 Standard RAM Definitions The table below explains the standard definitions that will be used for each RAM metric and its application during a system's design/development, testing, and operations and maintenance phase. TABLE B-3 RAM DEFINITIONS Metric Reliability Definition For a particular interval, the total uptime1 of a security equipment technology divided by the total number of failures2 within the population requiring corrective maintenance actions to correct a critical failure3.

A measure of reliability that represents the average time between all maintenance actions both corrective maintenance4 and Level 2 preventive maintenance5 conducted on a security equipment technology. The total elapsed time (clock hours) to repair a security equipment technology divided by the total number of corrective maintenance actions during a given period of time. It does not include other delay times such as field technician response time, lead time for parts not readily available, or other administrative or logistics downtimes. Total operational time/hours6 that security equipment is not in a condition to perform its required mission (Downtime)7 divided by the total number of failures. It includes all the time it is not able to perform its mission including field technician response time, lead time for parts not readily available, or other administrative or logistics downtimes.

3. Critical Failure ­ A failure that causes the system to be non-operational and requires action by the maintenance service provider to restore the system to operation. 4. Corrective Maintenance ­ An action performed by a trained maintenance technician to restore a system to a specified condition. 5. Level 2 PM ­ These activities are performed by trained Contractor technicians and are performed routinely on a set time schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly). 6. Operational Hours/Time ­ This system will be operational 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. 7. Downtime ­ The period of time during which a system is not in a condition to perform its required mission during operational hours. This includes all times that a system is not available due to corrective, preventive, or depot maintenance. Downtime includes the total response and repair time of Contractor technicians. 8. Mean Logistics Delay Time - Mean Logistics Delay Time (MLDT): The average administrative and logistics delay time, includes delay time for spares, support equipment, personnel, facilities, transportation, and administrative activities.

1.3 RAM Formulas Based on the standard definitions for each RAM metric, TSA will use the formulas shown below for RAM measures during the development, testing, and operation of TSA security equipment: TABLE B-4 RAM FORMULAS Metric MTBCF MTBF MTBM MTTR Maintainability Availability MDT Ai Ao Formula MTBCF = Total Uptime/Number of Critical Failures MTBF = Total Uptime/Total Number of Failures MTBM = Total Uptime/Number of Corrective and Level 2 Preventive Maintenance Actions MTTR = Total Corrective Maintenance Time/Total Number of Failures MDT = Total Downtime/Total Number of Failures Ai = MTBF/(MTBF + MTTR) Ao = Uptime/Total Operational Time

Reliability

1.4 RAM Metrics for Program KPPs The Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) formally documents the critical cost, schedule, and performance parameters, which are expressed in measureable, quantitative terms that must be met in order to accomplish program goals. The APB parameters trace back to the mission gaps expressed in the MNS, and the requirements established in the ORD. Those parameters that are considered essential requirements of a system are referred to as Key Performance Parameters (KPP). 1.4.1 RAM Metric Objectives and Thresholds The APB, as well as other acquisition documents, delineates the program baseline parameters and their associated threshold and objective values as defined below:  Threshold - the minimum acceptable value that, in the user's judgment, is necessary to satisfy the need.  Objective ­ the value desired by the user for which the PM is contracting or otherwise attempting to obtain. The objective value could represent an operationally meaningful, time-critical, or cost-effective increment above the threshold. 1.4.2 Reliability Reliability is the probability of completion of the mission calculated for a rolling one-year period. In the operational environment, the TSA uses the MTBCF. The TSA considers a critical failure as a failure which prevents the system from

18

performing its intended function and cannot be cleared by operator intervention alone; the fault requires a call to maintenance. The system will be designed to meet a minimum of 1,468 hours MTBCF in an intended operational environment [values of 97% (t) and 99.99 (o)]. This is calculated assuming a 24-hour duty day. Rationale: The system needs to be reliable to justify the use of the equipment as a primary credentialing device. This means at a minimum the system cannot go down more than once every 4 months. The value is calculated off of a 24-hour duty day as this is the most common duty day for the credential sites. 1.4.3 Availability Among the RAM measures, the user community considers system availability (Ao) to be most important. Ao is the percentage of time, over a period during operational hours, that a system is available to perform its required mission. It reflects all potential causes of downtime, such as administrative downtime, logistic downtime, etc, and total operational uptime of the system. Rationale: The TSA requires a high degree of equipment availability for system operation. The value is calculated off of a 24-hour duty day as this is the most common duty day for system operation.

99%

Calculated by computing the system uptime divided by the total uptime, + downtime of the system.

1.4.4 Maintainability Maintainability is important in system design since the down time associated with maintenance determines the level of system availability. For determining the Maintainability of system for calculating Ao in the operational environment, the TSA considers the total operational time that a TSE is not in a condition to perform its required mission. This includes the time from the initial notification of the critical failure until the time the system is ready for acceptance and signoff by the TSA. MDT is calculated by dividing the total operating time that a system is not in a condition to perform its required mission by the number of failures over a given period. The design MTTR of the TSE is the actual corrective maintenance time to repair the TSE. This includes only the time from when the technician is ready to start the repair (parts and tools in place) to when the repaired TSE is ready for acceptance and signoff by the TSA. Where: Total Active Corrective Maintenance Time = Duration of Corrective Maintenance adjusted for airport operating hours. The time in which an airport is shutdown and maintenance cannot be conducted will not be counted as repair time.

19

Rationale: The system needs to be able to be repaired in a sufficient amount of time to meet the reliability and availability requirements in order to justify the use of the equipment as a primary passenger screening device. The MDT will be managed through a maintenance contract to ensure the MDT does not go above an acceptable operational limit. 2.0 Sustainment Concept The Test Manager is responsible for receiving and hosting the systems during on-site test and evaluation, and conducting an OT&E in accordance with the TEMP. After a successful OT&E, the TIM PMO will continue operational and support responsibilities for the life of the systems and decommissioning of existing legacy systems. Agreements for particular support by additional staff elements to provide areas of life cycle support will be implemented where practical and efficiencies are to be gained. The TIM Program will be sustained through the Design and Development Contract (the Contractor) under a contract vehicle that has yet to be determined. The contractor will be responsible for the operations, maintenance, monitoring, repair, upgrade/refresh of OT&E and mission-specific infrastructures at DC1, DC2, Annapolis Junction Operations Center (AJOC), as well as Test & Development locations. A portion of the Design and Development contract will be logistics that will cover the operation and maintenance support to include the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of OT&E and mission-specific infrastructure hardware and peripheral components O&M of OT&E and mission-specific infrastructure, operating systems and operating systems management tool components Configuration Data Manager for Software and Hardware Hardware and Software maintenance Supply support to include all supplies and spares Services to upgrade/refresh hardware and software

Depending upon the final Analysis of Alternatives, the logistics portion of the contract may cover, on a per unit cost basis, all preventive and corrective maintenance actions, the maintenance and technical workforce, training, repair parts support, maintenance manuals, support and test equipment, and repair parts packaging and shipment. When abnormal discrepancies outside the scope of the contract arise, the TSA Contracting Officer (CO) will separately authorize the Maintenance Service Provider (MSP) to perform the necessary corrective maintenance. TSA does not provide organic maintenance or logistics support, nor impose a particular support structure on maintenance service providers. Instead, MSPs are free to propose an effective and efficient management and maintenance structure that best meets the required performance standards identified in the Request for Proposal and the statement of work that will ultimately contain logistics support. The MSPs conduct cost and trade off analyses to determine the optimal quantities, location and transportation capabilities for manpower, repair parts, support equipment, and other support elements required to meet the service level agreements in the contracts. TSA life cycle support and acquisition personnel perform technical and price evaluation of all proposals in order to evaluate the merits of the technical approach, the management approach, past performance, the proposed price, and to identify/address any potential risks associated with the proposed approach. The technical evaluation determines the degree to which the proposal demonstrates clear understanding, knowledge, and experience in performance of the technical Integrated Logistics Support requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW), and the degree to which the proposal is logical, feasible, and technically effective. Evaluation of the management approach includes the areas of program management, program control, transition planning, management organization, subcontract management, risk management, requirements and traceability, quality assurance, continuity of operations, and security.

20

2.1 Configuration Management Configuration management is important to ensure that subsequent system changes do not affect the capability of the system. As such, TSA establishes and maintains a configuration baseline for system equipment. A baseline is a description of system attributes at a point in time that provides a known configuration to which changes are addressed. An initial product baseline may only be changed with approval of the TIM Change Control Board (CCB). The CCB is a board of technical and administrative representatives from within TTAC who recommend approval or disapproval of proposed changes to currently approved configuration documentation. The CCB is chaired by the Program Manager working within the TIM Lifecycle Support, and MSP representatives are invited to attend the CCB meetings.

4.0 Contracting for Supportability and Sustainment The TIM Program will follow the guidance and direction of DHS Directive 102-01 and Instruction/Guidebook 102-01001, which provides a framework via an Acquisition Life Cycle Framework, Acquisition review process, and Acquisition Review Board, and the Systems Engineering Life Cycle. The TIM Program schedule baseline will reflect the appropriate major program milestones consistent with DHS/TSA directives and guidance. The TIM Program is embarking on the next major phase of program activity, the selection of a Design and Development Contractor to design, build, test, deploy, manage, operate, and maintain transformed business processes and services. Currently the TIM program is awaiting the findings of an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) that is being conducted by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center. From the AoA, the TIM Program Office in consultation with TSA's Office of Acquisition will determine the best alternative and will then determine the best contract vehicle to procure that best alternative. 5.0 Retirement and Disposal TIM system equipment will be replaced throughout the lifecycle as needed based on a 33% annual technical refresh target. Occasionally, equipment will be targeted for replacement under the following circumstances: ˇ ˇ ˇ The equipment does not meet RAM standards The equipment is obsolete in performance characteristics that cannot be cost-effectively upgraded to meet the current standard of capability The equipment has reached the end of its useful life

The system equipment may also be replaced in advance of the end of its useful life (technical refresh). When funding is available, it may be prudent to spread out the recapitalization, replacing one-third of the hardware every year, rather than schedule numerous replacements in a short period of time. This phasing will allow a smoother transition and minimize the chance of delayed funding of other high priority projects due to critical needs for equipment replacement. In accordance with TSA property management policy, retired equipment may be screened for internal agency needs, external needs at other Federal or state agencies, or the general public. Equipment may also be destroyed. The TSA Disposition Process and Procedures Documents describe the process from the initial decommissioning notice to the final removal of property from official government property records. All disposal activities are conducted from the TSA Logistics Center warehouse in Grapevine, Texas. The Government Property Manager (GPM) will arrange for the proper reclamation and disposal of TSA equipment. The GPM ensures the TSA equipment is disposed of in compliance with policy dealing with Sensitive Security Information (SSI), safety, and hazardous material. Security is of paramount concern to TSA when disposing of equipment. Software programs and algorithms used in the software are of particular concern. To protect these, all computer storage devices are sanitized or destroyed prior to disposal to protect sensitive data.

23

SECTION C. SUPPORTABILITY ELEMENTS 1.0 Maintenance Planning The TIM maintenance concept is to contract for performance for preventive and corrective maintenance on all new and legacy TSA equipment under system support contracts. Both hardware and software maintenance response times will be outlined per the SLAs written in the contract. New procurements for equipment include warranties that cover preventive and corrective maintenance for a minimum of 12 months following successful Pilot Production Deployment. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are responsible for maintenance during the warranty period, and all maintenance actions will be recorded. Warranty maintenance records, as well as historical maintenance and cost experience for similar equipment, will be used by the ILS Manager and Contracting Officer to negotiate unit prices on system support contracts. 1.1 Hardware Maintenance 1.1.1 Warranty Information For TIM hardware failures under warranty, technicians will notify the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and provide to the OEM representative with the failed item nomenclature, equipment model, and serial number. The OEM shall repair or replace failed equipment under the conditions of the warranty. Non-warrant items will be handled by TIM PMO under the general rules, standards, and procedures as agreed upon in the contract. 1.1.2 Off-Site Hardware Maintenance Off-site maintenance for TIM shall be performed at the DHS Data Centers using subcontract resources or by the hardware manufacture(s) as outlined in the contract. 1.1.3 Repair/Return Procedures before IOC The TIM Logistics Manager shall handle all repair processes and items internally or through the subcontractor charged with building the system. 1.1.4 Repairs/Return Procedures The TIM Logistics Manager shall handle all repair processes and items internally using subcontract resources. The contractor is responsible for all repairs & returns including shipping and handling charges. The Contractor will be held responsible for meeting SLA's for uptime and availability. 1.1.5 Spares Concept The TIM PMO hardware vendors are responsible for acquiring parts and installing them on the systems. The contractor coordinates with the appropriate suppliers as necessary to obtain any/all materials necessary to support TIM system hardware. The Government will not own any spare parts. Maintenance contracts will be established with both hardware and software vendors for all products through the contractor on behalf of the government. These contracts will specify the SLA requirements as necessary for meeting the system requirements. They will be monitored and measured through the SLAs defined in the contract. 1.1.6 Site Spares The TIM PMO organization is local to the system and relies on local vendor maintenance agreements for vendors to supply required spares when failures occur. The PMO will provide space in order for stock vendor owned spares at data center sites for maintenance as outlined in the SLAs or maintenance agreements.

24

1.1.7 Maintenance Test and Support Equipment On behalf of the government, the contractor will establish maintenance contracts with both hardware and software vendors for all products. These contracts will specify the SLA requirements as necessary for meeting the system requirements. The contractor will be managed either through government monitors and/or through the COTR and CO. 1.1.8 OEM/Vendor Support Some vendor support is provided through the contractor on behalf of the government via contracts with the TIM PMO. The performance of the help desk will be monitored and performance metrics will be compared to the contractual Help Desk SLAs. 1.2 Software Maintenance 1.2.1 Software Support and Maintenance Maintenance planning begins early in the acquisition process with development of the maintenance concept. It will be conducted to achieve maintainability goals and establish requirements and tasks to be accomplished for achieving, restoring, and maintaining the operational capability for the life of the system. Maintenance planning consists of the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Overall maintenance plan Schedule, activities, and resources Backup plan procedures Recovery plan procedures Software maintenance

The contractor will provide maintenance plans based on the hardware and software vendors recommendations, as well as what is required in order to meet the contractual KPPs and SLAs. The purpose of these plans is to provide maintenance personnel with the information necessary to maintain the system effectively. The plans provide explanations on the software support environment, the roles and responsibilities of maintenance personnel, and the regular activities essential to the support and maintenance of program modules, job streams, and database structures. In addition, the documents discuss the processes and procedures for applying software and/or firmware patches to the system. The tasks that will be identified in the documents apply primarily to system administrators, network administrators, information systems auditors, and other information technology staff. The contractor will maintain the infrastructure in an up-to-date, "live", non-production state in direct support of Mission Applications in the DHS Data Centers. Support includes operations and maintenance of mission-specific infrastructure hardware and peripheral components, and mission-specific infrastructure, operating systems and operating systems management tool components. The infrastructure support also maintains and reviews the results of daily System Administration logs of all system administration work products and related services. All TTAC Infrastructure assets will be covered under maintenance agreements. TTAC does not maintain a critical and non-critical spares inventory. All supplies will be maintained and controlled by the maintenance agreements. 1.2.2 Software Support Concept Software Life Cycle Support for the TIM systems is the responsibility of the contractor who will provide the maintenance and service contracts with vendors on behalf of the government. The maintenance schedule will be managed TIM PMO.

25

The TIM PMO will also assist in system diagnostics, and in the confirmation of software problems. The operational systems installed software baselines shall only be made with the knowledge and concurrence of the TIM Change Control Board (CCB). 1.2.3 On-Site Software Maintenance On-site software maintenance is provided by the Contractor Software Development Teams. 1.2.4 Off-Site Software Maintenance Off-site software maintenance is provided remotely from the contractor by the respective system Software Development Teams. The contractor will provide maintenance per the SLAs outlined in the contract. 1.2.5 Software Technical Assistance Software technical assistance is provided remotely by the TIM Help Desk. Level 2 and 3 technical problems that cannot be resolved by the Help Desk Team will be provided to the Software Development Team for resolution. 1.2.6 Software Conventions and Standards The TIM PMO complies with all necessary TSA Conventions and Standards 1.2.7 Maintenance Changes TIM PMO Software Development Teams perform maintenance changes as required using software diagnostics. Similarly, TIM vendors use their own diagnostic methods to maintain their computer software. 1.2.8 Software Problem Reporting The TIM PMO will maintain configuration control of TIM software, which includes the source code executable files, and COTS products. The TIM configuration management tool will be provided by the contractor. Capabilities for the management tool will include at a minimum the following information: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ System or Program name Version number Release Date Nature of the Problem Actions taken to date Results of the actions taken Proposed course of future action (work-around or permanent fix) Any previous coordination of the problem.

1.3 Maintenance Types 1.3.1 Preventive Maintenance Preventive maintenance will be routinely and systematically scheduled for the purpose of preventing and predicting equipment and system failures that will diminish the operation and safety of the equipment. Maintenance of this type is defined in the Maintenance Plans. It provides administrative personnel with the information needed to perform the preventive maintenance requirements. The system administrators will be responsible for the scheduling and for

26

performing the required maintenance in order to both maintain our 24/7 operations as well as meet the Availability (Ao) KPP. 1.3.2 Facility Maintenance The facilities for the Data, Development, Test, and COOP will be located at the Information Technology Services Office (ITSO) Centers known as Data Center 1 and 2 (or DC1 and DC2). Services will be provided by either CSC for DC1 or HP for DC2. Facility maintenance will be routinely and systematically scheduled for the purpose of maintaining the integrity of installed building related systems and equipment environments, which preserves optimum performance. On a continuing basis, the maintenance staff handles maintenance issues as they occur and perform routine preventative maintenance. This service is provided on a fixed price per square foot for raised floor space. The cost will provide built out data center space to include finished raised floor, heating, ventilation, & air conditioning, cabling, racks, wiring, security, critical infrastructure maintenance, facility maintenance, and janitorial services. 1.3.3 Corrective Maintenance The facilities for the Data, Development, Test, and COOP will be located at the Information Technology Services Office Centers known as DC1 and DC2. Services will be provided by either CSC for DC1 or HP for DC2. Corrective maintenance repairs and restores failures to equipment, systems, and structure. Corrective maintenance will be performed whenever the system fails to meet predefined SLAs, KPPs, or exhibits sporadic events that require other fixes. The amount and severity of corrective maintenance required can be moderated by preventive maintenance in two ways proper functioning, software and/or firmware patching support and inspections, which tends to prevent failure and scheduled inspections, which allow detection of incipient failures. Routine corrective maintenance will be defined in the Maintenance Plans. The system administrators will be responsible for the scheduling and for performing the required maintenance. 2.0 Manpower Personnel and Training (MPT) 2.1 Purpose Personnel and training requirements must be established in terms of the number of people and skills necessary to operate and maintain the TIM systems. This section outlines the planning for immediate and out-year support personnel requirements. It also identifies the types of personnel skills and projected training needs to achieve the operational and maintenance levels in line with the maintenance concept. Personnel and training planning will incorporate, in so far as possible, the optimization of systems performance, the minimization of costs, and accommodation of requirements of the users of the systems. The TIM maintenance resource requirements are established by the TIM PMO and implemented through competitive support contracts. Support contracts specify maintenance positions, skill levels, and training that are required by the contractor to support the TIM hardware and software systems, as well as the operations, maintenance, support, and training needs for the systems. Training that is required to support the TIM systems is the responsibility of the principal Development and Integration Support contractor and will be fulfilled as requirements of the contract. Personnel and training requirements are established in terms of the number of people and skill necessary to operate and maintain the TIM system. The TIM PMO will sustain the existing system using current training processes.

27

The contractor will determine the mission-specific infrastructure workload requirements, including the O&M at other locations to encompass the work products and related services associated with maintaining the infrastructure in an up-todate, "live", non-production state, and the infrastructure in direct support of mission applications at the Annapolis Junction Operation Center (AJOC) location. The skill sets required will be specifically stated in the increments assigned to that Statement of Work (SOW), describing staffing. These increments are for operations, maintenance, monitoring, repair, upgrade, and update (O&M) of the TTAC OT&E and TIM Program mission-specific infrastructures at the DHS Data Centers, TTAC AJOC, and CSOC (Colorado Springs Operation Center) locations. They also establish O&M services for TTAC TIM Program systems that will migrate into the two DHS Data Centers for the purposes of continuance of operations (COOP), high availability, and/or backup sites. The core hour requirements required on a single 8-hour shift are from 8:00am to 4:30pm. However, key role O&M activities must be available on a 24/7 basis with additional on-call, on-site support available on a 24/7 capacity. Response times for all on-call support will be defined as required by each of the DHS Data Centers. The Contractor will also provide to the Government a list of recommended Key Personnel roles that will require 24/7 work at the AJOC facility as well as at the CSOC facility and provide the management and technical skill sets as defined in the SOW: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Project Manager System Administrators Asset Specialist Information/Physical Security OT&E System Administrator Systems Analyst Senior Network Engineer

Where possible and to the maximum extent possible, the contractor will consider "shared" resources to provide maximum benefit to the Government and to reduce labor and other costs. "Shared" resources are allocated based on the following priority: ˇ ˇ ˇ Resource-loaded schedule(s) providing level of effort and schedule for the TIM Program support requirements as provided by the COTR Production operations priorities and requirements Other O&M activities as defined in this SOW

All personnel will be subjected to, at a minimum, the EQIP process and receive a TSA suitability clearance in order to access SSI information. Additionally, there may be a requirement for the contractor to provide some personnel with the capacity to obtain a Secret Clearance. Trained qualified operators and certified engineers will be required to support and keep the equipment in service. Training reduces life costs and increases system efficiency, safety capability and availability. The TIM Program training will include overview material, security and privacy training, and other content as determined. Security training will provide a common understanding of the proper treatment and disposal of documentation, including Sensitive Security Information (SSI), and of other media as well as facility access procedures. Privacy training will provide guidance for the identification, protection, disclosure, and disposal of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

28

Role-based training will be developed to support the system support personnel through the development, testing, parallel operations, implementation, and maintenance of the TIM Program. Training will be delivered using a combination of the following methods: web-based, classroom-based, and on-the-job. A training program will be established to support the implementation, operation, and maintenance of the program. The TIM Program training classroom will be located at the AJOC facility. Training procedures will be developed to align with the program implementation schedule. Job aids, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and additional forms of training documentation will be provided to TIM Program support/program personnel, OSD and Service Center personnel, and other populations to support the individual component programs of TIM. The training content will be regularly evaluated, updated, and redistributed to the TIM Program employees as necessary. Training will be developed by the contractor. The contractor's training responsibilities are to include: ˇ Developing a training curriculum for both a Computer Based Training (CBT) application and classroom application as determined by the TIM Program Office requirements ˇ Conduct the training with knowledgeable, qualified instructors that hold necessary certifications when applicable ˇ Conduct or make available CBT training for users prior to the release of major systems, system upgrades, and/or changes ˇ Coordinate with the TIM Program office to determine the appropriate schedule to meet the implementation schedule 3.0 Product and Technical Data (PTD) 3.1 System Documentation The TIM PMO has or will develop the documents and engineering drawings. For the most part these documents can be accessed through the TIM Program Office. Associated COTS manuals and baseline documentation will be stored in a Technical Repository for Engineering Data/Acquisition Logistics support System. The system will be provided by DHS using the Sunflower and/or iShare application. The contactor will be provided access to the applications in order to load, maintain, and access the relevant system design information, hardware manuals and configurations, system architecture documents, wiring designs, and source code developed by the contractor. Upon termination of the contract, all information code within the systems will remain the property of the TIM Program Office. Additionally, all documents received will be in an electronic PDF or Microsoft Software product format, such as Visio or Word. These files will be available, initially through iShare and the WEB for validated users. The TIM PMO is responsible for ensuring the procurement and delivery of all data deliverables. The SMEs of the TIM Acquisition Logistics Integrated Product Team shall assist the TIM PMO in evaluating the acceptability of the vendor and developed deliverables. 4.0 Facilities/Infrastructure A critical program supporting the "One Infrastructure, One DHS" mission is Data Center Consolidations. The goal is to migrate data centers that reside in multiple, separate locations to two secure, geographically diverse Enterprise Data Centers (EDC): known as Data Center 1 (DC1) located in Mississippi and Data Center 2 (DC2) located in Virginia. DC1 is operated by Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) within the government-owned facility at NASA's Stennis Space Center. DC2 is contract-owned and operated by Hewlett Packard (HP). The Data Center Program entails developing and operating the EDC and facilitating Component migrations. The four major service capabilities that the EDC will provide are computing service, application services, disaster

29

recovery/continuity services, and data storage management. The TIM program is planning to host the bulk of its systems within these facilities. Other locations for major system components will include the Colorado Springs Operation Center (CSOC) as well as at the Annapolis Junction (AJOC) located in buildings 132 and 133. 5.0 Obsolescence Management The TIM program has two key initiatives that will impact obsolescence management. The first initiative depends on the outcome of the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) in identifying potential reuse opportunities with the current IT equipment. The second initiative is a strategy for replacing 25% to 33% of the core TIM IT system component portfolio every year in order to maintain a system that on any given year is less than two years old. This strategy enables the TIM system to remain current, expandable, and adaptable in an environment where technology obsolescence is less than 2 years. This strategy is also awaiting the outcome of the AoA.

SECTION D. SUSTAINMENT ELEMENTS 1.0 Supply Support This section is to be determined pending the outcomes of the Analysis of Alternatives. 2.0 Support Equipment This section is to be determined pending the outcomes of the Analysis of Alternatives. 3.0 Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) The TSA Office of Occupational Safety, Health and Environment (OSHE) is responsible for Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) policy and requirements, and for providing ESOH guidance to the TIM Program Manager. TSA OST Engineering and the TIM technology product COTR incorporate ESOH requirements into the TTAC TIM equipment specifications to ensure compliance with ESOH regulations. Environmental requirements cover heat, humidity, shock, and electromagnetic discharge compliance. Safety requirements cover exposure to heat, x-ray, and radiation emission, as well as electrical and ergonomic safety compliance. If hazardous materials are used, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) prepares and submits to TSA a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) to meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200, OSHA Hazard Communication. Occupational health requirements include human factors standards that govern the design of commercial systems. 4.0 Packaging, Handling, Storage and Transportation The TSA OST Property Manager, in conjunction with TIM technology product COTR, is responsible for specifying Packaging, Handling, Storage, and Transportation (PHS&T) requirements on TIM acquisitions and CLS MSP contracts. These contracts require the use of best commercial practices for packaging, handling, storage, and transportation of TIM equipment, spares, and repair parts. The OEM packages new equipment using guidance provided in ASTM-D-3951: Standard Practice for Commercial Packaging. Recognizing that some TIM equipment might be temporarily staged in the TSA Logistics Center warehouse prior to installation, equipment specifications require that systems be capable of storage under stated environmental conditions (heat, humidity, altitude) for not less than 12 months without special preparation or treatment, and without resulting in any permanent degradation of system performance or appearance. The product acquisition contract will require the OEM to provide the initial shipment from the factory to the TSA Logistics Center warehouse or TIM sites (DHS Data Centers, AJOC, or CSOC) as determined by the TIM PMO. TSA will be responsible for the cost of all subsequent shipments. The TIM program office allocated approximately $55,000 with the bulk of the cost occurring in the first 2 years for transporting systems for development, consolidation, and reuse purposes. Transportation cost for logistics and maintenance support of TIM equipment will be included under the contracts. The Government has a contract with FedEx delivery services. All shipping and tracking functions will be handled by FedEx through our Asset Manager. The FedEx customer service number is 1-800-GoFedEx (1-800-463-3339) and documentation and services can be found on: http://www.fedex.com/us/. 5.0 Information Technology Resources This section is to be determined pending the outcomes of the Analysis of Alternatives.

6.0 Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) TIM Systems are identified with the following information that is visible without disassembly of any hardware: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Manufacturer Name Model Unique Serial Number TSA Bar Code

This information must be provided to the TSRC (call center) when placing a maintenance service request. This information is entered into the Sunflower Asset Management System (SAMS), the official TSA property management database, for tracking and inventory purposes. The TSA Property Management IPT will assess the feasibility of using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) in the future. IPT members include OST Life Cycle Support, TSA Office of Property Management (OPM), and the TSA Office of Financial Management (OFM). 7.0 Deployment and Fielding The TIM Program's approach to deployment will be to ensure that testing and assessment will be comprehensive and provides a high level of confidence that deployment will be successful, while minimizing the economic and calendar impacts for both TSA and stakeholders. Specifically, the TIM Program's approach will build upon the following criteria: ˇ Use approaches, procedures, and results from previous testing to accelerate the testing required to ensure that the new systems are interacting properly. Previous testing includes: o Benchmark Testing, which used data from the programs o Parallel Testing, which will be conducted with legacy programs o Eliminate or reduce duplicative or low value testing whenever practical for legitimate reasons o Produce in both the program managers and the TIM Program leadership a high level of confidence that the program will be successful when cutover occurs with the legacy systems by: o Performing a readiness review in addition to technical testing o Executing a recommended 7-day of production acceptance testing and a cutover process with three interim checkpoints before reaching the point of actual cutover and application.

8.0 Post Production Support This section is to be determined pending the outcomes of the Analysis of Alternatives.

Executive Summary
The Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) is the planning document for all Test and Evaluation (T&E) related to the TTAC Infrastructure Modernization Program (TIM). Its primary purpose is to describe the necessary Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) and Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E). This document provides a "top-level" description of the program's T&E approach including the DT&E approach, a description of the program's test environment, schedules, organizations involved, and tests. Additionally, individual details for these tests are found in their respective test plan documents, which will be created by the Test Team(s). Each major test will have an associated evaluation report for TTAC leadership to use in support of decision making on the progress and execution of the program. The TEMP describes what needs to be conducted in order to determine system technical performance, operational effectiveness, operational suitability, and limitations. The TEMP will identify and test all critical and non-critical issues regarding the modernization program, and will provide solutions based on the outcomes. This TEMP includes major changes in program requirements, schedule and funding and as such the TEMP is a living document that will be reviewed and updated at each major Acquisition Decision Event (ADE). This TEMP is written concurrently and in some cases prior to initiation of the design documents (Operational Requirements Document, etc) yet to be developed. As these design documents are developed and approved this TEMP will be updated to reflect the content contained in all the developmental documentation. At this writing, some of the information is notional and may be modified or built upon as TIM is being designed and developed. This program will be implemented in a Component SELC (the four-phased approach as defined below) throughout the development life cycle:     Program Planning and Implementation Full system Development Transition TTAC Programs Operate/Steady State

Currently the program is developing requirements, building up staff, conducting an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), creating an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) and developing a preliminary TEMP. In addition to that, the development of system architecture will be ongoing, full system capability testing and evaluation will continue and the detailed design specifications will be completed. Development will proceed in an incremental approach, providing functionality to operations in a building block fashion until all the functionality has been delivered and is fully operational. The Transition phase is where all the functionality will be provided to operations and the legacy systems will be downgraded and eventually turned off. The Steady State/Operations phase is the point at which the development is complete, the legacy systems have been decommissioned and the production system is turned over to operations in a sustainment mode.

Test and Evaluation (T&E), as discussed throughout this document, will be accomplished with a phased approach starting with development and continuing through final delivery of the software to Full Operating Capability (FOC). The program has identified the following key test goals and objectives:  The system delivers the functionality as specified by the System Design Document and the requirements documentation (Business Requirements).  The software is high quality; it will replace/support the intended business functions and achieve the standards required for the development of new systems.  The program defines repeatable processes and procedures for testing.  TTAC ensures that operational partners participate in the test process and that their system and operational processes provide full support for the TTAC Infrastructure Modernization.  The program identifies test processes to integrate into TTAC's requirements traceability and feedback mechanism (validation and verification) for continual product improvement. Figure 1 below represents TTAC's basic approach to T&E for the Modernization Program. A more thorough chart is displayed in Section C.

Figure 1 - TTAC Test and Evaluation Approach Section A of this TEMP provides background information of the existing systems used for threat-assessment and credentialing and the improvements that will be realized. Operational effectiveness parameters, operational suitability parameters, and critical technical parameters are also defined in matrix form. The focus of Section A is T&E issues.

Section B provides the overall TIM program schedule at the program level, as well as a look at the IMS as it relates to T&E. Section B also describes the TIM test management, including all facets of DT&E, OT&E, and contractor support. This section also goes into roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in T&E. It includes TIM management, the TIM Developer Test Team (DTT), the System Development Team, configuration management, security, infrastructure management team, privacy, the communications team, and various review boards. Section C of this TEMP is responsible for outlining the Developmental Test & Evaluation portion of TIM. It includes the overview, DT&E to date, planned DT&E, and plans and reports. The TIM testers will conduct DT&E to demonstrate that the engineering design, integration, and development process is complete and meets the requirements. The DT&E approach is repeated for each of the development cycles (increments) identified within the TIM Master Objective & Threshold Schedule (see Figure B-1). DT&E starts with software development and Unit Testing of individual software components simultaneously. System Level Testing follows to verify the interoperability of the many subsystems, and to determine system compliance with standards and satisfaction of functional and technical requirements. During this phase, software performance, response time, and the system's ability to operate under stressed and high-load conditions will be tested. Security Test and Evaluation (STE) will be done concurrently with System Level Testing. This will test external system interfaces, high-availability, and privacy and security requirements. During System Acceptance Testing (SAT), every user feature is tested for correctness and satisfaction of functional requirements. System Acceptance Test evaluates user interfaces, all documentation, and the level to which the system meets user requirements. These tests will also ensure that response time, program run time, operator intervention requirements and reporting issues are acceptable. Section D of this TEMP is responsible for outlining the Operational Test & Evaluation portion of the TIM program. It includes an overview, Critical Operational Issues (COI's), OT&E to date, planned OT&E (including limitations), and plans and reports. The purpose of Operational Test & Evaluation (OT&E) is to confirm that TIM will deliver an operationally effective and suitable system prior to system deployment (go-live). Beginning with Interface testing and followed with an End-to-End test where TIM technology, processes, external interfaces, and the processes and systems of operational partners are tested. At the conclusion of this testing operational personnel will be brought in to assist in final testing of the system prior to installing the system live. TIM will also test the plans, processes, and procedures for the Continuity of Operations (COOP) during this phase of testing. During this period of testing the Office of Information of Technology (OIT) will act as the Operational Test Agent (OTA). Management by the OIT office will maintain independence required for this level of oversight by an OTA, in accordance with DHS Directive 026-06. The OTA will plan and conduct the operational testing during the Pilot Production Deployment (PPD). This testing by OTA will be independent of the development team after the Development Test Team initially sets-up the new TIM system in an operational environment. The testing by OTA will follow Operational Readiness Review (ORR), Authority To Operate (ATO), and Authority To Proceed (ATP) approval.

6

Section E of this TEMP includes the resource summary for T&E. The test resources that must be identified include test articles, sites, support equipment, threat systems, targets and expendables, operational program test support, simulations, administrative support, manpower, and investment requirements. The premise for building the test budget is based on acquiring the necessary expertise and resources. This planning includes the hardware, software and facilities costs as well as the teams for oversight and accreditation. The program will start building up test support teams and purchasing requisite hardware. Test engineers will be brought in to organize the pre-test products such as test plans and procedures.

Section A. Introduction
1. BACKGROUND The mission of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is to protect the nation's transportation systems to endure freedom of movement for people and commerce. To support this mission, the TSA Office of Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC) was established to conduct risk assessments and mitigation activities to prevent disruption to the nation's transportation system by terrorist or other national security threats. The TTAC Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) Program supports TSA's mission by significantly improving the vetting management and adjudication platform currently used for conducting security threat assessments (STA) on various transportation populations through the use of software applications and a common information technology infrastructure. The TIM program presents an opportunity to eliminate redundant business practices, processes, consolidate user databases and subsequent Information Technology (IT) investments to achieve significant economies of scale benefits associated with a unifying business integration effort. Business practices will be consolidated with the final development of this program. These practices will not be eliminated, but will remain intact only in the sense that the new TIM system will consolidate these practices into a onetime process. Currently, each enrollment business process need to be repeated each time an applicant requires more than one credential. This process will be consolidated such that the applicant will only have to update/add the requisite information. In doing this, the redundant processes will be eliminated. The system users are all internal to the program; however, there are external centers that require information from the system. The external centers are not considered to be users, but are recipients of the information that the users will provide. The internal system users are the Vetting Analysts and the Adjudicators. The Vetting Analysts attempt to match screened populations to various watch lists using their names and other Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The Adjudicators review cases that have been returned during the vetting process with a positive indication that there are peculiar circumstances and require further investigation. These cases will be reviewed to determine whether the individual is, or is not a threat. Investigation Referrals and Assessment (IR&A) analysts are also system users. IR&A investigates threats to transportation security that come from initial vetting of an individual or those threats that require continuous monitoring. They vet new populations as well as those individuals that have been labeled as a potential threat by the Veting analysts. The public is not considered a user because they are not accessing the system; however, if they are part of a specific screened population then they may provide their information to the system during the application process for a credential for the job that he/she needs it for. There are four (4) categories of programs that require information from the system users. These programs are Surface, Maritime, Aviation Worker and other programs. All these programs require their applicants to successfully pass a STA and in some instances be issued a credential before they can start work.

8

The primary purpose of this TEMP is to describe the strategy, which includes developmental testing, integration, and acceptance activities and operational testing. This TEMP delineates Operational testing requirements necessary for independent evaluation prior to obtaining approval to operate and eventually deploy the TIM product. All of the testing and oversight will culminate with the TIM development installed for operational use by the internal system users. To achieve this goal, the testing will include as a minimum the validation of the functionality for the programs listed below:    Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Commercial Driver's License Endorsement (HME) Aviation Programs o Aviation Workers Population (AW) o Indirect Air Carrier Population (IAC) o General Aviation Population (GA) o Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP) o International Crew Vetting Program (CVP)

TTAC currently uses four high-level legacy systems to perform threat-assessments and issue credentials. These systems were built one at a time on an as-needed basis and therefore, do not communicate well as an integrated system. The systems perform STA individually and also have different exclusion criteria. These legacy systems will be phased into an aggregated system that will be streamlined. The TIM system will be very different from the original stovepipe architecture. This will allow for tighter security and more efficient utilization of time and the ability to allow for an applicant to obtain multiple credentials at reduced costs. A new database will be built using a complex data translation layer. During this time all existing databases must remain up and 100% fully functional. Once the new database has been constructed the legacy data will be transitioned and the streamlining effort will be complete. Given that TIM will assume the overall functionality of enrollment, aggregation, vetting and adjudication currently performed through disparate legacy systems, TIM will execute additional and specific tests to verify the formerly standalone systems' processes, interfaces, and operational performance. Table C-1 of Section C of this TEMP delineates a list of tests that as a minimum will be considered for verifying the system functionality. At the completion of all this testing, the Development Test Team (DTT) and the Operational Test Agent (OTA) will submit their respective reports that will provide and assessment of the testing for each phase of the TIM development. These reports will be completed at the appropriate time according to the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) and presented to the Government for the Test Readiness and Operational Test Readiness Reviews. The current TTAC vetting and credentialing enterprise architecture, represented in Figure A-1 ­ TTAC As-Is Operating Environment was created to support 2.5 million individuals per year. Today, the populations supported by TTAC have almost quintuple, while operating resources have remained static. The TIM program's goals and objectives are aligned with the overall strategic plans of DHS and TSA namely, awareness and prevention. Due to the importance of

9

the program to DHS strategic plans, and the program's lifecycle cost (anticipated to be in the range of $567 Million over the next ten years), the TIM Program is an acquisition Level 2 project.

Figure A-1 - TTAC AS-Is Operating Environment The current system shown in Figure A-1 is built as a "Stove Pipe" concept. Each program is essentially a separate process that includes unnecessary duplication of services. Redundancy is currently required if an individual requires two or more program services because for each service the individual will reenter the system through a different program application without any reuse of his or her prior STA. Figure A-2a and A-2b below show a high level and a more detailed perspective of the new conceptual design configuration.

Figure A-2b - TIM To-Be Infrastructure Architecture Changes to the nation's threat environment and vulnerabilities in the transportation sector over time, drive how TTAC performs STA and requires TTAC to support new population requirements in a manner that is transparent, rapid, and extremely adaptable to unique population requirements. TIM's operating model must be flexible enough to handle these emergency

10

situations in an expeditious manner that does not adversely impact the transportation industry or traveling public. In order to achieve this mission and these goals, TIM devised the test approach outlined in this document to confirm that its systems and processes will be effective. The TIM program, under TSA's TTAC office, will conduct the test phases outlined in this document. The testing locations for the TIM development will be determined at a later time; however, the options that are being considered are either at Annapolis Junction, a contractor facility, other government facilities or a combination of all three. The IMS for this program contains additional information on the status and future plans for the TIM program and projected dates of Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E) and Operational Test & Evaluaiton (OT&E) tests.

Section B. Program Summary
1. INTEGRATED MASTER SCHEDULE TSA is using a phased approach to achieve its modernization objectives and mitigate implementation risks, while improving TTAC's program performance over a timeline that marks incremental development and deployment activities as its milestones. Key milestones represent significant events in the program. Management review of key milestones will ensure that an effective mechanism exists for tracking and reporting progress on the TTAC Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) program. Once the TIM Program schedule is finalized, changes to the baseline will require formal reviews and will be scrutinized by the program level Technical Review Board (TRB), Change Control Board (CCB) and Executive Review Board (ERB) as outlined in the TIM Change Management Plan (CMP). The program manager will monitor the changes to the schedule to determine if key milestones will remain on schedule. On a regular basis, department leads will provide updates on their respective schedules to the program manager, along with all status information. The program manager then analyzes the updates to determine the progress toward schedule completion and to compare the key milestones to the corresponding baseline dates in the schedule. The Program manager as the chair of the T&E WIPT will work with the WIPT members to keep the team updated as to the status of the program. The Test and Evaluation (T&E) Master Objective & Threshold Schedule on the following page (Figure B-1) presents a high level view of the TIM testing program. This T&E Master Objective & Threshold Schedule represents the planned testing milestones throughout the development and test life cycle of the TIM program. Included in the schedule are the planned incremental (phased) approach of the TIM development and a depiction of how test events provide information for required milestone decision/approval points to continue with the program. The T&E Master Objective & Threshold Schedule is primarily a schedule of the Obtain activities for testing. Each increment starts with a Test Readiness Review one (TRR1) and continues through all the requisite reviews ending with the Letter Of Acceptance (LOA) after the Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) activities. TIM will be developed in service oriented architecture, so core services can be provided in a standardized manor. It is anticipated that the order of development will be first Maritime, then Surface and finally Aviation. The T&E Master Objective & Threshold Schedule shown in the next section (Figure B-1) is a representation of how these three increments will be developed and deployed. Each increment is in place to Design, Test, Develop, and Implement its part of the TIM system.

19

Initial Operational Capability Date The Initial Operational Capability (IOC) will be achieved after the first of the three increments has gone through its Pilot Production Deployment (PPD). More information about PPD as it relates to operational testing can be found in Section D of this document. While each increment is developed and operationally tested, the corresponding legacy systems will still be operating. Notice, in Figure B-1 T&E Master Objective & Threshold Schedule that each increment overlaps the next by a period of time, making this a waterfall development paradigm. It is crucial to our National security that the legacy process is still functional as the TIM system is implemented. Full Operational Capability Date The target FOC date can be found in the TIM Master Objective & Threshold Schedule. Key decision gates and program milestone activities are shown that will drive the full delivery and implementation of the TIM Program. The delineation between agency governance and internal program level performance milestones are clearly noted. Full Operational Capability (FOC) is achieved when all three increments of TIM capability are fully deployed.

2. MANAGEMENT The TIM program is under the control of the Director Program Design and Development, the Program Executive Officer (PEO) and the TIM Program Manager (PM). Direct leadership for this program is provided by the PEO, PM and Deputy PM. Although the PM reports to the PEO, he is ultimately responsible for the program execution. In addition, separate test organizations are responsible for various elements including:  DHS Director of Operational Test & Evaluaiton (DOT&E) will provide test oversight for the Department. The DOT&E will approve the Operational Test Authority (OTA), the Operational Test Plan (OTP), and the TEMP, as well as produce a Letter of Assessment (LOA) in accordance with DHS Directive 026-06. Operational Test Authority (OTA) is the entity that performs the independent operational testing and produces the System Evaluation Report (SER) regarding TIM operational effectiveness and suitability. The OTA will be independent from the PMO and Developer Test Team (DTT). Prime Contractor is responsible for the system development and unit testing the development. During the development the Prime Contractor will test all the building





21

blocks (or units) as each unit of the development is completed. The Prime Contractor will form a Development Test Team (DTT). The DTT will be responsible for testing all aspects of the development including end-to-end tests.  T&E WIPT will provide test and evaluation counsel throughout the duration of the program in accordance with the applicable DHS and TSA instructions and the T&E WIPT Charter.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES Table B-1 below describes TTAC roles and responsibilities for the execution of T&E for the Modernization Program.

The Program Manager (PM) is responsible for coordinating the overall T&E program. The PM performs this task with the assistance of the Sponsor, Support organizations (including logistics and training), an independent operational Test and Evaluation Advisor (if required), and testing organizations. The PM is responsible for conducting DT&E. Assists the PM as required in all aspects of the program. The Deputy PM is also the Technical Lead for the program and system formulation, systems design and integration. He also technically coordinates developmental and operational tests of these mission capabilities. Test Management Oversight is provided by the WIPT, which establishes and serves as test oversight in matters to ensure that the program follows the requisite DHS and TSA requirements consistent with DHS 102-01. The Program Manager (PM) chairs the WIPT with the Test Manager as co-chair. The WIPT consists of representatives from each organization involved in the overall T&E effort, specifically DHS and TSA. The Test Manager manages the testing efforts of the test team provided by the Development Contractor. He coordinates the Independent test team activities and liaises to ensure that they receive DT&E test related documents. He also arranges for their use of the test system as necessary on a "not-to-interfere basis" with the ongoing DT&E testing and development. He is involved with the arrangement of the independent Operational testing events at the end of the development testing cycle. The more technical issues that do not relate to issues of performance, cost, and schedule are discussed at the Technical Review Board (TRB). The TRB is intended to formalize technical exchanges. It provides an open forum to discuss problems, enhancements to the architecture, future capabilities of the system, as well as provide a unified mechanism for sharing information. It minimizes the need for technical discussions at the Change Control Board (CCB) by providing recommendations after reaching a consensus in a standard format

Section C. Developmental Test and Evaluation
1. DEVELOPMENTAL TEST AND EVALUATION OVERVIEW TTAC conducts Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) to prepare for operational testing and to support the acquisition strategy, demonstrate that the engineering design, integration and development process is complete and to provide the information necessary for informed decision making throughout the developmental process at each critical decision point. DT&E minimizes developmental and deployment risks and supports the verification and validation of the systems engineering process and must provide confidence that the system design solution is on track to satisfy the desired capabilities for all software releases. Throughout the development three test teams will be engaged, with the first referred to as the Developer Test Team (DTT), the second as the Independent Validation and Verification Team (IV&V Team) and the third will be the Contractor Operational Test Agent (COTA). The DTT and all other development workers will be appointed by the same Prime contractor. The IV&V Team will be an independent test group and will be involved throughout the development life cycle of the system. The IV&V team will be responsible for learning the system, collecting Developmental Testing data that, when provided to COTA and combined with Operational Testing data, will be used to verify that all requirements, Critical Operating Issues (COIs), Measures of Performance (MOP), Measures of Effectiveness (MOE), Measures of Suitability (MOS) and Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) are met. The COTA will be responsible for conducting operational testing during the Pilot Production Deployment testing and will complete the System Evaluation Report (SER). They will be involved throughout the entire program development. To accomplish this and to minimize developmental risks, DT&E will be conducted in a four phase approach described below: DT&E four phased testing approach:

1. Unit Testing- This testing is accomplished by the Developers as part of the software development process. The primary focus of this phase of testing is to ensure that the newly developed software subsystems operate correctly and can be integrated with other subsystems as appropriate. This phase requires that the developer complete the requisite software code, a unit test report and a Version Description Document (VDD). As each unit or sub module of the code is completed and tested by the Developer it will then be further unit tested by the DTT. This test team will either be a team designated by the prime contractor or a sub to the prime development contractor. This testing may overlap with development and, at this time, there will be collaboration between the Developers and the DTT. The DTT is a separate group of dedicated testers that have the responsibility to do more detailed software testing on the individual software modules. After testing, each module is integrated into the system forming a larger and larger system.

25

The VDD is a critical document created by the Developers as each unit of software is completed and passed on to the DTT. The VDD will be used by the DTT to assist in understanding the operation of the newly created software and delineate which requirements the software satisfies. This document can be used by the testers to create their test plan and procedures. Testing in this phase includes testing of each of the subsystem modules and the system's performance as each part of the system is being developed and integrated with the other. 2. DT&E System Level Testing ­ This phase of testing is completed in the test environment by the DTT (mentioned above). The main question that this testing will answer is "does the system work as designed, i.e. meet requirements?" It will include the testing of the various parts of the development as a whole system, including testing all functions of the system. The DTT will develop the test procedures for each of the tests conducted during this phase. The test procedures will be approved by the Government Test Lead. The Prime contractor and the DTT will present a test plan document for government approval as an initial tasking after contract award and after forming the DTT. There are many types of tests that need to be created to thoroughly test the system. The focus of this phase of testing will be Requirements, Critical Technical Parameters (CTPs), Critical Operating Issues (COIs), Operational Readiness Doccument (ORD) requirements, preparing Development Test plans and procedures and developing the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM), which will trace test procedures to all requirements to the ORD to the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and finally to the Mission Needs Statement (MNS). The list below (Table C-1) represents a development level of testing. The Prime Contractor DT&E test plan will address at least all the types of testing shown in Table C-1.

Failure mode tests

Data conversion/Integrity Testing

Data migration Testing Data Back-up and restore Sustainability testing (Load/Volume/Stress testing)

Confirms the utility of the system and the system operational characteristics if some of the parts fail. It answers ­ Can the system continue to operate in a degraded mode. Testing to confirm that when data is converted from one format to another it is converted as expected and that the currency and status of converted data is the same prior to conversion. Testing to ensure that when data is migrated from one platform to another it is migrated as expected. Can stored data be backed up and then restored to the primary system. To confirm that the system can hold up under a heavy operational period. Test is typically conducted over a continuous three day period and requires an automated script

26

to assist in the testing. Tests that confirm that data can be deleted if necessary. Process to determine that an information system protects data and maintains functionality as intended. Failover testing Will the system switch over to an alternate system? Restoring to primary system Can the system be resored to its original state in the primary after Failover testing system after a failover test? End to End testing System testing that demonstrates that the system will not distort or corrupt signal/data from beginning to end. Interface testing Determines that the basic parts/modules of the system are communicating properly with corruption in signal flow. Verification of Performance To confirm that the system performed within a specified speed, Specifications Requirements data accuracy, latency, etc. Regression testing as necessary Testing to ensure all parts of the system are operating correctly. System Integration test Tests that confirm that the system will function properly as a whole system. Confirmation testing To confirm that the system is fully integrated. Usability testing To evaluate the system by using actual users as testers. Compatibility testing To confirm that all aspects are properly integrated. Scalability testing To confirm that the system being tested can be scaled-up. Table C-1-Development Testing 3. Security Test & Evaluation (ST&E) Testing ­ This phase of testing will be conducted after development testing is completed and it will be conducted on the test system that was used by the DTT. However, ST&E testing may be conducted during DTT for the purposes of the ST&E team learning the system and preparing for their final ST&E test leading to Certification and Accreditation (C&A). ST&E testing is early in the development cycle immediately after DTT testing to obtain the C&A early so the system can continue toward Operational Testing by the COTA. The Information System Security Officers (ISSOs) provide security governance and will oversee the developer to ensure security requirements are met and will coordinate with Office of Information Technology (OIT) security that validates and verifies the system during the Certification and Accreditation process leading up to Authority to Operate (ATO). The ISSO team will also test for security violations after the DTT has completed their testing and prior to System Acceptance Testing (SAT). This phase of their testing will be on the test system and will be without interference from either the Developer or DTT. The test system will be used for ST&E testing because the system is not ready for installation in an operational environment until just prior to Pilot Production Deployment (PPD) testing by COTA. ST&E and the C&A Data deletion if necessary Security testing

27

process will be conducted on a yearly or as needed basis and prior to ATO expirations by the TSA security team. 4. System Acceptance Test (SAT) ­ This phase of testing is conducted in the test environment on the test system and is intended to demonstrate that the system meets the user's needs. This testing is conducted by the DTT as a prelude to the PPD testing and will be conducted after all functional testing is completed. It is focused not only on functionality, but the operational testing that will eventually answer the question "Does the system meet the operational needs and requirements of the proposed development according to the Concept of Operations (CONOP)." This phase of testing represents a shift in testing philosophy in that the testing emphasis shifts toward testing the Measures of Performance (MOP), Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) Measures of Suitability (MOS) and Key Performance Parameters (KPP). This testing will be conducted with a small representative sample of system users and will be conducted in the test spaces on the test hardware that was used for all the functional testing. Successful completion of this testing will result in a move forward into the PPD testing on the live system. SAT completes testing by the DTT with the exception of any testing that may be needed to assist in correcting any non critical residual discrepancies found during Developmental Testing and any testing required for installing the system at field sites. Installation of the system at other sites will be required prior to PPD testing by the COTA test team. The system is at a point where the final phases of independent testing will be overseen by an Operational Test Authority (OTA). However, to mitigate risk after installing the system on the live system (i.e. operational environment), there will be transitional testing required by the DTT to verify that the newly developed system functions as designed on the operational system. The DTT will prepare a test plan and test procedures for the transitional testing. Transitional testing is done by the DTT prior to the COTA test team commencing PPD. This testing may consist of installation testing to verify system integrity and functionality, End-to-End testing, Operator interface tests and Continuity of Operations Tests as well as others deemed necessary by the DTT and government test manager. The purpose is to validate the installation of the software in the production environment in preparation for COTA testing. It is anticipated that this transitional testing will require approximately two weeks of rigorous testing. Problem Reporting- Throughout the testing process the testers may discover discrepancies of varying level of criticality. For each problem found during development or testing phase a Problem Report (PR) will be written to identify the problem and correction by the Development Team. These PR's will be kept in an appropriate repository (e.g. Clearquest, TRAC etc.) and assigned an appropriate level of criticality by the initiator. These PR's can be written by anyone familiar with the system; however, a PR can only be cleared by the DTT after their evaluation or testing (Regression Testing at a minimum) confirming that the problem has been fixed. Table C-2 below provides the basis of evaluating the criticality of PR's.

Table C-2 Problem Report (PR) Level Definitions The Prime Contractor will follow this TEMP and use its developmental processes and industry best practices throughout the development and test program. Any Government approved deviations from the TEMP must be documented in the DT&E test plan and will require the

29

TEMP to be updated. DT&E results and reports are evaluated by government personnel or their designated representatives and separately by the IV&V and COTA test teams to determine that the system meets specifications, to estimate the system's utility when it is introduced into the field and to mitigate program and system performance risk. Finally, TIM uses DT&E processes to confirm that the system performs as technically specified and that the system is ready for operational testing based on the system fulfilling the requirements and the KPPs. TIM's DT&E approach is repeated for each of the development cycles (capability releases) identified within the TIM Master Objective & Threshold Schedule as shown in Section B of this TEMP. Some of these DT&E steps are not applicable to the earlier capability releases, but all will be completed at the final release of the new TIM infrastructure. The approach includes multiple steps devised to:  Verify the design   Minimize risks Substantiate the achievement of technical performance

Figure C-1 below shows the test cycle process from Unit development testing by the DTT through final PPD testing by the COTA Test Team. Included in this Preliminary Test Milestone Schedule is the anticipated reporting and review points as well as the anticipated approval for continuing the development to full deployment.

Figure C-1. Test Cycle Process 2. DEVELOPMENTAL TEST AND EVALUATION TO DATE The TIM program is currently in the program planning phase. At this time contracts have been awarded for a team to complete an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). DT&E has not been conducted for the TTAC Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) Program to date. 3. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTAL TEST AND EVALUATION The difference between DT&E and testing by the COTA will be in the approach and style of testing. DT&E will be geared toward functional testing ensuring that the system operates in accordance with the design and that it meet the requirements and Critical Operational Issues (COI). For all other DT&E conducted for this program, the following outlines the test activities that are expected to be performed.

31



Section 508 Testing ­ 508 accessibility testing begins at the acquisition phase with Section 508 Compliance evaluation. The system will be evaluated by the DTT at each of the major milestones for compliance with the 508 requirements. Developer Unit Testing ­ This testing begins with the initial development of the software and is conducted by the individual developers during the software development. It is anticipated that the software will be developed as units meeting various requirements and then pieced together to form a larger system meeting the program capability requirements and KPP's. A Unit Test Plan, documented in the overall DT&E plan, will be created by the Prime Contractor with Government review and prior to passing the unit of software to the DTT. A Version Description Document (VDD), prepared by the developer, will accompany the software units for use by the DTT. o Configuration description ­ This development system is anticipated to provide the same information as the legacy system; however, the process of providing that information will change with this new design. The development system is described in Section B of this TEMP. o Objectives  Determine if the unit of software functions as anticipated.  Determine if the requirements as defined in the Functional Requirements Document (FRD) have been met.  Write the VDD for each testable module of software produced. o DT&E Events, Scope of Testing, and Basic Scenarios ­ Each developer when testing his/her software has its own scenarios to test the particular software module that it is developing. This testing is done by the developer and may be in conjunction with the members of the DTT overlapping with the next phase of testing ­ DT&E system testing. The test environment will be the development spaces using development machines during the initial software development. o Limitations ­ Unit testing is not full testing of a system. It is the modular testing of part of the entire system, which will eventually become part of an entire software system. As such this testing is limited in that end-to-end testing, load testing, performance testing and full integration testing cannot be done during this phase of the development. This testing is basically limited to functional testing of a module of software for the entire system.





DT&E Unit and System Level Testing ­ This testing is a continuation of Unit testing discussed above with this testing completed by a dedicated test team working in collaboration with the Developers. As the Developers complete various units of the design, they are forwarded to the DTT for testing functionality and operability of the software and requirements. This testing will begin to build the units into a system. Interface testing between each unit will also be done and evaluated for correctness, proper signals and operational functionality. After completing all software the DTT will have a system to test prior to the next phase of testing. Discrepancies found during this

32

phase of testing will result in documenting Problem Reports (PR) which will be recorded and tracked in an appropriate agreed upon repository. o Configuration description ­ The system used by the DTT is the primary test system for the software. It is anticipated that the test system will more closely resemble the final production system, but due to hardware and budget constraints may not be an exact configuration. The system will be capable of accommodating several testers and conducting different test scenarios simultaneously. o Objectives  Determine if the units of software functions as anticipated separately and when interfaced together.  Determine if the requirements as defined in the Functional Requirements Document (FRD) have been met for the system.  Prepare Test Plans, Scenarios and Reports.  Test the interface between units as the units are built into a system.  Test the completed system end-to-end.  Stress test the system.  Confirm that the system meets the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs).  Document all PR's and ensure that corrected PR's are properly tested and that the list of PR's are maintained.  Prepare a DT&E report.  Prepare appropriate information for Test Readiness Reviews (TRR).  Provide the appropriate test plans, procedures and other necessary documentation are completed for each phase of this testing.  Obtain Authority To Operate (ATO). o DT&E Events, Scope of Testing, and Basic Scenarios ­ DT&E testing is conducted at the development facility as determined by the government. This testing is done by the DTT initially working with the Developers to assist in developmental testing (for Tester familiarity). The DTT will write a Test Plan encompassing each part of the testing that they will complete (e.g. unit tests, integration tests, system tests, etc.). The DTT will also write Test Procedures that will show traceability to the requirements being tested. The environment for these tests is a hardware system that is as closely mirrored to the operational system as possible given the budget constraints at the time the system is built. The DTT will write test scenarios and test cases that will test the functionality against the requirements of the entire system and test the system from end-to-end. o Limitations ­ Since this testing is done on a test platform, the platform may have limitations due to capacity of the system, simulated real world databases, etc that will prevent realistic testing. Stress testing or multiple users using the system at the same time may not be as realistic as needed to fully prove system utility. Some scenarios may not be tested because of the need to use real world data that may not be available.

33



System Acceptance Test (SAT) ­ This testing will be completed by the DTT. This testing will be completed after the system has been functionally tested and it will focus on meeting the operational needs of the program. This testing will also focus on the system requirements and Critical Operating Issues (COI). This testing will be accomplished at a location determined by the government and will use the same test system that was previously used for DT&E Unit and System testing. Analysts will assist in the testing to exercise the system according to test scenarios that will be written by the DTT and with assistance from the analysts. These scenarios will be written with input from the operators to bring in real world test cases. o Configuration description ­ This is the first test end-to-end using a few Analysts with the perspective of the operator. This test will be done on the test system. o Objectives:  Test the system to determine that it meets the operational needs in accordance with the Concept of Operations.  Verify that the system meets the KPP's.  Assess that the system is ready to move forward into SAT testing on the live system.  Write Operational Test Scenarios and Test Cases that will test both Requirement and COI functionality.  Write the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM). o DT&E Events, Scope of Testing, and Basic Scenarios ­ This is an operation test that will test the system end-to-end from an operational perspective. Test scenarios will be used that will be written by the DTT with input and assistance from the Analysts. It is anticipated that several test scenarios will be developed as determined by the DTT and Analysts and approved by the Government. The testing will be on the test system simulating an operational system as much as possible. o Limitations ­ Testing is done on the test system not an operational system. This test will be conducted with only a small representative sample of users and thus the system will not be as stressed as it will be during operations. The system will only be using simulated test databases.



Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) ­ This testing will be completed primarily after the System Level Testing is completed by the DTT. The ST&E may be a government security test team. This team will also conduct cursory testing during System Level testing in collaboration with the DTT. After System Level testing the ST&E testing will be conducted without any other simultaneous testing. This team will write and submit for PMO approval a Security Assessment Test Plan prior to their testing. This testing will be provided to the Government prior to Test Readiness Review Two (TRR2) and the STE will present this plan at TRR2. o Configuration description ­ This testing will be conducted on the test platform.

34

o

Objectives    Ensure that the system is not vulnerable to Cyber attacks. Ensure that the system will provide the correct exclusion criteria. Other objectives as deemed necessary by the ISSO.

o DT&E Events, Scope of Testing, and Basic Scenarios ­ This is end-to-end testing. o Limitations ­ Testing is limited to current knowledge of methods of Cyber attacks.

Section D: Operational Test and Evaluation
1. OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUATION OVERVIEW The TTAC Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) Program is in the very early stages of development. At the writing of this TEMP, the design has not been established and the contract for the Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) was just awarded. There are other documents that are required for the complete development of the TEMP, which include Operational Requirements Document (ORD), and the Concept of Operations (CONOP). These documents are currently in draft form and when complete will require an update of this preliminary TEMP. Thus this section is being written without the assistance of an independent test team or the benefit of knowing any details of the design. It is anticipated that when the appropriate teams are brought into the program, this section will be updated at that time and will be required as a contract deliverable. Therefore, this section will describe the government's position and expectations of both Development Testing and Independent Testing. Typically a program of this nature will require final testing in the form of an Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) by an independent test team. However, this program will conclude its final test phase by initiating a Pilot Production Deployment (PPD) and it will be conducted by an independent contractor, which will be the Contractor Operational Test Agent (COTA) contractor team. The COTA team will be a separate contract team independent from the development test team and they will be deployed early in the development cycle. The COTA team will be a small test team that does not require production development knowledge; instead they will adopt the "Black Box" testing approach to test and understanding the functional specifications and requirements of the system. However, their approach will be to view the system as it will be viewed by the Analyst i.e. in an operational view point. The COTA will be contracted by Office of Information Technology (OIT) who will be the Government Operational Test Authority (OTA). The COTA will report directly to the Government Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR). This will maintain the needed independence from the program office and the COTA The COTA will be brought on early in the program, concurrent or shortly after the developer teams. During the early program period it is anticipated that the COTA will learn the intricacies of the program requirements, become familiar with the software and system functionality and begin developing their test plans and procedures for their testing during the final product testing (i.e. Pilot Produciton Deployment (PPD)) prior to release to operations. Ongoing negotiations with Office of Information Technology (OIT) are currently being conducted with preliminary approval of the concept for OIT stepping into the role of the OTA. With OIT filling the responsibilities of OTA, independence will be maintained between the program and the required OTA oversight. The System Evaluation Report (SER) will be written by the COTA at the completion of the PPD testing. The goal of the COTA is to bring an autonomous unbiased evaluation of the product. By not being involved with the development and disassociated from the Developer Test Team (DTT) and the Program Management Office (PMO) they will maintain independence for an unbiased

38

system evaluation. The COTA is not concerned with the fixing of the bugs, as found by the DTT, but will concentrate on the product from the User's perspective. It is anticipated that the COTA team will observe throughout all phases of testing during development and collect appropriate data to assist in their independent testing and test as necessary for their confirmation. However, early in the program development they will be learning the program and developing their plans and test procedures for the final test that will lead to full operations. The COTA will also attend test related meetings and provide feedback (via briefings and reports) and attend test related meetings during the development and various meeting and presentations in an effort to advise the PM on any deviation from requirements and program developmental plans. The primary purpose of conducting an Operational Testing evaluation is to determine if the TIM development is operationally effective and suitable for the operational environment that it is designed for. Thus, included in the assessment of the COTA will be an evaluation of both Operational Effectiveness and Operational Suitability as defined below: Operational effectiveness is the overall ability of the new system to provide an improved operational value when used by operators in the environment they conduct their duties. Effectiveness also considers the operators organizations doctrine, tactics supportability, survivability, etc. The degree to which the system can be placed and sustained adequately in field use is a measure of operational suitability. Suitability considers reliability, availability, maintainability, human factors, manpower, logistics supportability, field environment, training, and documentation requirements. With this in mind, Independent testing will begin with the approval to move the project forward on the live system following Operation Readiness Review (ORR3), Authority To Operate (ATO) and Authority To Proceed (ATP). This decision will be obtained at the Operational Test Readiness Review (OTRR), which will be conducted at the completion of the System Acceptance Test (SAT). Following SAT, an OTRR and Operational Readiness Review (ORR) meetings will be conducted by both the COTA and the OTA. During these meetings it is anticipated that the ATO and ATP will be obtained, thus allowing a move into PPD testing by the COTA. The successful conclusion of SAT testing marks the end of Development Testing and with the conclusion of all the milestone decision meetings marks the beginning of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) testing. The entry into the PPD phase will commence with the ATP. PPD is the culmination of the COTA's efforts. During PPD all their independent test plans, procedures and scenarios are put in action for the purpose of verifying that the operational effectiveness and suitability as defined above is delivered to the analysts. During this testing the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) will also be verified. This testing will only be accomplished by the COTA after the DTT has successfully installed the system operationally.

39

The COTA will bring together a representative group of analysts to assist in this testing to make the PPD testing as close to real operations as possible. For these tests it is acceptable to have reduced number of analysts because the system may be scaled down from the final fully operational system. However, it is anticipated that the PPD testing will be conducted at a minimum of two different locations simultaneously. This will be done to simulate a Continuity of Operations (COOP) ready operation. The test scenarios and test procedures developed by the COTA will be used well before this point of testing. These scenarios will be required to be a near exact representation of the real operations that are seen daily during normal operations. A second PPD is not planned; however, a second PPD will be conducted only if it is necessary as a means to address PM approved corrections or modifications as a result of operator requests for improvements. At the completion of the PPD the COTA will complete a full SER, of their testing with recommendations for system deployment. This report will be provided to OIT, who will write their recommendations for commencing deployment. Typically there could be many phases of independent testing. Examples include: Early Operational Assessment (EOA), Operational Assessment (OA), Independent Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) and several others. As described above the TIM program's independent testing will be accomplished by the COTA throughout the entire testing program, but most specifically during the PPD phase of the development cycle. It is anticipated that after this testing the development will be completed and the program will deploy the system for full operational use. The approach described here is consistent with the DHS Project Tailoring Plan, which is designed to save time and cost for development. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) instruction "DHS IT Project Tailoring Plan Template," January 26, 2009 prepared by the Office of Information Technology and signed by the Chief Information Officer, provides justification for proceeding with a tailored developmental approach as stated below: "Each project is required to tailor the DHS System Engineering Life Cycle (SELC) to make it consistent with the project needs. Tailoring promotes flexibility in the process to address unique project variations based on programmatic requirements, application domains, solution approaches and tradeoffs in cost, schedule and quality. However, the flexibility must be balanced by a need to support DHS standards, objectives and strategies so that process lessons learned can be used by all projects to improve productivity and quality by improving the process." 2. CRITICAL OPERATIONAL ISSUES TIM must examine Critical Operational Issues (COIs), or the operational effectiveness and operational suitability issues during PPD to evaluate the system's capability to safely perform its mission. Table D-1 below lists the COI, separated by Measures of Operational Effectiveness (MOE) and Measures of Operational Suitability (MOS), for the TIM program.

3. OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUATION TO DATE The TTAC Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) program is currently in the planning and program development phase. Testing will commence during the development phase of the program. When the development contract has been awarded it is anticipated that the testing will commence soon after development starts to make progress. To date the TIM testing concept has been incorporated in Sections C and D of this TEMP. Since this TEMP is considered a living document, the Contractor Operational Test Agent (COTA) will update this document at the appropriate time. The TIM PM plans to have a Development Test Team (DTT), and Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) test team and a COTA. The IV&V test team will be active during the development phase of the program. Their testing duties will conclude after System Acceptance Testing (SAT); however, they will provide support and reporting input at Acquisition Decision Event Three (ADE3). 4. PLANNED OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUATION As discussed above in the Overview Section the final system testing for certification will be conducted by an independent contractor. This independent contractor will be under the auspices of the Office of Information Technology (OIT). OIT will contract for an independent test team, with experience in conducting Operational Testing Assessments, to do independent testing and fulfill the duties of the OTA for the government. OIT will provide the management oversight for the COTA, thus ensuring that they are independent from the program office. The final testing will be conducted during the Pilot Production Deployment (PPD) phase of development. The primary purpose of this final independent COTA testing will be to determine if the system is operationally effective and suitable and verify the Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) are satisfactorily met. All of this testing will be in an operational environment albeit reduced in size to accommodate a small but representative real world system. The intent is to make this phase of testing a small real world test environment. a. Configuration Description System Acceptance Testing will be conducted by the COTA and this will be the prelude into the full operational test. It will be conducted on the development test system and it will involve a small number of users. The DTT will not be allowed to participate other than answering system related questions during this testing. This test will be conducted by the COTA team and will essentially be an Early Operational Assessment (EOA). Any problem reports that are identified during this testing will be corrected prior to proceeding to PPD. At the completion of System Acceptance Testing (SAT) and after the appropriate reviews and approvals the system used for SAT will then be deployed to at least two (or more) different field sites for simultaneous testing. The system will be installed in an

43

operational system and fully integrated and operating with live real world data. At these designated test field sites, operational users will be assigned to assist in this testing and make the testing as close to real world operations as possible. The PPD test system will be the same system that completed SAT. The only difference in the system used for the PPD testing is that this system will be an operational system, using an uploaded legacy database and in the operational environment. The PPD test system configuration will be fully integrated with the operational system as much as possible, given that the PPD test system is a totally new data structure. If necessary because of this new data structure the PPD test system may have to be a standalone system to prevent incompatibility issues with the current legacy system. b. Operational Test and Evaluation Objectives The testing during this phase of the project will be conducted by the COTA. The COTA will have been involved throughout the development and developmental testing phase of the program, but during these early phases of testing they will maintain their independence from the DTT. During developmental testing phase the COTA will have evaluated the testing program, reviewed all the test plans and procedures and conducted tests of their own, while maintaining their independence from the DTT and the Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V)Team. The final testing will be completed independently from the DTT and it will be conducted during PPD phase. The testing by the COTA will shift test strategies to achieve the following objectives:  Determine that the system performance meets the KPPs while operating in the production environment.  Provide operational performance evaluation including operational effectiveness, suitability, reliability, availability and maintainability.  Evaluate the system using the operators that will use the system on a daily basis and evaluate the effectiveness of the operator training.  Evaluate the interface between the system and the user (human factors engineering).  Complete a written System Evaluation Report (SER) of the Independent testing conducted during PPD testing phase, with recommendations regarding deployment and possible future enhancements for the system. The SER will be provided to OIT as input to their decision to recommend approval for deployment. c. Operational Test and Evaluation Events, Scope of Testing, and Scenarios The criteria to enter this phase of testing will be a successful completion of the System Acceptance Testing (SAT) followed by the Approval to Operate (ATO) and Approvals to Proceed (ATP) which will be addressed at the Operational Readiness Review (ORR). All of these approvals will be accompanied by the Certification and Accreditation obtained through the Security Test and Evaluation (STE) testing. The testing will then proceed into the PPD phase of testing. PPD is conducted by the COTA team only and without the operational assistance of the DTT after the system has

44

been installed at two or more separate operation sites. PPD testing will be conducted at field sites by analysts currently using the legacy system. Logistics/maintenance support is needed during PPD and will be at the discretion of the lead COTA team members. The COTA may request logistics/maintenance assistance from both the development and test teams to expedite and keep the testing moving according to the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS). The COTA team will annotate this assistance in their final PPD report and consider it in their recommendations for system approval. The COTA team will collect data for analysis during the PPD. They will also bring in test data already collected during their independent reviews of Developmental Test data during the earlier Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E) testing by the DTT. The COTA is responsible for analyzing all of the test data and completing a final System Evaluation Report with recommendations for submittal to Office of Informaiton Technology (OIT) for approval. The COTA activities essentially have been conducted throughout the entire system development cycle. However, PPD testing is the final hard look at the system on the live system and it will use live legacy data. OTA may include many testing activities and the following list is representative of the tests that should be considered by the COTA prior to completing their test plan for the PPD. The PPD activities proposed by the vendor will need government approval via the Project Manager's signature on the PPD Test Plan.

This completes the PPD testing and based on the recommendations, the system will then move forward to obtain the Authority to Operate (ATO). The entry criteria for PPD are:  Successful completion of SAT testing.  Completion of a back out plan ­ a plan that provides procedures for restoring the system to its original pre-test condition. This is needed in the event the new system causes problems to operations.  Approval obtained during the OTRR3 and ORR.  Continuation of ATO obtained before PPD testing.  Successful completion of all the applicable items in the OTRR3 checklist, which will be provided by the COTA. The end of the test program will be marked with successful completion of the PPD, the approval of the final PPD test System evaluation Report and a favorable letter of assessment. d. Limitations At this writing the program is in the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) phase. Thus, there are no identified technical limitations that could affect the testing on this program. As the program matures and a dedicated design is developed, limitations will be considered and this document will be revised accordingly. 5. OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUATION PLANS AND REPORTS The COTA team will prepare a PPD test plan document as a deliverable to the Government. This document will be delivered prior to SAT. A slide presentation describing the plan will be provided to the government team at OTRR3. Other test documents and reports are listed in Table D-3. Activity

Section E. Test and Evaluation Resource Summary
1. SUMMARY This section describes key Developmental and Operational T&E resources, required to complete the Modernization Program Developmental Test & Evaluation (DT&E) and Operational Test & Evaluaiton (OT&E). Specific resources needed for testing above what is presented in this TEMP will be detailed in the related test plans. 1.1 TEST ARTICLES Test articles are provided by the TTAC Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) Program Office and/or TSA. Testing facilities will be determined at a later date. Test articles will consist of a work station for each Developer and Developer Test Team (DTT) members, and computers for compiling the new software after it is unit tested. The systems will include two test systems: one dedicated for testing by the DTT and one dedicated for developing and unit testing by the developer team and finally requisite licenses for development and test software. The test systems will be a system that will emulate the final production system (operational system) as closely as possible. 1.2 TEST SUPPORT EQUIPMENT Each Developmental tester will have a work station and requisite test and administration software. Development test personnel will use one of two test systems as described above, as well as legacy system hardware and software. There will be separate computers for compiling software prior to testing by the DTT. Each tester will have appropriate test software and licenses to use the software for developing and testing purposes. During Operational testing each user will be provided a work station and requisite test and administration software. Users will be provided with systems configured (hardware, software and footprint) as to be fielded. 1.3 MODELS AND SIMULATION DT&E efforts are focused on identifying and mitigating risks associated with achieving technical objectives identified in the specifications. Modeling and Simulation (M&S) will be applied if necessary and appropriate.

Table to be updated with completion of the AoA and award of contract Table E-1 - Test and Evaluation Funding Requirements 1.5 MANPOWER/TRAINING The following manpower estimates are assuming the testing will require one shift. Depending on pressure to progress faster, manpower and shifts may be increased to meet performance goals. The manpower planning is divided into separate contracts for the various functions required to thoroughly test this new development. The Developer contractor will provide not only the developers, but will also create a Developer Test Team (DTT) consisting of approximately ten (10) dedicated testers. These testers will be initially brought in in stages. The first two or three testers will be experienced testers and will begin writing the Test Plan and any test procedures that can be written at this early development stage. As the software progresses, the remaining testers will be brought in to begin testing as the software units are developed. There will also be two (2) trained technicians who will compile the software in preparation for testing by the DTT. These two groups will be part of the Prime Developer contract. There will also be two independent test teams. The first team is the Contractor Operational Test Agent (COTA) and they will consist of four (4) to six (6) contractors of experienced testers. The COTA contract will be instituted and managed by TSA's Office of Information Technology (OIT). OIT will contract and manage the COTA. This contractual arrangement is necessary to maintain independence and separation from the program office to ensure that the final product meets all the operational needs. The Second test team is the IV&V test team. This team will also be independent from the PMO and will be responsible for conformity to the requirements and that the software satisfies its intended use and users needs. The IV&V team will consist of approximately four (4) experienced testers. The IV&V and COTA teams will be independent of each other. The COTA will also be independent from the PMO. There will be a Certification and Accreditation (C&A) team consisting of approximately eight (8) people. They will be responsible for security testing the system leading C&A. The program can then move into an operational phase of testing and eventually deployment. This team will be a separate contract from the contracts mentioned above. Finally there will be a complement of full time Infrastructure Team of approximately seven (7) people. This team will be responsible for setting up and keeping all the test hardware up and

48

running properly. They will also obtain software applications that will be needed for development and testing. This team will also be a separate contract from those mentioned above. 1.5.1 Training Training will be necessary prior to starting System Acceptance Testing (SAT) and also prior to the Pilot Production Deployment (PDD) testing. During this training there will be several operational people who will be needed to assist the COTA team in testing the system independently in an operational mode. This training is anticipated to be needed for as many as thirty (30) operational people. The developer will deliver a training package which the government will use as input for the government training program. 2. RESOURCE SUMMARY UPDATES No resource summary at this time. 2.1 REQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY MATRIX (RTM) The Developer Test Team (DTT) will be responsible for delivering the RTM. The RTM is expected to be done after unit testing at Test Readiness Review One (TRR 1).

Task Order 1 ­ Award Fee Determination Plan

Solicitation HSTS02-11-R-TTCXXX

A. Introduction
A.1 Purpose
This Award Fee Determination Plan establishes the basis for managing the TTAC Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) program award fee program for Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) task orders issued under contract HSTS02-11-R-TTCXXX. The AFDP is applicable only to Task Order 1, Task 1 Develop the Foundation TIM Architecture and Task 3 - Implementation. The purpose of the plan is to establish an incentive system for encouraging and rewarding excellent performance by the TSA/TTAC Prime Contractor (hereafter "Contractor"). The award fee objective for this task order is to afford the Industry Partner an opportunity to earn award fee commensurate with performance by: ˇ ˇ ˇ Providing a workable award fee plan with a high probability of successful implementation. Clearly communicating evaluation procedures that provide effective two-way communication between the Industry Partner and the Government. Focusing the Industry Partner on areas of greatest importance to the Government in order to motivate outstanding performance.

Determining the amount of the Award Fee earned and payable to the Contractor for achieving specified levels of performance will be determined by the Award Fee Determining Official (AFDO) in accordance with this Plan. The AFDO, with the assistance of the Award Fee Evaluation Board (AFEB) and the input from Performance Monitors, will make the determination. The amount of the Award Fee is the maximum fee payable. The Contractor may earn all, part, or none of the Award Fee allocated to the evaluation period.

A.2 Payment
An award fee pool shall be established for the CPAF task order and an award fee score shall be developed for each award fee evaluation period. The Award Fee Determination Official will determine the amount of award fee earned and payable for each award fee period. The award fee will be based upon a review of the Contractor's performance and established performance evaluation criteria set forth in this plan.

A.3 Collaborative Development of Award Fee Plans
Although the Government is the final decision authority regarding the content of award fee plans and reserves the right to unilaterally develop such plans, the Government contemplates developing award fee plans in a collaborative process with the Contractor. As the program moves towards implementation, the award fee will be focused more on cost and schedule. As such, the Government reserves the right to realign performance area weights prior to the start of the next award fee period.

B. Evaluation Period and Allocation Formula
Evaluation periods will be semi-annual for Task Order 1. Award fee determinations will be made on or before the 30th calendar day, or the next workday, following each evaluation period.

B.1 Award Fee Allocation Formula
The fee pool allocated to each evaluation period will be as follows:

B.1.1

Base Fee

The Base fee is no greater than 2%. The dollar amount of the maximum award fee pool is identified in the QASP Contractor Performance Section. The maximum award fee, as established by award fee allocation formula, may be allocated to each criteria or evaluation period as follows: a. b. c. Equal Allocation (e.g., total Award Fee divided by the number of periods). Special Allocation (e.g., 25% in the first period and 75% for the final period). Proportional Allocation (e.g., incurred costs of each period divided by the total estimated cost times 100% of the maximum award fee)

B.1.2

Maximum Award Fee Pool

The total award fee pool for Task Order One is not to exceed $5,000,000.

Adjective
Excellent

Description
The cumulative Schedule Performance Index (SPI) (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed divided by the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled) is .97 or greater. Further, the Contractor aggressively uses its Earned Value Management methodology to manage and control the program schedule. Relevant data is accurate to the point that reported schedule variances are reflective of actual task order schedule performance. Schedule variance analyses accurately describe the causes, corrective actions, and potential impacts associated with each variance. Minor requirements for unscheduled support are absorbed within schedule. Constant review of schedules reflects effective management of the schedule and long-term prospects exist for completing the project earlier than planned. Management shows innovation and initiative in reducing individual and overall program schedules. The cumulative SPI is greater than .95. Further, the Contractor uses its Earned Value Methodology as a tool to institute aggressive management practices that result in minor schedule slips and reflect the potential for long-term management of the project within the projected schedule. Relevant data is accurate to the point that reported schedule variances are usually reflective of actual task order schedule performance. Usually, schedule variance analyses accurately describe the causes, corrective actions, and potential impacts associated with each variance. Management aggressively pursues opportunities to compress schedules where practical. The cumulative SPI is greater than .90. Further, the Contractor is disciplined in integrating its Scheduling data into its Earned Value Methodology and uses the system as a tool for evaluating and initiating tradeoffs to control schedule slips. Reported schedule variances are often not reflective of actual task order schedule performance. Schedule variance analyses often do not accurately describe the causes, corrective actions, or potential impacts associated with each variance. Few delays have an adverse schedule or cost impact to this or related program activities. Minimum Government intervention is required. If the Schedule Performance Area cannot be rated "Excellent", "Above Average", or "Below Average", it will be rated Below Average.

Solicitation HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

SECTION C ­ Performance Work Statement 1. Introduction 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of Task Order 1 described in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is for the design and development of the Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC) Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) system and migrate the Maritime population. In addition, this Task Order has an optional task to provide support for Operation and Maintenance of the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) Legacy System.

1.2 Background
The mission of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is to protect the nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. The mission of TSA's Office of Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing is to reduce the probability of a successful terrorist or other criminal attack to the transportation system through application of the threat assessment methodologies that are intended to identify known or suspected terrorist or other threats working on or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system. TTAC serves as the lead for all Security Threat Assessments and credentialing initiatives for transportation industry workers, individuals seeking access to critical infrastructure, and travelers. In support of its mission, TTAC needs to carry out the following activities:
ˇ

ˇ

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

Provide Security Threat Assessments for various populations traveling into, out of, or within the United States to identify terrorist or other threats to the transportation and critical infrastructure sectors Provide enrollment and credentialing services used by individuals to gain unescorted access to special, sterile, and/or secure areas after successfully completing a Security Threat Assessment Offer screening services to support eligibility for unescorted access to special, sterile, and/or secure areas where credentials may not be provided or required Conduct recurrent vetting (checks daily) on over 20 million individuals against the consolidated federal watch list and other derogatory data sets Engage a wide range of transportation stakeholders who require secure credentials to address current and emerging threats to the transportation industry Perform end-to-end program management for aviation, maritime, and surface programs with core capabilities in enrollment services, vetting operations, adjudication, and credential management

The current TTAC Security Threat Assessment infrastructure was not built as an integrated set of capabilities to support multiple programs. The current TTAC vetting and credentialing services are limited by aging and stove-piped information resource management processes and tools as depicted in Figure 1, TTAC As-Is Architecture. The current TTAC vetting and credentialing enterprise architecture was created to support 2.5 million individuals per year. Today, the populations supported by TTAC have increased to 12.5 million individuals per year. The

expected serviced populations are to grow to 20 million individuals within the next two years and increase to a projected 40 to 50 million individuals within the next five years. As a result, TTAC must modernize its current infrastructure to meet the TSA mission capabilities and be scalable to meet the mission needs of current and future populations.

2. Scope
The scope of this Task Order is to secure the required products and services to (a) design, build, and transition the new TIM system and (b) migrate the maritime population into the TIM system. The TIM architecture shall be flexible, agile, and scalable to support the migration of all existing populations and new populations into the TIM system. This Task Order is to migrate the maritime population first; however, the migration of the remaining populations (surface, aviation, others) into the TIM system will be phased-in through subsequent task orders. (Reference Appendix D for the schedule for migrating the TSA/TTAC populations.) The TIM system shall provide the core business services for credentialing, which are listed in Table 1 below in accordance with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Screening Credentialing Office (SCO) Credentialing Framework Initiative (CFI), dated July 2008.
Table 1. List of Credentialing Services Service
Registration and Enrollment Eligibility Vetting and Risk Assessment Issuance

Definition
Receipt and initial processing of an application for a license, privilege, or status that may or may not require a physical credential. Determination of an individual's eligibility for a requested license, privilege, or status through STA. The technical data movement and storage for production and personalization of a credential that will serve as a mechanism to identify individuals that have been granted a license, privilege, or status. Issuance includes the delivery of a personalized credential. The actual presentation of the credential by the holder or use by the decision-maker to verify the license, privilege, or status and the identity of the bearer. It includes making a determination that the credential presented is authentic, that the individual presenting the document is the one to whom it was issued or granted, and the license, privilege, or status is valid. Efforts taken to terminate a valid license, privilege, or status and associated credential based on new information or expiration. Receipt of a request, determination of misidentification, or waivability of a Watchlist/lookout match, overriding the match for subsequent encounters, where appropriate, and posting of results. A view across select process segments or population segments such that notable or unusual trends across populations or lifecycle phases are highlighted and can be used for decision or information analysis.

8. Special Contract Requirements 8.1 8.2 Performance Standards Award Fee ­ General

Award fees will be applicable to the Contractor's performance of all cost plus task orders issued under this contract. The award fee is applicable to Task 1 - Develop the Foundation TIM Architecture and Task 3 - Implementation. The amount of the award fee that the Contractor actually earns will be based on a performance assessment by the Government of the evaluation factors specified in the Award Fee Determination Plan. The evaluation of the Contractor's performance and the determination of award fees will be accomplished with the Award Fee Determination Plan. The Award Fee Determination Official (AFDO) will unilaterally determine the amount of award fee for performance on Task Order1 issued during the evaluation period. The Contractor shall be promptly advised in writing of the determination and reasons why the award fee was, was not or partially earned by the AFDO.

8.2.1 Award Fee Determination Plan
The Government will unilaterally establish an Award Fee Determination Plan and performance evaluation process for Task1 - CPAF task orders. Contractor performance will be evaluated according to the Award Fee Determination Plan. The Contractor will be periodically informed of the quality of its performance and areas in which improvements are expected. For application to task orders, this plan will include the criteria used to evaluate each area of performance and the percentage of award fee (if any) available for each area. The Contractor shall submit self-evaluations of performance for each period under consideration. These self-evaluations will be considered by the Award Fee Evaluation Board (AFEB), led by the Award Fee Determining Official, in reaching its determination. Detailed information pertaining to the AFEB and AFDO will be provided to the Contractor upon award and maintained in the task order file. The Award Fee Determination Plan is located in Section J of this solicitation.

Appendix G. TTAC Program Overview
TTAC Capability Description The TTAC mission capabilities address enrollment and credentialing, security threat assessment and vetting, and adjudication and redress. Enrollment The Enrollment approach currently is dependent on the enrollment requirements of each population representing surface, maritime, and aviation transportation workers; as well as other specific populations requiring a full or partial security threat assessment services (for example, individuals accessing non-transportation but critical or sensitive areas or materials ). Enrollments currently are conducted in person and on line via a web portal or TSA provided user interface, third party vendors, and/or TSA contractors supported by a number of enrollment systems and system components.

Maritime Enrollment: The enrollment registration, identity verification, immigration verification, activation, and issuance for the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) maritime population are done at in-person enrollment locations across the continental United States and United States Territories. The enrollment sites in the US are centered primarily around ports located on the west coast, east coast, great lakes, and gulf coast. The enrollment work stations located at these enrollment sites are an integral part of the TWIC system. The TWIC system interfaces with the Consolidated Screening Gateway (CSG) with the biometric and biographic information format defined by the CSG Interface Control Document (IDC). For TWIC port workers a successful Security Threat Assessment results in the receipt of a TWIC (TSA issued biometric credential) allowing for access to secure areas in a port or to hold a Merchant Mariner's license. The TWIC system and enrollment sites are managed under a single contract. Surface Enrollment: The enrollment registration, identity verification, and immigration verification for current Hazardous Material Endorsement (HME) surface population is conducted at in-person enrollment locations in 39 States including the District of Columbia across the continental US or through State specific enrollment systems and resources for 12 states conducting enrollments themselves and submitting the applicant information to TSA electronically via TSA provided user interface, XML third party data feed and the FBI. . The in-person enrollment sites are managed by a single contractor. The biometric and biographic information format is defined by the Screening Gateway (SG) ICD. For HME drivers a successful Security Threat Assessment (STA) results in an HME endorsement on the drivers commercial driver's license allowing the driver to haul hazardous material. All States access a TSA provided web portal to track and download STA status and information for HME applicants. Other DHS populations that are leveraging TTAC STA services are collecting biographic and/or biometric information from individuals seeking access to critical infrastructure or sensitive materials/information and intend to submit to the Office of Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC) and processed through the CSG. The required information format is defined by the CSG ICD. Only unsuccessful STA results are submitted to the submitting DHS program. Other new surface populations may follow this concept and tailor the collection and submission to TTAC based on the program specific STA requirements. Aviation Enrollment: The enrollment registration and identity verification for individuals in the aviation industry including TSA regulated pilots, airport vendors, and cargo handlers, are submitted through a 3rd party vendor, TSA user interface or at airports as an integral part of the multiple regulated aviation programs' security processes. The enrollment criteria are defined differently between individual aviation programs. The biographic and/or biometric information format is defined by the CSG ICD. The successful completion of the STA may result in specific airport access or airport issued media, access to cargo or other access privileges specific to the aviation program. Federal Aviation Administration submits the names of FAA certificate holders to TTAC for a name based check for ties to terrorism. Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP) conducts enrollment registration, identity verification, and immigration status through a web application portal and fingerprint enrollment sites located in the US and abroad. A successful

STA allows the individual to enroll in a flight training program. Flight training providers access the TSA system to assist student enrollment, verify the STA and update the individuals STA application record. Credentialing Currently the only physical credentialing requirement is for maritime workers who require unescorted access to secure areas in ports. The TWIC system supports the maritime credentialing process with the card management system and card personalization system as integral components of the TWIC system. Card stock is provided under the TWIC contract. Card personalization is performed at United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) owned, contractor operated facility in Corbin, Kentucky. Card personalization consists of the following processes: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Card stock, holographic laminate, and back laminate inventories are maintained at the production facility to meet production needs. Card stock is personalized by printing, injecting machine-readable information on the contact and contactless chips and laminating card; Personalized cards are submitted to a quality and control check; Cards are prepared for shipping to applicant's enrollment center by express carrier; Shipping labels are printed and shipped; and The appropriate card status information is entered into the Card Management System (CMS).

In the card issuance process, personalized cards are shipped to the enrollment center at which the applicant enrolled or to an alternate enrollment center location if specified during enrollment. The Trusted Agent accepts the shipment by scanning the bar code label, at which time the individuals whose cards are in the shipment are automatically notified, via email or phone, that their card is at the enrollment site ready for pick up. Once the worker arrives at the enrollment site to receive his card, the Trusted Agent checks the applicant's identification, certificates are loaded on the card, and a biometric match of the applicant's live-scan fingerprint is checked against that stored on the TWIC. After successful match, the worker selects a PIN#, the TWIC is locked, given a final quality check, and recorded as "activated" by the TWIC system and issued to the applicant. The TWIC prototype card currently contains multiple technologies: ˇ ˇ Dual Interface Integrated Circuit Chip with contactless and contact features; Linear Bar Code.

Security Threat Assessment The Security Threat Assessment (STA) is the process through which applicants are screened to determine their eligibility to receive a credential, or endorsement, or notification of a cleared security threat assessment depending on the eligibility requirements for access or work. The Screening Gateway systems are systems that support the security threat assessment and vetting process which may include any combination of the following: ˇ Name-based terrorist threat assessment Fingerprint-based and name-based Criminal History Records Check (CHRC) by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); and

ˇ ˇ

Lawful presence determination through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service's Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program; Open wants and warrants check through the National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

Additional Populations such as CVP, FAA, etc., submit data to CSOC for name based terrorist checks via the APIS feed. Data from the enrollment is sent to various system interfaces to allow the STA process to proceed. The STA process is conducted by the Government, with completed STA results provided back to the enrollment system. Depending on the program for which the applicant is enrolling, results of the STA are sent to 1) the TWIC system; 2) to the individual HME applicant and State licensing authority; 3) to the airport personnel security/badging office; 4) flight training provider, 5) air cargo security coordinator or designee and 6) other designated sources. The Screening Gateway Systems support the STA process. Adjudication and Redress When there is incomplete information to determine eligibility or records show that the eligibility of the individual worker is in question the case is submitted for manual adjudication. Contractor and Government adjudicators review the case documents to determine the status of eligibility. If there is information in the case that may indicate the applicant may be ineligible or there is insufficient information to successfully complete the STA, a letter of Initial Determination of Ineligibility (formerly known as Initial Determination of Eligibility requesting additional information is sent to the individual with details and instructions for submitting additional information that may facilitate the successful completion of the STA. Cases where additional information such as corrections, updated documentation or clarifications may resolve the adjudicator's concerns or issues are addressed as an "Appeal." Appeals typically relate to cases such as but not limited to incomplete or missing lawful presence documentation, clarification regarding arrests or convictions that indicate they are not related to associated STA criminal disqualifiers or corrections to submitted and previously reviewed records. For cases where the individual is initially ineligible due to, criminal history and/or immigration reasons, a request for a "Waiver" can be submitted." Waivers relate to cases for which the applicant records indicate an actual STA disqualification and the individuals is providing additional information to be reviewed by a Waiver Review Board. The eligibility criteria to receive a credential and/or to receive a "green" successful STA result may vary across programs. Once the case is adjudicated as "green" the successful STA status is sent to the originating system or program.

Maintaining the interfaces to the various systems with which TWIC will exchange information

The TWIC system includes a revocation capability component. TWICs that are reported as lost, stolen or damaged shall be revoked in the TWIC system. TWICs may also be revoked by the Government if an individual who was previously issued a TWIC is subsequently determined to pose a security threat. Additionally, the site can download the revoked database list or conduct a real time check through the internet. The TWIC system, in support of the United States Coast Guard (USCG), maintains a data mart populated with biometric and biographic information on Merchant Mariners or potential Merchant Mariners who have enrolled for a TWIC. The USCG has direct access to the information. Screening Gateway/Consolidated Screening Gateway Functionality provided by the SG/CSG includes application ingest, applicant adjudication, unique biometric identification, credential management, and applicant status management. It does this by interfacing with multiple interfacing enrollment-systems, multiple interfacing vetting systems, the Adjudication Center, and the Document-Printing-Scanning-Mailing (DPSM) facility. The SG/CSG currently processes applications for the following TSA Programs: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) Aviation Worker (AW) Hazardous Material Endorsement (HME) Indirect Air Carrier (IAC) Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP).

The SG consists of a collection of infrastructure (i.e., high-speed data processing, electronic storage, internal network communications system components, external system interfaces and application software, etc.) that, in total, is capable of accommodating a number of different transportation security threat assessment programs for DHS, TSA or any other Federal agency, each with distinct programmatic and mission-specific vetting requirements. Based on the needs and requirements of each program, TTAC SG has the capability to customize workflow, databases, and applications used to process the security threat assessments of the programs' populations. The TTAC Screening Operations mission support functions include, but are not limited to:

The interfacing-enrollment-systems, which support these Programs, send applicant information to the SG which then sends vetting information requests to interfacing-vetting-systems. These interfacing-vetting-systems respond with vetting information, which is used to determine the suitability of the applicant to receive the credentials for which they are applying, via standardized Screening Gateway Adjudication/Redress Processes. The end result of the SG processing is issuance of a Security Threat Assessment (STA) decision. This STA decision and the applicant status are provided to multiple stakeholders through a variety of notification mechanisms. Alien Flight Student Program System (AFSP) AFSP purpose is to identify and prevent individuals who pose a threat to national and aviation security from receiving flight training in the U.S. This capability is accomplished by requiring applicants to submit detailed information that goes through an extensive vetting and adjudication process. The adjudication results determine whether or not to authorize or deny flight training. On December 12, 2003, Congress enacted Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. Section 612 of Vision 100 makes several changes to 49 U.S.C. 44939; paramount was the transfer of the threat assessment requirements from the Department of Justice (DOJ) Attorney General to the Secretary of DHS, TSA. It also required the Secretary to issue an interim final rule (IFR) implementing Section 612.

The IFR prohibits a flight school from providing flight training to aliens and other individuals designated by TSA (candidates) unless the flight school or the candidate submits certain information to TSA, the candidate remits the specified fee to TSA, and TSA determines that the candidate is not a threat to aviation or national security. The IFR is applicable to cover "a person operating as a flight instructor, pilot school, or aviation training center or subject to regulation under this part." Providers and applicants must supply for various categories of identifying information in order to train in both the operation of aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of greater than 12,500 pounds as well as 12,500 pounds and less. The time allotted to complete a full threat assessment on every applicant was reduced from 45 to 30 days. The IFR further requires that the period for completing threat assessments on pilots who are employed by a foreign air carrier that is certified under 14 CFR part 129 and that has a security program approved under 49 CFR part 1546, does not exceed 5 days. In addition, AFSP is required to notify students and providers of the status of their application and the receipt of materials they provide. The system will also control and monitor the collections of required fees that certain applicants are charged to cover the costs of the assessment. There are four categories of applicants within the program.
ˇ

ˇ

ˇ

ˇ

Category 1 is for candidates who are not eligible for expedited processing for flight training in the operation of aircraft weighing greater than 12,500 pounds. The time period to complete this categories assessment is 30 days. Category 2 is for candidates who are eligible for expedited processing for flight training in the operation of aircraft weighing greater than 12,500 pounds. The time period to complete this category assessment is 5 days. Category 3 is for candidates applying for flight training in the operation of aircraft weighing 12,500 pounds or less. The time period to complete this category assessment is 0 days from receiving the completed application. Category 4 is for candidates applying for recurrent training.

Candidates in Categories 1-3 are required to submit training information, such as the type of training the candidate is requesting, and identifying information, including fingerprints. Flight schools are required to submit similar training and identifying information for candidates in Category 4, but are not required to submit the candidates' fingerprints. TSA intends to use a process for submitting information similar to the current DOJ process, including the use of the same website for applying and submitting information to TSA. In addition to complying with the rules of the IFR, the AFSP software application program collects information about providers, provider agents, Flight Standard District Office's (FSDO), and administrators. The system allows certain levels of query to privileged identification (ID) and the tracking of the provider's applicants and the state of the applications. The system is also used by the AFSP program's Customer Relations Team (CRT), AFSP analysts, AFSP investigators, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) agents, and TSA Administration. AFSP became fully operational on October 5, 2004 Crew Vetting System/Platform

The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) directs TSA to assume the prescreening function for aircraft crew operators. To accomplish this mandate, TSA developed the CVP which compares information on the crew to established Government Data Sets. The CVP uses a consolidated set of derogatory and non-derogatory Government reference data sets; access to commercial identity authentication services (where approved and required); a menu of flexible vetting techniques; and a centralized work-flow engine implemented with a flexible, modern, open architecture. It offers economies of scale in data acquisition and data management, as well as the consolidation of the intelligence and analytic resources capable of supporting a variety of TSA programs concurrently through workload balancing The CVP operates and accepts inputs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24 x 7). Data inputs are vetted against reference datasets. Potential security risks are identified to other Government agencies for specific action. In addition, the CVP provides the means for internal adjudication of security risks. Hazardous Threat Assessment Materials Endorsement Program (HTAP) The Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) web application (https://hazmat.dhs.gov) is part of the TSA Screening Gateway. The HME application is designed to supply a semi-automated mechanism for aggregating data associated with the background checks for applicants who wish to obtain a Hazardous Materials Endorsement to a commercial driver's license. All fifty states and the District of Columbia submit applications to the HME application for processing. These fifty-one jurisdictions (states) need to check on the status of the applications and do additional checks on applications from different states. The State Portal project (https://hazmat.dhs.gov/sp/) creates a robust set of functions that allow the 50 states and the District of Columbia to securely access reports detailing the progress of their applications. The State Portal provides a simple web accessible interface with secure user login and defined roles. The State Portal software architecture consists of two distinct layers of code: a presentation layer and a service layer. The Applicant Intake Portal (AIP) is a web application (https://hazmat.dhs.gov/aip/) used by transportation credential seeking applicants. The AIP allows holders of CDLs to complete an online application for an HME. Once certified by the state's licensing agency, the application data is transmitted directly to TSA. States may also enter application data for transmission to TSA. Direct entry of applicant data improves data accuracy, which speeds the evaluation process significantly. The portal works as a source of data for the Hazardous Material Endorsement Screening Gateway (HMESG), which is part of the Consolidated Screening Gateway (CSG). Incoming applicant data is accepted from the website and is processed. Reporting Management Subsystem As part of modernization efforts, TTAC business owners invested in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) business intelligence and data warehouse products that enable the integration of reporting functions across all TTAC programs and offices, including Security Threat Assessment

The initial implementation was deployed on the Screening Gateway (SG) infrastructure as the Reporting Management Subsystem (RMS). RMS comprises the following COTS products: Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) and Informatica Power Center. Within OBIEE, the back-end Oracle BI Administration Tool permits developers to create the data mappings for reporting. The front-end Oracle Business Intelligence interface provides the facility for business users to interact with dashboards and reports. Informatica enables the technology team to configure the automated ETL (extracttransform-load) processes.

TWIC Card Production System

The Card Production system interfaces with the Card Management System. The card personalization facility initiates the card personalization process (printing and chip encoding processes.) The personalization data includes the information to be printed on the card such as name and photo, as well as the information that resides on the card's integrated circuit chip (ICC) that includes the biometric templates for identity verification, electronic keys, and the biographical data printed on the card. The biographical information is duplicated between the card printing and the ICC to enhance the chain of trust between the chip, the card, and the individual, as all elements must agree for the credential to be valid. The card payload is generated as a card request from the TWIC IDMS is sent to the TWIC CMS. Then the formatted personalization data is securely submitted via encrypted SSL connection over a dedicated point to point T1 link from the TWIC CMS to the Card Personalization System (CPS) located at the federal card personalization facility in Corbin, KY operated by Government employees and contractors of the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). TSA holds the contract with the USCIS for production of cards.

The fullyburdened labor rates include all labor and labor-related costs, such as, but not limited to, the following list of representative labor-related costs: salaries, wages, bonuses to include stock bonuses, incentive awards, employee stock options, stock appreciation rights, employee stock ownership plans, employee insurance, fringe benefits, contributions to pension, other post-retirement benefits, annuity, employee incentive compensation plans, incentive pay, shift differentials, overtime, vacation time, sick pay, holidays, and all other allowances that should be included in a comprehensive employee compensation plan. The Government requires the contractor to state how many hours is their equivalent to a full time employee. (1) Government Site Rates. These rates shall be used when contractor personnel are performing at Government site. The Government will provide reasonable work space, furniture, equipment and supplies, as specified in the individual Orders. (2) Contractor Site Rates. These rates shall be used when contractor personnel are performing at the Contractor's own facility/site. The Contractor shall furnish all office space, supplies, materials and services required to perform the work. This includes, but is not limited to, telephones, faxes, copiers, personal computers, postage (to include courier services such as Federal Express), ordinary business software (e.g., word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, etc.), normal copying and reproduction costs. (3) Other Direct Costs. The Other Direct Costs (ODCs) are for order-related travel. The cost of general-purpose items required for the conduct of the Contractor's normal business operations will not be considered an allowable ODC in the performance of orders under this contract. Only travel authorized in writing by the COTR prior to expenditure shall be reimbursed.

B.4.1.1 Fixed Price Task Orders (TOs) For FFP type task orders, the quantity of each item or labor category ordered as negotiated for the task will be multiplied against the rate(s) listed in this schedule, and the cumulative extended total of all items ordered will define the lump sum fixed price for the TO. Discounts from these rates may be obtained at the time of negotiation. Travel costs will be in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR), if applicable, and may be estimated for each TO and will be funded on a NTE basis. Travel shall remain separate from the total fixed price for labor and ODCs and will be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation. B.4.1.2 T&M Task Orders (TOs) For T&M type TOs, the quantity of hours ordered from each labor category will be specified as deliverable hours billable at the ceiling rates specified in the Section B.5 Pricing Rate Tables or as negotiated, if lower rates are proposed for TO. ODCs will be estimated for each TO. Profit/fee is unal-

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

lowable on ODCs. The cumulative extended total of all labor categories ordered plus ODCs will define the TO ceiling price. The government will not reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred beyond the ceiling price, for hours not delivered, for hours delivered but in excess of the quantities ordered for a particular labor category or for ODCs exceeding authorized amounts. For hours ordered but not delivered, the Government may issue a unilateral modification to the order that reduces the price of the order and de-obligates funds from the order in proportion to the number of hours ordered but not delivered. The contractor is not permitted to adjust T&M labor hours among categories after award within the overall NTE of the order, unless approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. B.4.1.3 Cost Reimbursement Pricing
All TOs issued on a Cost Reimbursement basis will be priced in accordance with the rates established in Section B.5. The government reserves the right to negotiation lower rates to ensure that they comply with requirements in table 15-2 in FAR 15.408 and are in accordance with any approved Defense Contract Audit Agency/Defense Contract Management Agency rates. These rates include all applicable direct and indirect rates estimates building up to the total cost.

If the TO type is to be Cost-Plus Award Fee (CPAF), the fixed portion of fee and the award portion will be clearly differentiated. Payment from the award fee pool will be based on the standards and procedures outlined in Section I.7, Determination of Award Fee, Section I.8, Performance Evaluation Plan and I.9, Distribution of Award Fee. Un-awarded fees shall not be rolled over into another performance period.

B.5 Loaded Labor Rates Tables The Loaded Labor Rates Tables provide labor category descriptions, labor rates, and travel (ODCs) for performance of the requirements as specified in individual Orders. Fully loaded hourly labor rates are included for each labor category both at the Contractor site and at Government sites. These fullyloaded hourly labor rates are the maximum rates allowable for Prime Contractors and Subcontractors. These rates will be used for Firm Fixed Price, Time & Material and Cost Reimbursable task orders. The contractor's labor categories shall include labor qualifications that describe required experience, certification and education. The contractor shall certify on each submitted invoice that individuals billing against a particular labor category meet the associated qualification requirements.

Introduction
Purpose In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, a full and open competition will be sought to establish a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to support the Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing (TTAC) Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) Program. A single award is in the best interest of the Government. The contract requires the Contractor to work with the TIM Program in the planning, development, and implementation of the TIM system. This is accomplished by issuing Task Orders against the IDIQ contract. The task orders, while stand-alone orders, are inter-related working towards the TIM, TSA and DHS mission. Background The mission of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is to protect the nation's transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce. TSA's Office of Transportation Threat Assessment and Credentialing TTAC's mission is to reduce the probability of a successful terrorist or other criminal attack to the transportation system through application of the threat assessment methodologies that are intended to identify known or suspected terrorist or other threats working on or seeking access to the Nation's transportation system. TTAC serves as the lead for all security threat assessments and credentialing initiatives for transportation industry workers, individuals seeking access to critical infrastructure, and travelers. In support of its mission, TTAC needs to provide the following capabilities: ˇ Provides security threat assessments for various populations traveling into, out of, or within the United States to identify terrorist or other threats to the transportation and critical infrastructure sectors. ˇ Provides enrollment and credentialing services, used by an individual, to gain unescorted access to special, sterile and/or secure areas after successfully completing a security threat assessment. ˇ Offers screening services to support eligibility for unescorted access to special, sterile and/or secure areas where credentials may not be provided or required. ˇ Conducts recurrent vetting (checks daily) on over 20 million individuals against the consolidated federal watch list and other derogatory data sets. ˇ Engages a wide range of transportation stakeholders, requiring secure credentials, to address current and emerging threats to the transportation industry. ˇ Performs end-to-end program management for aviation, maritime, and surface programs with core capabilities in enrollment services, vetting operations, adjudication and credential management. The current TTAC security threat assessment infrastructure was not built as an integrated set of capabilities to support multiple programs. The current TTAC vetting and credentialing services are limited by aging and stove piped information resource management processes and tools. The current TTAC vetting and credentialing enterprise architecture was created to support 2.5 million individuals per year. Today, the populations supported by TTAC have increased to 12.5 million individuals per year. The expected serviced populations are to grow to 20 million individuals within the next two years and a projected 40 to 50 million increases within the next five years. As a result, TTAC must modernize its current infrastructure to meet the TSA mission capabilities and be scalable to meet the mission needs of current and future populations.

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

In addition to the increase in the number of requests, it is further anticipated that after five years, existing stove-piped business processes and information systems will need to be reengineered or replaced by a new integrated business architecture that will do the following: consolidate multiple enrollment methods, implement identity management services across programs, standardize the approach for customer relationship management, move to a person-centric view, standardize the physical and virtual credentialing processes, standardize threat assessment processes, standardize STA notification and verification activities, and consolidate operations by integrating program-specific Information Technology (IT) systems and business processes into a common secure vetting, adjudication and credentialing architecture and fully integrated system.

SECTION D- PACKAGING AND MARKING
D.1 Sensitive Information Packaging and Marking All items shall be delivered in accordance with Section D of the contract unless otherwise specified in the individual Orders. Page Marking Prominently mark the bottom of the front cover, first page, title page, back cover and each individual page containing FOUO information with the caveat "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY." Deliverables All deliverables submitted to the Contracting Officer, the Program Manager, the COTR, the TO Program Manager, the TO Contracting Officer or the TO COTR shall be accompanied by a packing list or other suitable shipping document that shall clearly indicate the following: (a) Contract number; (b) Order number; (c) Name and address of the consignor; (d) Name and address of the consignee; (e) Government bill of lading number covering the shipment (if any); and (f) Description of the item/material shipped, including item number, quantity, number of containers, and package number (if any). (g) Specific marking requirements may be addressed in individual TOs. Specific FOUO Types Materials containing specific types of FOUO may be further marked with the applicable caveat, e.g., "LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE," in order to alert the reader of the type of information conveyed. Where the sensitivity of the information warrants additional access and dissemination restrictions, the originator may cite additional access and dissemination restrictions. For example: WARNING: This document is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). It is to be controlled, stored, handled, transmitted, distributed, and disposed of in accordance with DHS policy relating to FOUO information. This information shall not be distributed beyond the original addressees without prior authorization of the originator. FOUO Transmittal Outside of DHS Materials being transmitted to recipients outside of DHS, for example, other federal agencies, state or local officials, etc. who may not be aware of what the FOUO caveat represents, shall include the following additional notice:

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 32 of 126

WARNING: This document is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). It contains information that may be exempt from public release under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552). It is to be controlled, stored, handled, transmitted, distributed, and disposed of in accordance with DHS policy relating to FOUO information and is not to be released to the public or other personnel who do not have a valid "need-to-know" without prior approval of an authorized DHS official. Computer Storage Media Computer storage media, i.e., disks, tapes, removable drives, etc., containing FOUO information will be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY." Classified Documents Containing FOUO Portions of a classified document, i.e., subjects, titles, paragraphs, and subparagraphs that contain only FOUO information will be marked with the abbreviation (FOUO). Individual portion markings on a document that contains no other designation are not required. Designator or originator information and markings, downgrading instructions, and date/event markings are not required. General Handling Procedures Although FOUO is the DHS standard caveat for identifying sensitive unclassified information, some types of FOUO information may be more sensitive than others and thus warrant additional safeguarding measures beyond the minimum requirements established in this manual. For example, certain types of information may be considered extremely sensitive based on the repercussions that could result should the information be released or compromised. Such repercussions could be the loss of life or compromise of an informant or operation. Additional control requirements may be added as necessary to afford appropriate protection to the information. DHS employees, contractors, and detailees must use sound judgment coupled with an evaluation of the risks, vulnerabilities, and the potential damage to personnel or property as the basis for determining the need for safeguards in excess of the minimum requirements and protect the information accordingly. FOUO Coversheet Usage When removed from an authorized storage location and persons without a need-to-know are present, or where casual observation would reveal FOUO information to unauthorized persons, a "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" cover sheet will be used to prevent unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure.

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 33 of 126

Transmitting FOUO When forwarding FOUO information, a FOUO cover sheet should be placed on top of the transmittal letter, memorandum or document. Receiving Non-DHS and Non-TSA FOUO When receiving FOUO equivalent information from another government agency, handle in accordance with the guidance provided by the other government agency. Where no guidance is provided, handle in accordance with the requirements of this contract. D.2 Requirements for Marking Sensitive Security Information (SSI) This section contains requirements for Protective Marking and Limited Distribution Statement for Sensitive Security Information (SSI). Protective Marking. The protective marking consisting of the words "SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION" must be applied to all documents that contain SSI. This marking should be written or stamped in plain bold type (Times New Roman) with a font size of 12 or an equivalent style and font size. Distribution Limitation Statement The distribution statement must be applied to all documents that contain SSI. This statement should be written or stamped in plain bold type, Times New Roman and a font size of 8 or an equivalent style and font size. Any documents referencing Security Sensitive Information as defined in 49 CFR Part 1520 must contain the following distribution limitation statement: "WARNING: This document contains SSI controlled under 49 CFR Part 1520. No part of this document may be released without the written permission of the Assistant Secretary of the Transportation Security, Arlington, VA. Unauthorized release may result in civil penalty (5 U.S.C 552)." D.3 Sensitive Information Handling The Contractor shall protect DHS sensitive information and all Government provided and contractor-owned IT systems used to store or process DHS sensitive information. The Contractor shall adhere to the following requirements for handling sensitive information: (a) Media Protection. The Contractor shall ensure that all hardcopy and electronic media (including backup and removable media) that contain DHS sensitive information are appropriately marked and secured when not in use. Any sensitive

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 34 of 126

information stored on media to be surplused, transferred to another individual, or returned to the manufacturer shall be purged from the media before disposal. Disposal shall be performed using DHS approved sanitization methods. The Contractor shall establish and implement procedures to ensure sensitive information cannot be accessed or stolen. These procedures shall address the handling and protection of paper and electronic outputs from systems (computers, printers, faxes, and copiers) and the transportation and mailing of sensitive media. (See TSA 1400.3, Chapter 3, Section 19 ­ Information Classification, Control and Disclosure) (b) Access Control. The Contractor shall control user access to DHS sensitive information based on positive user identification and authentication mechanisms. Access control measures employed shall provide protection from unauthorized alteration, loss, unavailability, or disclosure of information. The Contractor shall ensure its personnel are granted the most restrictive set of access privileges needed for performance of authorized tasks. The Contractor shall divide and separate duties and responsibilities of critical IT functions to different individuals so that no individual has all necessary authority or systems access privileges needed to disrupt or corrupt a critical process. (See TSA 1400.3, Chapter 4, Sections 2 ­ Network Access Control, and 3 ­ Remote Access) (c) Auditing. The Contractor shall ensure that its contractor-owned IT systems used to store or process DHS sensitive information maintain an audit trail sufficient to reconstruct security relevant events. Audit trails shall include the identity of each person and device accessing or attempting to access the system, the time and date of the access and the log-off time, activities that might modify, bypass, or negate security safeguards, and security-relevant actions associated with processing. The Contractor shall periodically review audit logs and ensure that audit trails are protected from modification, authorized access, or destruction and are retained and regularly backed up. (See TSA 1400.3, Chapter 4, Sections 10 ­ Security Audit Trails) (d) Network Security. The Contractor shall monitor its networks for security events and employ intrusion detection systems capable of detecting inappropriate, incorrect, or malicious activity. Any interconnections between contractor-owned IT systems that process or store DHS sensitive information and IT systems not controlled by DHS shall be established through controlled interfaces and documented through formal interconnection security agreements. The Contractor shall employ boundary protection devices to enforce access control between networks, including Internet and extranet access. The Contractor shall ensure its email systems are secure, properly configured, and that network protection mechanisms implemented. The Contractor shall conduct periodic vulnerability assessments and tests on its IT systems containing DHS sensitive information to identify security vulnerabilities. (See TSA 1400.3, Chapter 4, Sections 5 ­ Wide Area Network (WAN) Security, and 6 ­ Local Area Network (LAN) Security) (e) Rules of Behavior. The Contractor shall develop and enforce Rules of Behavior for contractor-owned IT systems that process or store DHS sensitive infor-

A suitability determination involves the following three phases: Phase 1: Enter On Duty Suitability Determination: a review of a contractor employee's consumer credit report, criminal history records, and submitted security forms to determine, to the extent possible, if the contractor employee has bad debt and/or criminal offenses and/or falsification issues that would prohibit employment as a TSA contractor. This determination will include verification of citizenship for contractor employees born outside of the United States. A favorable Enter On Duty Suitability Determination is not a final suitability determination; rather, it is a preliminary review of external data sources that allows the contractor employee to commence work prior to the required background investigation being completed. When a contractor employee is deemed suitable to commence work on a TSA contract, TSA PerSec will notify the appropriate Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) of the favorable determination. Similar notifications will be sent when a contractor employee has not passed the preliminary background check and has been deemed unsuitable. Phase 2: Background Investigation: Once the contractor employee commences work on a TSA contract, TSA PerSec will process all submitted security forms to determine whether the contractor has previously been the subject of a federal background investigation sufficient in scope to meet TSA minimum investigative requirements. Contractor employees who have a federal investigation sufficient in scope will immediately be processed for final suitability adjudication. Those contractor employees who do not have a previous federal background investigation

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 56 of 126

sufficient in scope will be scheduled for the appropriate level background investigation through the submission of their security forms to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Phase 3: Final Suitability Adjudication: TSA PerSec will complete the final suitability determination after receipt, review, and adjudication of the completed OPM background investigation. The final suitability determination is an assessment made by TSA PerSec to determine whether there is reasonable expectation that the continued employment of the TSA contractor will or will not protect or promote the efficiency of the agency. An unfavorable final suitability determination will result in a notification to the COTR that the contractor employee has been deemed unsuitable for continued contract employment and that he/she shall be removed from the TSA contract. H.15 PROHIBITION OF INDIVIDUALS The Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to prohibit individuals from working on the contract if the government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to, carelessness, insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns.

H.16 CONTRACT PERSONNEL SECURITY CLEARANCES Staff for use on these efforts must be capable of being granted a security clearance for access to classified information and/or IT resources appropriate for the level of classification associated with the work they are to perform. Contractor personnel will be required to submit documentation, including appropriate credentialing, for access to TSA workplaces through the Security Office in order to facilitate their unencumbered entrance to appropriate TSA facilities. H.16.1 Minimum Security Clearances Resources engaged in systems analysis, architecture development, programming, systems administration, and hands-on application development involving actual data must be cleared at the minimum security level of Secret, or Interim Secret. Administrative staff not directly involved in supporting these efforts need not possess a Secret-level clearance, but must have a favorably-determined employment suitability check. H.16.2 Future Orders Future task orders issued under this contract may require higher clearance levels such as Top Secret (TS) or Top Secret with Sensitive Compartmented Information designation (TS/SCI). When and if such future task orders are designed and awarded, required clearance levels will be specified, and the requisite DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, will be initiated.

H.16.3 Government Approval of Contractor Staff Personnel Clearances The Government reserves the right to determine those efforts requiring security clearances and specific staff to be cleared; the Government must approve proposed staff requiring clearances before such staff members are used on the contract. The Government expects that the Contractor will use existing, cleared resources, appropriate for the clearance level required, to accomplish the work contained herein. Furthermore, vendors shall not include in their price proposals any fees incurred prior to this effort for obtaining clearances for staff currently employed by the vendor. H.17 PHYSICAL SECURITY The Contractor shall ensure that access to Contractor buildings, rooms, work areas and spaces, and structures that house DHS sensitive information or IT systems through which DHS sensitive information can be accessed, is limited to authorized personnel. The Contractor shall ensure that controls are implemented to deter, detect, monitor, restrict, and regulate access to controlled areas at all times. Controls shall be sufficient to safeguard IT assets and DHS sensitive information against loss, theft, destruction, accidental damage, hazardous conditions, fire, malicious actions, and natural disasters. Physical security controls shall be implemented in accordance with the policy and guidance contained in DHS MD4300.Pub, Volume II, Part A, IT Security Program Handbook for Sensitive Systems; Sources: ˇ DHS MD4300.Pub, Volume I, Part A, Policy Guide for Sensitive Systems, para 3.2, Contractors and Outsourced Operations (2nd and 3rd policy statements); para 4.2.1, General Physical Access DHS MD11050.1, Physical Protection of Facilities and Real Property

partment of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager or his/her designee). The IT Security office currently has a representative engineer who attends CIP meetings; (2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, "Policies and Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of SSI," as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or his/her designee). The IT Security Office currently has an SSI Officer actively engaged in SSI related issues/concerns; (3) "For Official Use Only (FOUO)" is unclassified information of a sensitive nature, and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, individual privacy under 5 U.S.C. section 552a or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and if provided by the Government to the contractor, is marked in such a way as to place a reasonable person on notice of its sensitive nature. (4) "Information Technology Resources" include, but are not limited to, computer equipment, networking equipment, telecommunications equipment, cabling, network drives, computer drives, network software, computer software, software programs, intranet sites, and internet sites.
H.18.2 Disclosure of Information ­Official Use Only

Any TSA Information made available or to which access is provided, and which is marked or should be marked "Official Use Only", shall be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and shall not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract. Disclosure to anyone other than an officer or employee of the contractor or subcontractor at any tier shall require prior written approval of the TSA. Requests to make such disclosure should be addressed to the TSA contracting officer.
H.18.3 Notification of Proper Use and Penalties for Misusing "Official Use Only" Information

Each officer or employee of the contractor or subcontractor at any tier to whom "Official Use Only" information may be made available or disclosed shall be notified in writing by the contractor that "Official Use Only" information disclosed to such officer or employee can be used only for the purpose and to the extent authorized herein, and that further disclosure of any such "Official Use Only" information, by any means, for a purpose or to an extent unauthorized herein, may subject the offender to criminal sanctions imposed by 18 U.S.C. Sections 641 and 3571. Section 641 of 18 U.S.C. provides, in pertinent part, that whoever knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or without authority sells, conveys, or disposes of any record of the United States or whoever receives the same with the intent to convert it to his use or gain, knowing it to have been converted, shall be guilty of a crime punishable by a fine or imprisoned up to 10 years or both.

H.18.4 Disclosure of Technology to Non-Immigrant Alien

Disclosure of source code, technology, or documentation to a nonimmigrant alien, a type of foreign national not authorized access may be considered to be an export and export control violation by TSA. The contractor shall at all time comply with Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. parts 120 through 130, and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 C.F.R. parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In complying with these export provisions, the contractor shall determine the applicability of license exemptions; exceptions and obtain appropriate licenses or other approvals for exports of source code, technology, and documentation. The contractor shall make the same determinations where its use of non-immigrant aliens would allow them access to export sensitive information. Acquisitions involving foreign nationals or foreign entities are subject to the following provisions:
H.18.5 Use of Non-Immigrant Aliens and Non-US Companies

The contractor shall submit an explanation to the TSA contracting officer of why use of the nonimmigrant alien would not violate export restrictions. The contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the license and license exemption or exception. Copies of export related determinations and documentation shall be provided to TSA upon request. For export or security reasons, TSA reserves the right to exclude Offerors with a controlling degree of non U.S. ownership, and non U.S. place of business or nonimmigrant aliens from being given access to software, equipment, technology or documentation necessary to prepare an offer or to perform the contract. Offerors should be aware that obtaining an export clearance license may still be outweighed by security concerns. Any potential Offeror either having or intending to make significant use of, non US companies or personnel that are nonimmigrant aliens is encourage to consult the TSA contracting officer prior to committing resources. This clause shall flow down to subcontractors. H.19 SECURITY OF SYSTEMS HANDLING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND PRIVACY INCIDENT REPONSE (Nov 2010) (a) Definitions. "Breach" (may be used interchangeably with "Privacy Incident') as used in this clause means the loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or any similar situation where persons other than authorized users, and for other than authorized purpose, have access or potential access to Personally Identifiable Information, in usable form whether physical or electronic. "Personally Identifiable Information (PII)" as used in this clause means any information that permits the identity of an individual to be directly or indirectly inferred, including any other information that is linked or linkable to that individual regardless of whether the individual is a citizen of the United States, legal permanent resident, or a visitor to the United States.

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 60 of 126

Examples of PII include: name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number, Social Security Number (SSN), email address, zip code, account numbers, certificate/license numbers, vehicle identifiers including license plates, uniform resource locators (URLs), Internet protocol addresses, biometric identifiers (e.g., fingerprints), photographic facial images, or any other unique identifying number or characteristic, and any information where it is reasonably foreseeable that the information will be linked with other information to identify the individual. "Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (Sensitive PII)" as used in this clause is a subset of Personally Identifiable Information, which if lost, compromised or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. , Complete social security numbers (SSN), alien registration numbers (A-number) and biometric identifiers (such as fingerprint, voiceprint, or iris scan) are considered Sensitive PII even if they are not coupled with additional PII. Additional examples include any groupings of information that contains an individual's name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements: (1) Driver's license number, passport number, or truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits) (2) Date of birth (month, day, and year) (3) Citizenship or immigration status (4) Financial information such as account numbers or Electronic Funds Transfer Information (5) Medical Information (6) System authentication information such as mother's maiden name, account passwords or personal identification numbers (PIN) Other Personally Identifiable information may be "sensitive" depending on its context, such as a list of employees with less than satisfactory performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number. In contrast, a business card or public telephone directory of agency employees contains Personally Identifiable Information but it is not sensitive. (b) Systems Access. Work to be performed under this contract requires the handling of Sensitive PII. The contractor shall provide the Government access to, and information regarding systems the contractor operates on behalf of the Government under this contract, when requested by the Government, as part of its responsibility to ensure compliance with security requirements, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Government in assuring compliance with such requirements. Government access shall include independent validation testing of controls, system penetration testing by the Government, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) data reviews, and access by agency Inspectors General for its reviews. (c) Systems Security. In performing its duties related to management, operation, and/or access of systems containing Sensitive PII under this contract, the contractor, its employees and subcontractors shall comply with applicable security requirements described in DHS Sensitive System Publication 4300A or any replacement publication and rules of conduct as described in TSA MD 3700.4

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

In addition, use of contractor-owned laptops or other media storage devices to process or store PII is prohibited under this contract until the contractor provides, and the contracting officer in coordination with CISO approves written certification by the contractor that the following requirements are met: (1) Laptops employ encryption using a NIST Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 or successor approved product; (2) The contractor has developed and implemented a process to ensure that security and other applications software are kept current; (3) Mobile computing devices utilize anti-viral software and a host-based firewall mechanism; (4) When no longer needed, all removable media and laptop hard drives shall be processed (i.e., sanitized, degaussed, or destroyed) in accordance with DHS security requirements. (5) The contractor shall maintain an accurate inventory of devices used in the performance of this contract; (6) Contractor employee annual training and rules of conduct/behavior shall be developed, conducted/issued, and acknowledged by employees in writing. Training and rules of conduct shall address at minimum: (i) Authorized and official use; (ii) Prohibition against use of personally-owned equipment to process, access, or store Sensitive PII; (iii) Prohibition against access by unauthorized users and unauthorized use by authorized users; and (iv) Protection of Sensitive PII; (7) All Sensitive PII obtained under this contract shall be removed from contractor-owned information technology assets upon termination or expiration of contractor work. Removal must be accomplished in accordance with DHS Sensitive System Publication 4300A, which the contracting officer will provide upon request. Certification of data removal will be performed by the contractor's Project Manager and written notification confirming certification will be delivered to the contracting officer within 15 days of termination/expiration of contractor work.

(d) Data Security. Contractor shall limit access to the data covered by this clause to those employees and subcontractors who require the information in order to perform their official duties under this contract. The contractor, contractor employees, and subcontractors must physically secure Sensitive PII when not in use and/or under the control of an authorized individual, and

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 62 of 126

when in transit to prevent unauthorized access or loss. When Sensitive PII is no longer needed or required to be retained under applicable Government records retention policies, it must be destroyed through means that will make the Sensitive PII irretrievable. The contractor shall only use Sensitive PII obtained under this contract for purposes of the contract, and shall not collect or use such information for any other purpose without the prior written approval of the contracting officer. At expiration or termination of this contract, the contractor shall turn over all Sensitive PII obtained under the contract that is in its possession to the Government. (e) Breach Response. The contractor agrees that in the event of any actual or suspected breach of Sensitive PII (i.e., loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, access for an unauthorized purpose, or other unauthorized access, whether physical or electronic), it shall immediately, and in no event later than one hour of discovery, report the breach to the contracting officer, the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), and the TSA Director of Privacy Policy & Compliance (TSAprivacy@dhs.gov). The contractor is responsible for positively verifying that notification is received and acknowledged by at least one of the foregoing Government parties. (f) Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement. The contractor has in place procedures and the capability to promptly notify any individual whose Sensitive PII was, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached, as determined appropriate. The method and content of any notification by the contractor shall be coordinated with, and subject to the prior approval of the Government, based upon a risk-based analysis conducted by the Government in accordance with DHS Privacy incident Handling Guidance. Notification shall not proceed unless the Government has determined that: (1) notification is appropriate; and (2) would not impede a law enforcement investigation or jeopardize national security. Subject to Government analysis of the breach and the terms of its instructions to the contractor regarding any resulting breach notification, a method of notification may include letters to affected individuals sent by first class mail, electronic means, or general public notice, as approved by the Government. At minimum, a notification should include: (1) a brief description of how the breach occurred; (2) a description of the types of personal information involved in the breach; (3) a statement as to whether the information was encrypted or protected by other means; (4) steps an individual may take to protect themselves; (5) what the agency is doing, if anything, to investigate the breach, to mitigate losses, and to protect against any further breaches; and (6) point of contact information identifying who affected individuals may contact for further information. In the event that a Sensitive PII breach occurs as a result of the violation of a term of this contract by the contractor or its employees, the contractor shall, as directed by the contracting officer and at no cost to the Government, take timely action to correct or mitigate the violation, which may include providing notification and/or other identity protection services to affected individuals for a period not to exceed 12 months from discovery of the breach. Should the Government

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 63 of 126

elect to provide and/or procure notification or identity protection services in response to a breach, the contractor will be responsible for reimbursing the Government for those expenses. (g) Pass-Through of Security Requirements to Subcontractors. The contractor agrees to incorporate the substance of this clause, its terms and requirements, in all subcontracts under this contract, and to require written subcontractor acknowledgement of same. Violation by a subcontractor of any provision set forth in this clause will be attributed to the contractor.

(b) The Contractor shall require that all employees and consultants who are given access to such information sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure statement agreeing to safeguard the confidentiality of all such information gathered or provided to them hereunder as an integral condition of their employment. (c) Upon the Government's request, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer with plans and procedures to ensure the confidentiality and physical security of information gathered or provided hereunder. (d) The Contractor may "gather and analyze" information that is not furnished or owned by the Government. Such information will not be subject to the restrictions in this clause. H.21.2 Confidentiality of Data and Information (a) In the performance of this order, the Contractor, its consultants and or subcontractors, may need access to information in the Government's possession which is encumbered with restrictions on the Government's rights to use or disclose, or that might preclude dissemination or use other than in the performance of this contract. By reason of the foregoing, the Contractor agrees that any employee, subcontractor or consultant it uses shall comply with all restrictive legends or markings on data, software, or information it uses, and further agrees not to: (1) Knowingly disclose such data or information to others without prior written authorization from the Contracting Officer, unless that data or information has otherwise become available to the public through no action or fault of the Contractor; and (2) Use for any purpose other than the performance of this Contract data bearing a restrictive marking or legend, unless such information or data has otherwise fallen into public domain through no action or fault of the Contractor. (3) If work required to be performed under this Contract requires access to proprietary data of other companies, the Contractor shall use its best efforts to obtain an agreement from such other companies for such use unless such data is provided or made available to the Contractor by the Government. Two copies of any such company-to-company agreements so entered into shall be furnished promptly to the Contracting Officer. Company-to-Company agreements shall prescribe the scope of authorized use of disclosure, and other terms and conditions agreed upon between the parties.

TSA Management Directive No. 2800.5, "Foreign Travel Briefing and Contact Reporting Requirements." TSA Management Directive No. 2800.8, "Information Security (INFOSEC) Program."

H.21.4 Security Policies and Directives The Contractor is required to comply with all Government security law, policies, directives, and procedures including, but not limited to:  Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  NIST Series 800  Security-related DHS and TSA Management Directives  System-specific security requirements  Application-specific security requirements Vendors will be responsible for identifying, evaluating, and proposing appropriately qualified staff for their respective work packages.

The TSA information security policy is an operational implementation and extension of the DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A. DHS 4300A provides general policy in a wide variety of areas and provides guidance to DHS Organizational Elements (OEs) for the establishment of operational policy within the OEs. DHS 4300A takes precedence in instances where there is conflict between it and TSA MD 1400.3 that is not otherwise resolved by TSA MD 1400.3, Attachment 1, Security Policy ­ DHS Bridge. Note that the TSA MD 1400.3 addresses additional details relating to security policies, personnel security, data encryption, and more. The Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR) serves as a supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The OCIO/OCISO/IT Security Office currently complies with FAR and HSAR related statements, to include "Contractor Employee Access". In addition to the above referenced HSAR document, the "TSA MD 2800.71 - Pre-employment Investigation Standard for TSA Employees and Contractors" document also references and addresses:  SSI  FOUO  Sensitive Information  Information Technology Resources,  Background checks/analysis and administrative processes together with CO, COTR and CSO,

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

 Sensitive information training, computer access agreement (CAA) and security orientation briefing (are performed by the IT Security's Security Awareness, Training and Education Program) for prime or subcontractors,  Employee Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) which is kept on file at IT Security, and  Specific site/building/floor access (as arranged by the COTR and Training Coordinator). DHS MD 11042 (date 5/11/04), Safeguarding Sensitive But Unclassified (FOUO) Information and 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1520.5, addresses HSAR-related information for which the OCISO is in compliant as well. The TSA FISMA dashboard scores (Green) and the judgment of the DHS Inspector General attest to our compliance with Public Law and appropriate Executive Orders. HSAR 3052.204-71 - CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE ACCESS (JUN 2006) (a) Sensitive Information, as used in this Chapter, means any information, the loss, misuse, disclosure, or unauthorized access to or modification of which could adversely affect the national or homeland security interest, or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under section 552a of title 5, United States Code (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense, homeland security or foreign policy. This definition includes the following categories of information: (1) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 29) as amended, the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager or his/her designee); (2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, "Policies and Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of SSI," as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or his/her designee); (3) Information designated as "For Official Use Only," which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and (4) Any information that is designated "sensitive" or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures.

Therefore, the Contractor shall not disclose, orally or in writing, any sensitive information to any person unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. For those contractor employees authorized access to sensitive information, the contractor shall ensure that these persons receive training concerning the protection and disclosure of sensitive information both during and after contract performance. (f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts at any tier where the subcontractor may have access to Government facilities, sensitive information, or resources. ALTERNATE I (JUN 2006) (g) Before receiving access to IT resources under this contract the individual must receive a security briefing, which the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will arrange, and complete any nondisclosure agreement furnished by DHS. (h) The contractor shall have access only to those areas of DHS information technology resources explicitly stated in this contract or approved by the COTR in writing as necessary for performance of the work under this contract. Any attempts by contractor personnel to gain access to any information technology resources not expressly authorized by the statement of work, other terms and conditions in this contract, or as approved in writing by the COTR, is strictly prohibited. In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate actions with regard to the contract and the individual(s) involved. (i) Contractor access to DHS networks from a remote location is a temporary privilege for mutual convenience while the contractor performs business for the DHS Component. It is not a

(e) The award fee authority fee authority shall determine whether a security or privacy breach is categorized as a major security or privacy breach. To ensure that any potential final award fee evaluation at contract completion reflects any breach of privacy or security, in an interim period, the overall award fee pool shall be reduced by the amount of the fee available for the period in which the major breach occurred if a zero fee determination was made because of a major breach of privacy or security. H.21.6 Disposition of Government Property Thirty (30) calendar days prior to the end of the TO period of performance, or upon termination of the contract, the Contractor shall furnish to the TO COTR a complete inventory of all Government Property in its possession under the TO that has not been tested to destruction, completely expended in performance, or incorporated and made a part of a deliverable end item.

H.22 MAJOR BREACH OF SAFETY OR SECURITY H.22.1 Safety Breach Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Safety is essential to TSA and is a material part of this contract. A major breach of safety may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this contract, including termination for default. A major breach of safety must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of safety is an act or omission of the Contractor that consists of an accident, incident, or exposure resulting in a fatality or mission failure; or in damage to equipment or property equal to or greater than $1 million; or in any "willful" or "repeat" violation cited by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or by a state agency operating under an OSHA approved plan. H.22.2 Security Breach Security is the condition of safeguarding against espionage, sabotage, crime (including computer crime), or attack. A major breach of security may constitute a breach of contract that entitles the Government to exercise any of its rights and remedies applicable to material parts of this contract, including termination for default. A major breach of security may occur on or off Government installations, but must be related directly to the work on the contract. A major breach of security is an act or omission by the Contractor that results in compromise of classified information, illegal technology transfer, workplace violence resulting in criminal conviction, sabotage, compromise or denial of information technology services, equipment or property damage from vandalism greater than $250,000, or theft greater than $250,000.

If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a contractor's commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage. Employer's liability coverage of at least $100,000 shall be required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers' compensation to be written by private carriers. General Liability ˇ Bodily Injury Liability The Contracting Officer shall require bodily injury liability insurance coverage written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $500,000 per occurrence.

Section 508 Applicable Exceptions Exceptions for this work statement have been determined by DHS and only the exceptions described herein may be applied. Any request for additional exceptions shall be sent to the COTR and determination will be made in accordance with DHS MD 4010.2. DHS has identified the following exceptions that may apply: 36 CFR 1194.3(b) Incidental to Contract, all EIT that is exclusively owned and used by the contractor to fulfill this work statement does not require compliance with Section 508. This exception does not apply to any EIT deliverable, service or item that will be used by any Federal employee(s) or member(s) of the public. This exception only applies to those contractors assigned to fulfill the obligations of this work statement and for the purposes of this requirement, are not considered members of the public. Section 508 Compliance Requirements 36 CFR 1194.2(b) (COTS/GOTS products), When procuring a product, each agency shall procure products which comply with the provisions in this part when such products are available in the commercial marketplace or when such products are developed in response to a Government solicitation. Agencies cannot claim a product as a whole is not commercially available because no product in the marketplace meets all the standards. If products are commercially available that meets some but not all of the standards, the agency must procure the product that best meets the standards. When applying this standard, all procurements of EIT shall have documentation of market research that identify a list of products or services that first meet the agency business needs, and from that list of products or services, an analysis that the selected product met more of the accessibility requirements than the non-selected products as required by FAR 39.2.

tracting Officer under the task order. Upon the Contracting Officer's request, the Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted, or subject to other investigations as required. All contractor employees requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information or IT resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on the task order unless the requirement is waived under Departmental procedures. (d) The Task Order Contracting Officer may require the contractor to prohibit individuals from working on the task order if the government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to carelessness, insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns. (e) Work under the task order may involve access to sensitive information. Therefore, the Contractor shall not disclose, orally or in writing, any sensitive information to any person unless authorized access to sensitive information, the contractor shall ensure that these persons receive training concerning the protection and disclosure of sensitive information both during and after task order performance.

Limitation of Future Contracting (HSAR 3052.209-73) (JUN 2006) (a) The Contracting Officer has determined that this acquisition may give rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest. Accordingly, the attention of prospective Offerors is invited to FAR Subpart 9.5 - Organizational Conflicts of Interest.

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 85 of 126

(b) The nature of this conflict is: (1) When either the Prime contractor, core team member(s) and/or subcontractor (a) has access to procurement sensitive information that may provide it an unfair advantage in competing for some or all of the proposed effort; or (b) drafts or recommends specifications or statements of work or substantially complete statements of work; (2) the contractor reviews the work of itself or any affiliates; or (3) offers advice or planning in areas in which the contractor or any affiliates have financial interests tied to particular solutions. (c) The restrictions upon future contracting are as follows: (1) If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through the performance of tasks pursuant to this contract, is required to develop specifications or statements of work that are to be incorporated into a solicitation, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described in that solicitation as a prime or firsttier subcontractor under an ensuing DHS contract. This restriction shall remain in effect for a reasonable time, as agreed to by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor, sufficient to avoid unfair competitive advantage or potential bias (this time shall in no case be less than the duration of the initial production contract). DHS shall not unilaterally require the Contractor to prepare such specifications or statements of work under this contract. (2) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary, business confidential, or financial data of other companies, and as long as these data remain proprietary or confidential, the Contractor shall protect these data from unauthorized use and disclosure and agrees not to use them to compete with those other companies.

Notification of Ownership Changes (FAR 52.215-19) (OCT 1997) (a) The Contractor shall make the following notifications in writing: (1) When the Contractor becomes aware that a change in its ownership has occurred, or is certain to occur, that could result in changes in the valuation of its capitalized assets in the accounting records, the Contractor shall notify the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) within 30 calendar days. (2) The Contractor shall also notify the ACO within 30 calendar days whenever changes to asset valuations or any other cost changes have occurred or are certain to occur as a result of a change in ownership.

Page 86 of 126

(1) Maintain current, accurate, and complete inventory records of assets and their costs; (2) Provide the ACO or designated representative ready access to the records upon request; (3) Ensure that all individual and grouped assets, their capitalized values, accumulated depreciation or amortization, and remaining useful lives are identified accurately before and after each of the Contractor's ownership changes; and (4) Retain and continue to maintain depreciation and amortization schedules based on the asset records maintained before each Contractor ownership change. (c) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts under this contract that meet the applicability requirement of FAR 15.408(k). 52.216-10 Incentive Fee.(Mar 1997) (For Incentive Fee Task Orders Only-If Applicable. Fill-ins will be completed on each task order) (a) General. The Government shall pay the Contractor for performing this contract a fee determined as provided in this contract. (b) Target cost and target fee. The target cost and target fee specified in the Schedule are subject to adjustment if the contract is modified in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause.

(2) "Target fee," as used in this contract, means the fee initially negotiated on the assumption that this contract would be performed for a cost equal to the estimated cost initially negotiated, adjusted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause. (c) Withholding of payment. Normally, the Government shall pay the fee to the Contractor as specified in the Schedule. However, when the Contracting Officer considers that performance or cost indicates that the Contractor will not achieve target, the Government shall pay on the basis of an appropriate lesser fee. When the Contractor demonstrates that performance or cost clearly indicates that the Contractor will earn a fee significantly above the target fee, the Government may, at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, pay on the basis of an appropriate higher fee. After payment of 85 percent of the applicable fee, the Contracting Officer may withhold further payment of fee until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to protect the Government's interest. This reserve shall not exceed 15 percent of the applicable fee or $100,000, whichever is less. The Contracting Officer shall release 75 percent of all fee withholds under this contract after receipt of the certified final indirect cost rate proposal covering the year of physical completion of this contract, provided the Contractor

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 87 of 126

has satisfied all other contract terms and conditions, including the submission of the final patent and royalty reports, and is not delinquent in submitting final vouchers on prior years' settlements. The Contracting Officer may release up to 90 percent of the fee withholds under this contract based on the Contractor's past performance related to the submission and settlement of final indirect cost rate proposals. (d) Equitable adjustments.

(e) Fee payable. (1) The fee payable under this contract shall be the target fee increased by _____ [Contracting Officer insert Contractor's participation] cents for every dollar that the total allowable cost is less than the target cost or decreased by ______ [Contracting Officer insert Contractor's participation] cents for every dollar that the total allowable cost exceeds the target cost. In no event shall the fee be greater than ____________ [Contracting Officer insert percentage] percent or less than _________________ [Contracting Officer insert percentage] percent of the target cost. (2) The fee shall be subject to adjustment, to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this clause, and within the minimum and maximum fee limitations in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause, when the total allowable cost is increased or decreased as a consequence of-- (i) Payments made under assignments; or (ii) Claims excepted from the release as required by paragraph (h)(2) of the Allowable Cost and Payment clause. (3) If this contract is terminated in its entirety, the portion of the target fee payable shall not be subject to an increase or decrease as provided in this paragraph. The termination shall be accomplished in accordance with other applicable clauses of this contract. (4) For the purpose of fee adjustment, "total allowable cost" shall not include allowable costs arising out of-- (i) Any of the causes covered by the Excusable Delays clause to the extent that they are beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor or any subcontractor; (ii) The taking effect, after negotiating the target cost, of a statute, court decision, written ruling, or regulation that results in the Contractor's being required to pay or bear the burden of any tax or duty or rate increase in a tax or duty; (iii) Any direct cost attributed to the Contractor's involvement in litigation as required by the Contracting Officer pursuant to a clause of this contract, including furnishing evidence and information requested pursuant to the Notice and Assistance Regarding Patent and Copyright Infringement clause;

(5) All other allowable costs are included in "total allowable cost" for fee adjustment in accordance with this paragraph (e), unless otherwise specifically provided in this contract. (f) Contract modification. The total allowable cost and the adjusted fee determined as provided in this clause shall be evidenced by a modification to this contract signed by the Contractor and Contracting Officer. (g) Inconsistencies. In the event of any language inconsistencies between this clause and provisioning documents or Government options under this contract, compensation for spare parts or other supplies and services ordered under such documents shall be determined in accordance with this clause.

If the performancebased finance payments are on a whole contract basis, liquidation shall be by either pre-designated liquidation amounts or a liquidation percentage. (2) If at any time the amount of payments under this contract exceeds any limitation in this contract, the Contractor shall repay to the Government the excess. Unless otherwise determined by the Contracting Officer, such excess shall be credited as a reduction in the unliquidated performance-based payment balance(s), after adjustment of invoice payments and balances for any retroactive price adjustments.

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 93 of 126

not payable (if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause. (6) When the Contractor completes all of the obligations under this contract, including liquidation of all performance-based payments, title shall vest in the Contractor for all property (or the proceeds thereof) not-- (i) Delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this contract; or (ii) Incorporated in supplies delivered to, and accepted by, the Government under this contract and to which title is vested in the Government under this clause. (7) The terms of this contract concerning liability for Government-furnished property shall not apply to property to which the Government acquired title solely under this clause. (g) Risk of loss. Before delivery to and acceptance by the Government, the Contractor shall bear the risk of loss for property, the title to which vests in the Government under this clause, except to the extent the Government expressly assumes the risk. If any property is damaged, lost, stolen, or destroyed, the basis of payment (the events or performance criteria) to which the property is related shall be deemed to be not in compliance with the terms of the contract and not payable (if the property is part of or needed for performance), and the Contractor shall refund the related performance-based payments in accordance with paragraph (d) of this clause.

SECTION K ­ REPRESENTATIONS, CERTIFICATIONS AND OTHER STATEMENTS OF OFFERORS The following clauses and instructions are listed in full text. All Offerors must complete and comply with all clauses and instructions found in this Section and submit all requested data as part of their response to the RFP. Failure to respond in full may lead to an Offeror being determined non-responsive by the Contracting Officer. Additionally, TSA will obtain data on certifications and representations through ORCA (http://orca.bpn.gov) for each firm submitting a response to this RFP. All Offerors are cautioned to ensure that all ORCA data for their firms is accurate and up to date as incorrect information may also lead to an Offeror being determined non-responsive by the Contracting Officer. Information provided under Section K shall be incorporated into the contract upon award. K.1 General (a) It is the policy of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to have Offerors complete annual representations and certifications via the Online Representations and Certifications Application. Instructions for accessing ORCA and completing standard representations and certifications via ORCA are contained in the provisions below. (b) In addition to the standard representations and certifications completed in ORCA, TSA requires the completion of additional representations and certifications as part of a response to a solicitation. Those representations and certifications are provided in full text below. Offerors must complete both the ORCA and the TSA representations and certifications as part of their response to this solicitation. K.2 Instructions for Accessing and Using ORCA (a) Offerors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. (b) Offerors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to ORCA as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete. The representations and certifications are effective until one year from date of submission or update to ORCA. (c) To register with ORCA Offerors must first register with the "Central Contractor Registration" (CCR) and acquire a "Data Universal Numbering System" (DUNS) number and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN). These items may be completed at http://www.ccr.gov. (d) The (DUNS) number is a unique nine character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun & Bradstreet (D&B). Offerors must call D&B at 866-705-5711 if they do

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 101 of 126

not have a DUNS number. The process to request a DUNS number takes about 10 minutes and is free of charge. Once an Offeror has acquired a DUNS number they can then register with CCR. (e) The Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) is a 9-digit code containing at least one alpha character and one number (no special characters or spaces). The MPIN is created by the Offeror in the Offeror's CCR record and acts as a password for other various government systems. The MPIN is the last data field in the "Points of Contact" section of the registration. After an Offeror has entered the new MPIN in CCR, it will become active in ORCA when the CCR registration is activated. K.3 Affirmation of Completed Representations and Certifications in ORCA The Offeror affirms, by submission of this offer, that it has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov. After reviewing the ORCA database information, the Offeror verifies by submission of the offer that the representations and certifications currently posted electronically have been entered or updated within the last 12 months, are current, accurate, complete, and applicable to this solicitation (including the business size standard applicable to the NAICS code referenced for this solicitation), as of the date of this offer and are incorporated in this offer by reference. K.4 Provisions and Clauses Incorporated in Full Text HSAR 3052.209-72 Organizational Conflict of Interest (JUN 2006) (a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more Offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting is described below. Contractors, (under the terms of this contract), may be expected to deliver or perform information technology services to include program support or independent verification and validation work, thus placing the contractor in a potential organizational conflict of interest (OCI). This could serve as a basis for excluding the contractor from supplying services to the Department of Homeland Security. The nature of this conflict occurs: (1) When either the contractor, core team member(s) and/or subcontractor (a) has access to procurement sensitive information that may provide it an unfair advantage in competing for some or all of the proposed effort; or(b) has drafted or recommended specifications or statements of work or substantially complete statements of work; (2) the contractor reviews the work of itself or any affiliates; or (3) offers advice or planning in areas in which the contractor or any affiliates have financial interests tied to particular solutions. Under these circumstances, the potential could exist for impaired objectivity and judgment under the contract resulting from this solicitation, and for an un-

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 102 of 126

fair competitive advantage in future procurements. Therefore, due to the nature of the work being performed, the contractor shall have restrictions on future contracting as identified in HSAR clause 3052.209-73. (b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the Offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the Offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the Offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the Offeror may be found ineligible for award. (c) Disclosure: The Offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that: ___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or ___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision. (d) Mitigation. If an Offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the Offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan. (e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the Offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the Offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the Offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict. (f) Corporation Change. The successful Offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestitures that may affect this provision. (g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.

52.227-15 Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software (Dec 2007)
(a) This solicitation sets forth the Government's known delivery requirements for data (as defined in the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in Data--General). Any resulting contract may also provide the Government the option to order additional data under the Additional Data Requirements

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 103 of 126

clause at 52.227-16, if included in the contract. Any data delivered under the resulting contract will be subject to the Rights in Data--General clause at 52.227-14 included in this contract. Under the latter clause, a Contractor may withhold from delivery data that qualify as limited rights data or restricted computer software, and deliver form, fit, and function data instead. The latter clause also may be used with its Alternates II and/or III to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software, marked with limited rights or restricted rights notices, as appropriate. In addition, use of Alternate V with this latter clause provides the Government the right to inspect such data at the Contractor's facility. (b) By completing the remainder of this paragraph, the offeror represents that it has reviewed the requirements for the delivery of technical data or computer software and states [offeror check appropriate block]-- [ ] (1) None of the data proposed for fulfilling the data delivery requirements qualifies as limited rights data or restricted computer software; or [ ] (2) Data proposed for fulfilling the data delivery requirements qualify as limited rights data or restricted computer software and are identified as follows: ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________ (c) Any identification of limited rights data or restricted computer software in the offeror's response is not determinative of the status of the data should a contract be awarded to the offeror. (End of provision)

52.230-1 Cost Accounting Standards Notices and Certification. (Oct 2008)
Offerors shall examine each part and provide the requested information in order to determine Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) requirements applicable to any resultant contract.

I. DISCLOSURE STATEMENT--COST ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AND CERTIFICATION (a) Any contract in excess of $650,000 resulting from this solicitation will be subject to the requirements of the Cost Accounting Standards Board (48 CFR Chapter 99), except for those contracts which are exempt as specified in 48 CFR 9903.201-1. (b) Any offeror submitting a proposal which, if accepted, will result in a contract subject to the requirements of 48 CFR Chapter 99 must, as a condition of contracting, submit a Disclosure Statement as required by 48 CFR 9903.202. When required, the Disclosure Statement must be submitted as a part of the offeror's proposal under this solicitation unless the offeror has already submitted a Disclosure Statement disclosing the practices used in connection with the pricing of

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 104 of 126

this proposal. If an applicable Disclosure Statement has already been submitted, the offeror may satisfy the requirement for submission by providing the information requested in paragraph (c) of Part I of this provision. Caution: In the absence of specific regulations or agreement, a practice disclosed in a Disclosure Statement shall not, by virtue of such disclosure, be deemed to be a proper, approved, or agreed-to practice for pricing proposals or accumulating and reporting contract performance cost data. (c) Check the appropriate box below: [ ] (1) Certificate of Concurrent Submission of Disclosure Statement. The offeror hereby certifies that, as a part of the offer, copies of the Disclosure Statement have been submitted as follows: (i) Original and one copy to the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) or cognizant Federal agency official authorized to act in that capacity (Federal official), as applicable; and (ii) One copy to the cognizant Federal auditor.

awards of negotiated prime contracts and subcontracts subject to CAS totaling $50 million or more in the cost accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this proposal was submitted. The offeror further certifies that if such status changes before an award resulting from this proposal, the offeror will advise the Contracting Officer immediately. [ ] (4) Certificate of Interim Exemption. The offeror hereby certifies that (i) the offeror first exceeded the monetary exemption for disclosure, as defined in (3) of this subsection, in the cost accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this offer was submitted and (ii) in accordance with 48 CFR 9903.202-1, the offeror is not yet required to submit a Disclosure Statement. The offeror further certifies that if an award resulting from this proposal has not been made within 90 days after the end of that period, the offeror will immediately submit a revised certificate to the Contracting Officer, in the form specified under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of Part I of this provision, as appropriate, to verify submission of a completed Disclosure Statement. Caution: Offerors currently required to disclose because they were awarded a CAS-covered prime contractor subcontract of $50 million or more in the current cost accounting period may not claim this exemption (4). Further, the exemption applies only in connection with proposals submitted before expiration of the 90-day period following the cost accounting period in which the monetary exemption was exceeded. II. COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS--ELIGIBILITY FOR MODIFIED CONTRACT COVERAGE If the offeror is eligible to use the modified provisions of 48 CFR 9903.201-2(b) and elects to do so, the offeror shall indicate by checking the box below. Checking the box below shall mean that the resultant contract is subject to the Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices clause in lieu of the Cost Accounting Standards clause. o The offeror hereby claims an exemption from the Cost Accounting Standards clause under the provisions of 48 CFR 9903.201-2(b) and certifies that the offeror is eligible for use of the Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices clause because during the cost accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this proposal was submitted, the offeror received less than $50 million in awards of CAS-covered prime contracts and subcontracts. The offeror further certifies that if such status changes before an award resulting from this proposal, the offeror will advise the Contracting Officer immediately. Caution: An offeror may not claim the above eligibility for modified contract coverage if this proposal is expected to result in the award of a CAS-covered contract of $50 million or more or if, during its current cost accounting period, the offeror has been awarded a single CAS-covered prime contractor subcontract of $50 million or more.

HSTS02-11-R-TTC206

Page 126 of 126

determine whether these reflect a clear understanding of the requirements and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the Offeror's technical proposal. The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed staffing plan and hours against its proposed technical/management approach to determine that the proposed hours are associated cost are realistic. Any proposal lacking these attributes, regardless of its relative position with other proposals, will be considered lacking realism and may result in a higher evaluated cost. The Offeror may not use labor categories or rates other those rates included in Section B-5 of the IDIQ. The offeror may discount those rates as appropriate. In performing the cost/price analysis, the Government may use supporting data provided with each offer, past procurement history, advice from the cognizant auditors, current market conditions, performance requirements for this solicitation, or any other relevant factors, including those which have been revealed by the competition received to determine the Government's adjusted cost. All proposed task order base and optional line item prices and costs (including all estimated other direct costs and deliverables) will serve as the basis for the cost/price element of the Government trade-off analysis. The proposed approach to subcontracting, including the provision of subcontracting opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, veteranowned, and HUBZone small businesses will be evaluated, including the degree the subcontracting approach includes meaningful goals to provide significant, and appropriate opportunities for the above noted small business categories. The Offeror's corporate experience in meeting proposed subcontracting goals along with processes that have been implemented to correct inabilities to meet subcontracting goals will also be evaluated.

Contractor Performance
As a Performance Based Service Contact (PBSC) the Contractor shall achieve and maintain a measurable level of performance. Through a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, the Government has an effective means to identify and track Contractor performance relative to Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL's). An Award Fee Plan will be established to provide the Contractor an incentive to continue to improve performance. The performance range between the Objective and Threshold performance metrics provides the basis for the award fee. The section below provides the performance measures and AQL's of performance for the Task Order (TO). The threshold should identify the stretch goal for improvement in performance relative to the award fee criteria. The total award fee pool for Task Order One is not to exceed $5,000,000. SCORING ­ CONTRACT PERFORMANCE Scoring for both positive incentives and disincentives will be done in a linear fashion in the ranges stated in the table in the Award Fee Structure. Meeting the Acceptable Quality Level for the critical performance measure represents a score of 0%. Incentives earned may be offset by disincentives earned in other areas of the plan during the same award fee period. Similarly, disincentives earned may be offset by award fees earned in other areas of the plan during the same award fee period. In no event will the Contractor earn less than zero in total for critical performance measures in any given award fee period.

Solicitation HSTS02-11-R-TTCXXX

SECTION 1: OVERVIEW
1.1 Purpose This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is pursuant to the requirements of TTAC Infrastructure Modernization (TIM). The surveillance and evaluation Quality Assurance (QA) methods identified in the QASP, in concert with the Quality Control (QC) procedures as stated in the Contractor's Quality Assurance Plan (QAP), will assure the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is receiving the standard of service/quality & conformance of products detailed in the development contract PWS. The QASP states contractual performance requirements and the means to evaluate Contractor performance for the purpose of assuring the Contractor meets the performance standards of this contract, and to protect the interests of the U.S. Government and its citizens. The QASP is intended to accomplish the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Identify the TSA procedures and guidelines used to evaluate the performance of the Contractor; Define the role and responsibilities of participating TSA officials; Define the key deliverables that will be measured; Describe the rating criteria and evaluation methods employed by TSA in accessing the Contractors performance; Identify the forms, reports and resources used to document TSA's monitoring efforts and results.

TSA retains the right to change, without a contract modification, the surveillance methods and QA procedures, and to increase or decrease the degree of surveillance efforts at any time necessary to assure contract performance and compliance. However, the Contractor is responsible for assuring only conforming products/services are offered to the U.S. Government for acceptance. Other discovered contractual nonconformance requires responsive Contractor corrective action although not specifically identified for surveillance/measure within this document. 1.2 QASP Relation to Overall Performance Management Approach The documented results of the QA surveillance done under the guidance of the QASP will be employed in the performance management approach taken by TSA to monitor, manage, and take appropriate action on the Contractor's performance against expected outcomes or performance objectives communicated in the development contract PWS. The ability to make decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of performance management. The data generated by TSA's QA surveillance provides information indicating whether or not expected outcomes for required services are achieved adequately by the Contractor.

1.3 QASP Relation to the Contractor's Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) The QAP is a required element of the contract that ensures the requirements of the contract are provided as specified in the development contract PWS. The QASP represents the way in which TSA will evaluate the Contractor's performance. The Contractor's QAP and TSA's QASP and TIM should be complementary plans that ensure the Contractor's performance meets the standards defined in the development contract PWS. At a minimum, the QAP plan shall: (a) Provide the Contractor's organizational structure and functional statements showing the relationship with work items in contract. (b) Provide a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) (c) Detail a quality control inspection plan covering all general and specific tasks included in development contract PWS. It shall specify tasks or areas to be inspected on either a scheduled or unscheduled basis, or the manner in which inspections are to be conducted. (d) Detail method(s) of identifying deficiencies before performance becomes unacceptable in accordance with this Performance Work Statement; (e) Detail how Contractor personnel will be trained; (f) Detail how survey administration will be tracked and maintained; (g) Detail how review services will be examined for quality; (h) Include data collection and reporting processes to support each performance measure, monthly sample sizes required for each measure (if necessary), quality control roles and responsibilities, risk management plan to ensure acceptable quality levels are obtained and associated tools and templates; (i) Outline the processes the Contractor will deploy to ensure adherence with the AQLs set forth in the Governments QASP; (j) Include Program Management Monthly Reviews; (k) Surveillances to include random sampling, schedule monitoring and surveying; 1.4 QASP Revisions The QASP is a tool for use in TSA's administration of the contract, and remains subject to revision at any time by TSA throughout the contract performance period. Revisions to this surveillance plan are the responsibility of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). Changes may be made unilaterally without Contractor agreement; TSA will provide informational copies to the Contractor at its option.

The Contractor is responsible for implementing its QAP for producing, maintaining, and providing for audit, quality control records and reports, and all records associated with the investigation and resolution of customer complaints. 2.2 Government Responsibilities The key Government personnel responsible for QA are the Contracting Officer (CO), the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), the Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAEs), Program Manager (PM) and the Users/Customers. When assigned by memorandum, the Contracting Officer (CO) can assign a QA responsibility to government personnel from within the PMO. 2.2.1 Contracting Officer (CO) 2.2.1.1 The CO has the authority to administer the contract, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract, and safeguards the interests of TSA in the contractual relationship. The CO may delegate many of the day-to-day contract administration duties to the COTR and QAEs. However, certain contractual actions such as negotiation and issuance of contract modifications, resolution of Contractor claims and disputes, issuance of cure notices, issuance of show-cause letters (following a cure notice, requesting facts bearing on the case), termination of the contract, and contract close-out functions are retained by the CO. 2.2.1.2 The CO ensures the Contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under the contract. The CO is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor's performance. All communication regarding questions or issues related to QA and inspection will be directed to the CO or the COTR. Any changes that the Contractor deems may affect contract, price, terms, or conditions may only be referred to the CO for action. The CO shall approve any revision to the QASP processes or standards. 2.2.1.3 In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 42.302(a)(57), the CO also delegates specific surveillance tasks and authorities by formal letter to the COTR and QAE. Administrative actions such as invoice approval and issuance of Contract Discrepancy Reports may be delegated by the CO to the COTR. 2.2.2 Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR)

2.2.2.1 The COTR is the individual designated in writing by the CO to act as the authorized representative for contract administration and is designated to act as a liaison between TSA and the Contractor on all technical issues pertinent to the daily operation of the contract. COTR limitations are contained in the written letter of designation issued by the CO. The COTR is not empowered to make contractual commitments or authorize contractual changes on TSA's behalf. 2.2.2.2 The COTR represents the CO in all technical functions and is therefore the Contractor's initial point-of-contact with TSA. In turn, the COTR may delegate some responsibilities, such as oversight to other TSA individuals. 2.2.2.3 For tasks and/or subtasks which include performance incentives, the COTR will provide recommendations to the CO for action. If modifications to the contract are necessary, the COTR will assist the CO in preparing and negotiating the modifications. If technical performance is incomplete or deficient or the Contractor is non-compliant with any term of the contract, the COTR will notify the Contractor and request corrective action be taken. Since the Contractor is provided an opportunity to correct non-compliant issues/problems and deficiencies, requested corrective action is at the expense of the Contractor. Deficient performance is documented in the Contractor's file as historical Contract Past Performance. Contractor efforts to correct poor performance, noncompliance and performance deficiencies in an efficient and effective manner will be noted and included in the file. 2.2.3 Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) 2.2.3.1 The COTR will either serve as or appoint a QAE. Appointed QAEs have only the authority delegated to them in writing by the COTR and/or CO. The QAE is not empowered to make contractual commitments, authorize contractual changes, direct or interfere with the methods of performance by the Contractor, or to issue directions to any Contractor personnel on TSA's behalf while performing the duties as a QAE. 2.2.3.2 The QAEs perform the actual contract surveillance and report to the COTR. Some of the key contract administration duties of QAEs include, but are not limited to, the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Perform surveillance as required by this QASP, and make recommendations to the COTR regarding issues of noncompliance, deficiency or commendation; Make recommendations to the COTR for the acceptance or rejection of completed work, and for administrative actions based on unsatisfactory work or non-performed work; Assist the COTR in identifying necessary contract modifications; Make recommendations to the COTR for changes to the QASP; Assist the COTR with the analysis and preparation of Contractor performance and cost reports.

2.2.3.3 The QAEs may use the form provided in Appendix B: Quality Assurance Monitoring Report for each service requirement to be inspected, or such other forms as

Solicitation HSTS02-11-R-TTCXXX

approved by the COTR. Once complete, this checklist includes the specific tasks to be checked, and whether the inspection results in a Contractor rating of excellent, compliant or noncompliant performance. 2.2.3.4 The QAE will be knowledgeable about the products and/or services provided by the Contractor, able to identify deficiencies in product and/or services, and is responsible for documenting and reporting all inspection observations. QAEs may be trained and qualified in appropriate surveillance techniques in order to maintain the degree of objectivity necessary for valid and unbiased surveillance and evaluation. The role of QAE need not be the primary duty of the individual(s) in the position. The Government Test Manager and Test Lead are designated QAEs. The Test Manager and Test Lead bring first handed knowledge of Development Test and Evaluation (DT&E) into the quality of the development. For this reason the Test Manager and Test Lead will provide quality observation reports for the CO consideration and approval. 2.2.4 Customers Customers are the various organizations supported by the Contractor (e.g. TTAC Adjudication Center, Program and Enrollment Services' Office (PESO) designated programs, etc.). Customers may be requested to assist the QAEs and Customer Feedback Program. The information gained from the Customer Feedback Program may be used in conjunction with other methods of observation to rate the performance of the Contractor. 2.2.5 Government Personnel 2.2.5.1 TSA's personnel are identified as follows: 2.2.5.2 Contracting Officer: Renee Grace 2.2.5.3 Contracting Officer's Technical Representative: Cheryl Kirk 2.2.5.4 QAEs: Frank Piazza, Mathew Kauffman, Rex Lovelady and Ron Bartels. 2.2.5.5 The ILS and maintenance support program is provided by the Contractor in accordance with the development contract PWS. In the development contract PWS the performance standards are established or referenced, and the acceptable level of performance is set in the Acceptable Quality Limit (AQL) related to that paragraph. 2.2.5.6 Performance of the Contractor will be monitored through various surveillance methods described in Section 4: Performing Quality Assurance. Performance data gathered will be evaluated to assess Contractor performance against contract requirements. In some cases, specific metrics are used to measure Contractor performance; in other cases subjective judgment and evaluation by TSA personnel will be the determining criteria. This plan describes the methodology utilized to make both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Contractor performance under the contract.

SECTION 3: PERFORMANCE DESCRIPTION
3.1 Performance Standards and Acceptable Quality Limits (AQLs) For selected activities in the development contract PWS, the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) in Appendix A provides the development contract PWS performance standards and AQLs. A performance standard is the expected level of Contractor performance. AQL defines the level of performance that is satisfactory. Depending on the service/product evaluated and the evaluation method selected, performance standards and AQLs may be stated as a number of occurrences or as a percentage. The contract requires all work be performed as specified. Any inaccuracies, omissions or failures to meet performance standards in services, are referred to as "nonconformities." Some instances exist where an allowable level of nonconformities are possible while overall performance continues to meet TSA's desired AQL or performance standard. The Contractor shall be held responsible for all identified nonconformities, and TSA may require the Contractor to re-perform or correct the work at no additional cost to TSA. The AQLs define the level or number of performance deficiencies the Contractor is permitted to reach under this contract. AQLs take into account the difference between an occasional nonconformity and a gross number of nonconformities. AQLs for Maintenance, Operational Availability (Ao) and Operational Availability ­ Operational Hours (Ao-Ops) are expressed as a finite percentage. 3.2 Performance Requirements Performance areas include those listed in Appendix A of this document. 3.3 Ratings Analysis of monitoring may result in one of the following outcomes: Exceeds, Compliant, Noncompliant, Level 1, Noncompliant, Level 2, or Deficient. All rating levels may not be applicable to every development contract PWS requirement evaluated. 3.3.1 Exceeds Performance of the Contractor substantially exceeds the minimum performance standard or AQLs, and achievement(s) exists with no significant deficiencies. Incentives may also be provided in accordance with the Contract for services performed and receiving the rating of exceeds. 3.3.2 Compliant Performance meets the minimum contractual performance standards or AQLs. The services rendered are considered compliant where there has been no significant departure from the terms of the contract and no omission of essential work.

Task Order 1 - TIM Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

Solicitation HSTS02-11-R-TTCXXX

3.3.3 Noncompliant Performance of the Contractor does not meet the minimum contractual performance standards or AQLs for a given requirement. The contractual performance of the task or sub-task being assessed reflects a deficiency for which the Contractor's actions or proposed actions appear only marginally effective, or were not fully implemented. Noncompliant Level 1 indicates the Contractor's performance does not meet the minimum performance standards or AQLs. The contractual performance of the task or sub-task contains some minor problems or omissions for which corrective actions by the Contractor are needed. Generally applies to deliverables submitted that do not address the minimum Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) and/or Data Item Description (DID) requirements. Noncompliant Level 2 indicates the performance does not meet the minimum performance standards or AQLs and the noncompliance is systemic within the performance area. Generally applies to deliverables submitted that do not address the minimum CDRL/DID requirements and the absence thereof restricts the Government's insight into other performance metrics. Because deficiencies impact the Government's insight into other contract performance metrics or the Government's ability to meet mission on time, it requires a higher level management involvement and immediate corrective action. The Contractor must identify the root cause of the problem/noncompliance and remove the systemic causes. 3.3.4 Deficient Performance of the Contractor is non-compliant and substantially fails to meet the minimum contractual performance standards or AQLs for a given requirement causing concern to the Government. Contractor performance severely restricts the Government's insight into data or ability to meet its mission necessary to evaluate Key Performance Parameter (KPP) compliance, and/or reflects sustained performance ratings of noncompliance. 3.3.5 Severely Deficient Performance of the Contractor is not only non-compliant and substantially fails to meet minimum contractual performance standards or AQLs for a given requirement but the Contractor is non-compliant in meeting terms of the contract that impacts the Government's ability to meet development schedule, capabilities, readiness or mission. At this time, the Contractor's proposed remedies may not be able to restore the Government's development schedule within allotted budget, scheduled time and capabilities or readiness to meet mission. Contractor top-level management is involved in the execution and completion of the contract's requirements. The Government may seek Termination for Default.

3.4 Documentation Thorough documentation is essential for tracking Contractor performance throughout the evaluation period. The QAEs will document noncompliant and deficient work by compiling facts describing the inspection methods and results. Contract performance receiving Noncompliant or Deficient ratings will be documented and included in the contract Past Performance database. Documentation shall include the surveillance and discrepancy reports/results. Sample documentation reporting forms are provided in Appendix B: Quality Assurance Monitoring Report Form and Appendix E: Service Provider Discrepancy Report. The COTR and QAEs will develop documentation to substantiate nonconformance with the contract. The documentation, together with any recommendations, will be forwarded to the COTR. The COTR will decide whether to elevate the problem to the CO for corrective action. 3.5 Remedial Actions The FAR allows for penalties in the event that the Contractor fails to perform the required services. Penalties are defined as those actions taken under the direction of the CO against the Contractor within the general provisions of the contract for noncompliance to the development contract PWS and PRS. Requirements may contain multiple performance elements, and therefore, deficiencies may occur in one or more aspects of performance (e.g., timeliness, accuracy, completeness, etc.). When surveillance indicates that the Contractor's performance is not in compliance with the contract requirements, the QAE must determine whether the Contractor or TSA/User caused the deficiency. If the cause of the nonconformity rests with TSA, the Contractor is still required to perform corrective action. However, the noncompliance will not count against the Contractor's performance, and additional costs to the Contractor may be considered for reimbursement. If the cause of the nonconformity is due to action or inaction by the Contractor, the Contractor is totally responsible for correction of the problem at no additional expense to TSA. 3.5.1 Noncompliant Requirements may contain multiple performance elements, and therefore, deficiencies may occur in one or more aspects of performance (e.g., timeliness, accuracy, completeness, etc.). When surveillance indicates that the Contractor's performance is not in compliance with the contract requirements, the QAE must determine whether the Contractor or TSA/User caused the deficiency. If the cause of the nonconformity rests with TSA, the Contractor is still required to perform corrective action. However, the noncompliance will not count against the Contractor's performance, and additional costs to the Contractor may be considered for reimbursement. If the cause of the nonconformity is due to action or inaction by the Contractor, the Contractor is totally responsible for correction of the problem at no additional expense to TSA.

TSA may increase its level of surveillance if the COTR determines that the Contractor provides sustained performance with significant deficiencies. The COTR may also determine the need for the Contractor to develop a corrective plan of action if repeat noncompliant ratings for a requirement are received. Noncompliant Level 1 Contractor corrects deficiencies within 30 days of notification by COTR at no additional cost to the Government. Failure to correct incomplete work may result in performance being evaluated as non-compliant Level 2 or Deficient. Contractual disincentives are applied Noncompliant Level 2 Contractor corrects deficiencies within 15 days of notification by COTR at no additional cost to the Government. Failure to correct deficient work may result in performance being evaluated as Deficient. Contractual disincentives are applied. 3.5.2 Deficient The contractual remedies are applied by the CO.

SECTION 4: PERFORMING QUALITY ASSURANCE
The QAEs perform contract surveillance and report to the COTR. The QA Monitoring methods used in the QA process are TSA's tools to monitor the Contractor's products and services. The best means of determining whether contract requirements have been met is to inspect the Contractor's service products and analyze the results. Further, documented inspection results are an effective tool in contract administration. Inspections either confirm the Contractor's successful achievement of all performance requirements, or highlight areas where nonconformities exist and improvements are necessary. The QA personnel are responsible for developing a monthly schedule of surveillance activities based on QASP requirements. The schedule should be completed no later than five (5) business days before the beginning of the period it covers. The COTR must retain a copy of the schedule for the documentation files. 4.1 Surveillance Methods The following performance monitoring methods can be applied individually or in combination. The method or combination of methods used when conducting an inspection should be noted when describing the surveillance methods on the QA Monitoring Form found in Appendix B. Surveillance methods should be chosen and implemented with the goal of minimizing intrusive disruption. Management Information Systems (MIS) reports can assist 100% inspection, random sampling or periodic inspection, and may be used to evaluate outputs through the use of management information reports. When using Contractor-generated reports, this method is best for general surveillance, and may need to be supplemented by periodic inspections. The QAE may accept Contractor-generated reports at face value, but use other methods to investigate problem areas. 4.1.1 Direct Observations Direct observation of Contractor performance can be performed periodically or through 100% inspection. Direct Observations may be scheduled or unscheduled. Scheduled Observations are previously scheduled and coordinated with the Contractor's site supervisor. Unscheduled Observations may be conducted at random by TSA personnel as directed. 4.1.2 100% Inspection The 100% inspection method requires complete inspection of a contract requirement and will be used for requirements that are especially critical or where there is some reason for suspecting that the performance standard or AQL is not being met (and therefore, should be more closely monitored). The performance standards and AQLs are provided in the development contract PWS and Performance Requirements Summary (PRS).

Solicitation HSTS02-11-R-TTCXXX

4.1.3 Random Sampling Random Sampling is the most appropriate method for recurring tasks. This QA method is designed to evaluate Contractor performance by randomly selecting and inspecting a statistically significant sample. Random sampling is recommended for large quantity repetitive actives with objective and measurable quality attributes. The random sampling procedures consider the AQL, the level of the evaluation effort, and the population size. There are two ways of applying random sampling for QA surveillance. The first is used only for performance evaluation, and allows deductions to be taken only for observed nonconformities; the second is random sampling for performance evaluation and deduction projection, which allows deductions against the whole population based on the inspection of the sample. 4.1.4 Periodic Inspection Periodic inspection, sometimes called "planned sampling," provides a systematic way of looking at service outputs and forming conclusions about the Contractor's level of performance in accordance with a planned schedule of surveillance. Evaluation by periodic inspection is designed to inspect some part but not all of the products and services being monitored. Periodic inspection is generally used in two ways. First, it can provide a one-time subjective evaluation of Contractor performance. Second, it can be used to detect a change in the Contractor's level of performance (i.e., trend analysis). This method requires that the sample selection criteria be well documented and consistently applied from period to period, and that there are no other intervening factors. With this type of evaluation, the QAEs are able to direct efforts to those areas where inspections are most needed, and the Contractor knows that those areas are more likely to be monitored than others. Periodic inspection provides means by making comparisons between observed and overall performance, and the Contractor's overall level of performance. The levels of evaluation appropriate for periodic inspection are judgmental. In order to perform trend analysis from periodic inspection, criteria for sample selection should be applied consistently from period to period. Observed deficiencies monitored by periodic inspection will be totaled and assessed at the end of each evaluation period. For each requirement, the findings will be compared to the performance standard and AQL. 4.1.5 Customer Feedback Validated customer feedback is a QA method based on customer and Contractor interaction that can be used to supplement more systematic methods. Customers continually receive the outputs of Contractor performance and are in a position to evaluate the Contractor on a recurring basis. Because customers have a clear stake in the quality of Contractor services, they are valuable resources for the QA personnel.

Task Order 1 - TIM Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

Solicitation HSTS02-11-R-TTCXXX

Customers are made aware of contract requirements and monitor the services provided by the Contractor, both positive and negative. Where there is a case of poor performance or non-performance, customers notify the QAEs. The QAEs then investigate the report and, if found to be valid, document their findings. The numbers of complaints and resulting inspections depend upon customer awareness and response. If the complaint is valid and caused by poor performance or non-performance by the Contractor, the Contractor must take appropriate corrective action. A valid complaint is one in which the QAE confirms that poor performance or non-performance violates contract requirements. Following the contract award, the COTR should send letters to all or selected customer points-of-contact. These letters will inform them of the need for active participation in the overall QA Program. The COTR will also provide a Customer Feedback Record (sample at Appendix D) for the customer to use to either document performance problems or identify when superior services are received. The QAEs will validate the submitted Customer Feedback Records. It is primarily the responsibility of the Contractor to investigate each complaint to determine the problem. While QAEs can also investigate customer complaints, the responsibility for initial review shall remain with the Contractor. At TSA's discretion, the QAE may investigate problems from customer groups and complaints involving major problems with services being provided. The Contractor shall take action when a Customer Feedback Record is received. If a valid complaint exists, the Contractor shall re-perform the product or service. Corrective actions shall be implemented to prevent the recurrence of similar problems in the future, or detect and fix such problems before a product or service is delivered to a customer. If the customer complaint is found to be invalid, the COTR shall educate the customer regarding contract requirements as they pertain to the customer's expectations. Trend analysis may be used to test for variations in the number of complaints received each month, and to identify changes in Contractor performance. 4.2 Levels of Inspection Three levels of inspection, "Normal," "Reduced" and "Tightened" are utilized for the random sampling surveillance method. It is expected that during the initial period following contract award, all operational procedures and QC measures will be tested and implemented. Normal inspection will be used upon the initialization of the contract, unless otherwise directed by the COTR. As the performance period progresses, the levels of surveillance may be altered, as specified below, for service areas in cases where performance ratings are either consistently noncompliant, or deficient, or returns to compliant. 4.2.1 Switching Levels of Inspection

TTAC Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) Program

Task Order 1 - TIM Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

Solicitation HSTS02-11-R-TTCXXX

The COTR is responsible for initiating paperwork to the CO requesting the level of inspection be changed in most cases. Changing from normal to tightened inspection levels does not require the CO's approval. When normal inspection is in effect, tightened inspection will be instituted when 2-outof-5 or fewer consecutive items are noncompliant or deficient on original inspection (ignoring resubmissions). When tightened inspection is in effect, normal inspection may be reinstituted at the discretion of the COTR when five (5) consecutive items have been found compliant on original inspection. 4.2.2 Tightened Inspection Tightened inspection can be used when condition set by the COTR are not being met. When increased inspection is in effect, a return to normal inspection will occur when performance is compliant.

SECTION 5: DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTS
5.1 Documentation Requirements Accurate and complete documentation is necessary for the administration of the QASP. The COTR will, in addition to providing documentation to the CO, maintain a complete QA file. The file will contain copies of all reports, evaluations, recommendations, surveillance checklists, and any actions related to TSA's performance of the quality assurance surveillance function. All such records will be retained for the life of the contract and forwarded to the CO upon completion. 5.2 Reports 5.2.1 Quality Assurance Monitoring Reports This report is used to document surveillance as it is conducted. 5.2.2 QA Report At the end of the evaluation period or as required by the CO, the COTR will prepare a written report for the CO summarizing the overall results of the quality assurance monitoring of the Contractor's performance. This report, consisting of a summary, the Contractor's submitted reports, and the completed Quality Assurance Monitoring Forms, will become part of the QA documentation.
