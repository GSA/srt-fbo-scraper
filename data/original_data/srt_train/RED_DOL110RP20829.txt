1.    GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1.  Description of Services/Introduction:  The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Employment and Training Administration (ETA), Office of
      Unemployment Insurance (OUI) is seeking an experienced contractor to provide Automated Data Processing (ADP), Operations – hardware, and
      hotline (call center) support for its IT National, Regional and States IT in-house developed software applications.
      These services will be performed on-site.

   2. Background:  The mission of the Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) is to work collaboratively with partners and stakeholders in
      business, labor, State and local governments by:
     A. Providing leadership, direction, and assistance to state workforce agencies in the implementation and administration of state
        unemployment insurance (UI) programs, Federal unemployment compensation programs, and other wage-loss, worker dislocation and adjustment
        assistance compensation programs.
     B. Managing strategically in order to ensure high performance, greater public accountability, service quality and customer satisfaction;
        and providing support for the Administrator's Office through policy assistance, workflow coordination, management of daily operations
        and serving as an "information provider" for OUI customers.
     C. The main program that this office supports is the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Program.
        1. The Federal-State unemployment insurance program, initiated in the Social Security Act of 1935, has been a first line of defense
           against the economic hazards of unemployment, not only for individual workers but also for their communities. For workers,
           unemployment compensation means a continuation of some income, ensuring money for at least a portion of life's necessities, during
           temporary periods of involuntary unemployment.  For communities, the money paid in benefits to unemployed workers often flows to
           local businesses within the community, thereby reducing the impact of recessions by extending the purchasing power of the unemployed.
        2. The unemployment compensation system is a Federal-State cooperative program providing benefits to eligible unemployed workers under
           State law that is administered by State officials.  Laws vary from State-to-State, but include Federal law requirements as set forth
           in the Social Security Act and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA).  Public Law 103-152, enacted on November 24, 1993, amended
           the Social Security Act by adding a new subsection 303(j), requiring the State Agency charged with administration of State
           unemployment compensation law to establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for compensation.  The system
           identifies which claimants are likely to exhaust compensation and will need job search assistance services to make a successful
           transition to new employment and then refers these claimants to re-employment services.

        3. With the exception of a few States where there are small payments made by employees, the UI program is financed by a payroll tax on
           employers.  About 97 percent of wage and salary workers are covered by the Federal-State system.

   1. The Basic System:  The UI Program is federally administered by the Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI), a component of the Department of
      Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA).  The UI Program mission, functions and responsibilities, include:
     A. Mission.  The UI program is the nation's response to the adverse effects of unemployment.  The program's mission is to provide
        unemployed workers with temporary income support and to facilitate re-employment.
     B. Functions/Responsibilities.  Federal laws establish a clear responsibility for OUI to perform a variety of functions, which can be
        clustered into two categories:
   1. Ensure legal requirements are met.  OUI is required to:
           a) ensure that State laws are consistent with Federal UI laws;
           b) perform certain tasks which are central to the administration of the entire system (e.g., formulate budgets and allocate funds for
              the operation of each State's program);
           c) provide for stewardship of the program as a whole (e.g., manage and ensure integrity of the Federal and State Trust Fund
              resources; maintain a research program to supply information to guide legislative and program design changes; manage and support
              information technology systems which generate data and analysis to support all responsibilities and improve operations; operate
              system-wide support efforts which are best done centrally); and
           d) formulate policy for Federal UI programs (e.g., Trade Act programs and emergency compensation extensions) and then ensure that all
              States, acting as agents for the Department of Labor (DOL) under a written agreement, properly administer these Federal programs.
   2. Ensure that States properly administer the State programs that they operate under their own laws.  OUI must certify States that meet all
      FUTA and SSA conformity and compliance requirements for tax credit and administrative grants.


1.2.2.      Automated Data Processing (ADP) Background:  The Unemployment Insurance Database Management System (UIDBMS) is a comprehensive
      system that helps the National and Regional Offices to perform the oversight and monitoring function of the State UI operations.  This
      oversight and monitoring process was designed to promote continuous improvement in UI operational performance. The automated systems, which
      support these functions at the State, Regional and National level, are developed, implemented, and maintained by the Office of Unemployment
      Insurance (OUI).
      Like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), OUI is responsible for economic indicators.  This data, such as weekly initial claims and
      continued claims for multiple programs, must be kept secured.  This data is provided in advance to executive management of the Federal
      Reserve Board, Council of Economic Advisors, and DOL management. Security infrastructures for the automated systems are needed to protect
      not only critical information but also the unique formulae used.  These are customized to minimize the risk of premature availability of
      information.  Should this data be available to the public prematurely, the financial markets could be adversely impacted.
      Beginning in the middle 1970s, an increasing emphasis was placed on the integration of automated systems into the workplace at both the
      Federal and State levels.  Like automation technology, this effort has grown enormously over the past three decades.  Today, OUI automation
      effort is critical to the mission and functions of the entire organization.
      In the mid to late 1980s, the move from complete reliance on timesharing services to self-support using micro, super-micro, and mini
      computers began.  As technology and the UI programs and applications have evolved, so has the environment in which OUI operates.  In
      addition to the decline in the demand for timesharing resources - UI has migrated to systems and software more closely aligned with the
      marketplace and to applications available on smaller processors.  Specifically, OUI is oriented to UNIX operating systems and has heavy
      reliance on in-house software applications developed on the UNIX platform.
      In the early to late 1990s, application development Tools used includes Relational Database (Informix), Informix-4GL, Informix-ESQL/C, C
      programming language, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based application builder (Prolifics’s Panther), Motif, JavaScript, Perl/PHP and
      HTML.  As of 2009, the Informix Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) has become OUI's de facto database standard.
      While one or two legacy applications are still being maintained, currently, most applications development have been converted to and are
      now being implemented in the Web environment using Sun Microsystems Java, JavaScript, Spring framework, AJAX, framework for Java
      application development, HTML, Perl, PHP.
      The UI program is currently supported by a wide-range of computer systems comprised of UNIX-based workstations, PC LAN servers, PCs and
      various networking components, modems, and printers.  Commercial software products (e.g., MS Office XP, MS Outlook, Photoshop 5, SPSS,
      etc.) and in-house developed and supported systems as well as sub-systems provide automation support.
      The Unemployment Insurance Database Management System (UIDBMS) is comprised of the following applications:
     A. Unemployment Insurance Reports (UIR) – UI workload, performance and financial reports submitted by states as required by Federal law.
     B. Tax Performance System (TPS) - systems and analytical support for data necessary to oversee tax programs.
     C. Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) - systems and analytical support for data necessary to oversee benefit payment and non-payment
        accuracy.
     D. Benefit Financing Group (BFG) - programming and support in estimation, simulation, and actuarial systems.
     E. Budget Group Projects (BGP) - systems for administrative and financial management activities.
     F. Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) - programming and support in providing benefit assistance because of a major disaster.
     G. Data Validation (DV) - ensuring the accuracy of data on submitted UI reports.

1.2.3 The OUI Network:  The Office of Unemployment Insurance - working with the ETA’s Technology Office, the Office of Performance and
      Technology (PROTECH) - will be responsible for the overall procurement, development, integration, modification, operation, and maintenance
      of the ADP support contract.
     A. Infrastructure:  The current ETA network that support OUI’ mission is a National Office network integrated into two local area networks
        (LANs)[The ETA LAN and the Regional LAN], and a wide area network (WAN).
        1. The ETA LAN is based on the Windows 2003 networking operation system with Windows 2003 Workstation as the client base.  The ETA
           network is managed by the Performance and Technology (PROTECH) Office.  Services provided include data communications and office
           automation capabilities for ETA organizations only.  The network facilitates users to access and manipulate the major application and
           other services, such as home directories, on the LAN and provides office automation capabilities for the applications.
        2. There are several types of communications services currently used on the ETA LAN including:
           a) dedicated circuits,
           b) an Interstate Connection (ICON) frame relay network (managed by the MD Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (MD DLLR)),
           c) remote access dial-up/dial-out,
           d) email and
           e) Internet connectivity.
        3. The dedicated circuits are used for communication between the OUI Regional Offices, and the National Office while ICON, remote access
           dial-up, and Internet connectivity services are used for communications from the National Office to the State sites.
        4. The ETA LAN also provides users with access to the Internet.  Data communications allow users to maintain and use their e-mail and
           Internet / Intranet services.  Internet services are provided via T1 line connections using Cisco Routers for IP (internet protocol)
           routing and filtering.
        5. The ETA network provides the infrastructure for the OUI UNIX network.  This network is comprised of the National Office's UNIX-based
           computers and 54 computer systems located in each State, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Virgin Islands and the UI Training
           Center in St. Paul, Minnesota.
        6. Regional users have their own Regional LAN that is connected to the ETA network via fractional T1 frame relay leased lines.  Regional
           users may select a menu option from their login menu that will connect them via the fractional T1 lines directly to the OUI UNIX
           network.
        7. The OUI UNIX network has been integrated into ETA's LAN.  Data and E-mail are transferred to and from the National Office UNIX
           network and the 54 State computer systems via ICON, Internet connectivity services or remote access dial-up (back-up only).  Some
           State Agencies have integrated their UNIX systems with larger State networks (generally PC-based) that are connected to the Internet;
           for these States modem communications for data transfer and E-mail have been replaced by Internet connectivity.
        8. Currently, the OUI UNIX network consists of a mixture of SUN Enterprise servers running SUN Solaris 10 and Windows 2003.
        9. Batch file transfers between the National Office and the State sites occur primarily by asynchronous dial-up links and the UNIX-to-
           UNIX copy (UUCP) protocol.  Each State has a Sun Fire T2000 server that is polled by systems at the National Office.  State sites are
           not allowed to dial into the National Office systems.
       10. A simple network topology diagram of the UIDBMS is provided below.

     A. Security:  The ETA LAN is protected via a Firewall, anti-virus-scans, and an intrusion detection device.  Since the OUI UNIX Network is
        integrated into the ETA LAN, these security measures protect this network as well.
        1. The OUI UNIX Network security encompasses the following six major general control areas:
           a) Entity wide security program planning and management:  includes assessing risks, establishing policies, evaluating the
              effectiveness of controls and other sound management activities necessary for a comprehensive computer security program.
           b) Access controls:  includes all measures that limit or detect inappropriate access to computer resources (data, equipment, and
              facilities).
           c) Application software development and change control:  all measures which prevent unauthorized software programs or modifications
              from being implemented.
           d) Segregation of Duties:  includes those policies, procedures, and organizational structure that help ensure that one individual
              cannot control all key aspects of a process or computer-related operation.
           e) System Software Controls:  includes those measures taken to limit and monitor access to the powerful programs and sensitive files
              associated with computer system operations.
           f) Service Continuity Controls:  these controls ensure that critical computer operations continue when unexpected events occur and
              that critical and sensitive data are protected.  IT contingency and disaster planning and testing are included.
        2. ETA Security Policy is based on and consistent with the guidance and information contained in the following documents:
           a) U.S. Department of Labor Computer Security Handbook, December 2007
           b) Federal Information Systems Management Act of 2002, 44 U.S.C. § 3541; Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002 (Pub.L. 107-347,
              116 Stat. 2899).
           c) Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual, United States General Accounting Office (GAO/AIMD -12.19.6), February 2009.
           d) Guide for Developing Security Plans for Information Technology Systems, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
              Publication 800-18, Revision 1.
           e) Management of Federal Information Resources, Office of Management and Budget, February 8, 1996.
           f) Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-579
           g) Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63
           h) Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235
           i) Computer Fraud & Abuse Act of 1986, as amended, Public Law 99-474


        3. PROTECH, with input from OUI, completes security and risk assessments as stipulated by references mentioned above and has in place a
           comprehensive security plan following NIST 800-18 guidelines.  A security audit on the OUI system is performed at least once every
           year to ensure that the systems and the data are adequately secured.
        4. PROTECH has implemented measures to ensure the security of its systems including systems owns by OUI and privacy of its data and OUI
           data.  All systems use third party security and intrusion detection tools as well as standard security features as part of the
           operating system.  However, in the wake of hacker exploits and intrusion into other similar governmental systems, continuous
           improvements to security and awareness become necessary.
        5. Disaster Recovery and Contingency:  PROTECH has in place a defined disaster recovery (DR) and contingency plan.  A disaster recovery
           network, via an ICON connection to the Atlanta DR site, has been implemented.


   3. Objectives:  OUI is now seeking maintenance and enhancement of UIDBMS applications.  As well as converting the remaining legacy
      applications to a web-based environment, OUI also develops new applications as determined by the Program Offices in OUI based on new laws
      and legislation passed by Congress.


   4. OUI Organization:
      Currently, the OUI organization consists of one headquarter, the Office Administration, and four divisions.
     A. Office of the Administrator:  The Office of Administrator provides leadership, direction and assistance to state workforce agencies in
        the implementation and administration of state unemployment insurance (UI) programs, Federal unemployment compensation programs, and

prior to the arrival of Government personnel.  Normal business hours are Monday through Friday, except for Federal holidays, or when the
Government facility is closed due to local or national emergencies, administrative closings or other Government directed facility closings.  The
workday consists of eight (8) hours per day. Work hours outside the normal workday and administrative workweek, if needed; require advance
approval from the Contracting Officer Technical Representative. There will be no overtime rates unless negotiated and approved in writing by the
Contractor Officer Technical Representative (COTR). Contractor personnel shall be present for work within the normal workday and administrative
workweek unless prior approval has been granted for leave/vacation or other excused absence (i.e. sick leave).

H.23   METHODS OF OPERATION


       The Contractor shall provide sufficient oversight of the contract in order to ensure that:
          A. All employees are functioning within their designated labor categories and at acceptable levels of performance.
          B. All activities performed are covered by applicable Task Orders and directly related to Part 5 General Statement of Work (SOW).  Time
             spent on non-project related activities must not be billed to the Government.
          C. Employee positions called for are filled promptly (i.e., within 15 business days of contract award) and kept filled with qualified,
             competent personnel. No personnel matters such as recruiting, reviewing resumes, and initial interviewing as well as Contractor
             (Corporate) meetings are directly billable to the Government.
          D. All documentation is written and updated in accordance with PROTECH CM / QA standards.
          E. All Contractor employees are performing their designated assignments in a timely manner and all reporting requirements are honored.
          F. All Contractor employees have been trained in proper office procedures as pertains to business professionals.
          G. All Contractor employees receive on-going technical training as described in the Offeror’s proposal.

H.24   ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS (OCI):

       Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI):  The policy of DOL is to avoid contracting with contractors who have unacceptable
       organizational conflicts of interest.  An organizational conflict of interest means that because of existing or planned activities, an
       offeror or Contractor is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial assistance to the agency, or has an unfair competitive
       advantage, or the offeror or Contractor’s objectivity is, or might be, impaired.  If the offeror does not have any OCI issues, it must
       positively affirm so in writing.

       The following provides potential vendors with examples of situations where mitigation plans may or may not be required by DOL.  These
       examples are not intended to be inclusive.

       Unequal access to information.  Access to “nonpublic information” as part of the performance of a DOL contract could provide the
       contractor a competitive advantage in a later competition for any other DOL contract.  Such an advantage could easily be perceived as
       unfair by a competing vendor who is not given similar access to the relevant information.  If the requirements of DOL procurement
       anticipate the successful contractor may have access to nonpublic information, the successful contractor should be required to submit and
       negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.  Alternatively, the “nonpublic information” may be provided to all contractors.


       Biased ground rules.  A contractor in the course of performance of a DOL contract, has in some fashion established important “ground
       rule” for another DOL contract, where the same contractor may be a competitor.  For example, a contractor may have drafted the SOW,
       specifications, or evaluation criteria of a future DOL procurement.  The primary concern of DOL in this case is that a contractor so
       situated could slant key aspects of procurement in its own favor, to the unfair disadvantage of competing contractors.  If the
       requirements of DOL procurement anticipate the contractor may have been in a position to establish important ground rules, including but
       not limited to those described herein, the contractor should be required to submit and negotiate an acceptable mitigation plan.


       Impaired objectivity.  A contractor in the course of performance of a DOL contract is placed in a situation of providing assessment and
       evaluation findings over itself, or another business division, or subsidiary of the same corporation, or other entity with which it has a
       significant financial relationship.  The concern in this case is that the contractor’s ability to render impartial advice to DOL could
       appear to be undermined by the contractor’s financial or other business relationship to the entity whose work product is being assessed
       or evaluated.  In these situations, a “walling off” of lines of communication may well be insufficient to remove the perception that the
       objectivity of the contractor has been tainted.  If the requirements of the DOL procurement indicate that the successful contractor may
       be in a position to provide evaluations and assessments of itself or corporate siblings, or other entity with which it has a significant
       financial relationship, the affected Contractor should provide a mitigation plan that includes recusal by the Contractor from the
       affected contract work.  Such recusal might include divestiture of the work to a third party vendor.

       Disclosure by offerors or contractors participating in a DOL acquisition.  Offerors or contractors should provide information which
       concisely describes all relevant facts concerning any past, present or currently planned interest, (financial, contractual,
       organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed and bearing on whether the offeror or contractor has a possible OCI.


       If the offeror or Contractor does not disclose any relevant facts concerning an OCI, the offeror or Contractor, by submitting an offer or
       signing the contract, warrants that to its best knowledge and belief, no such facts exist relevant to possible OCI.


       It is not the intention of DOL to exclude a Contractor from a competitive acquisition due to a perceived OCI.  DOL Contracting Officers
       are fully empowered to evaluate each potential OCI scenario based upon the applicable facts and circumstances.  The final determination
       of such action may be negotiated between the impaired Contractor and the DOL Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer’s business
       judgment and sound discretion in identifying, negotiating, and eliminating OCI scenarios should not adversely affect DOL’s policy for
       competition.  DOL is committed to working with potential vendors to eliminate or mitigate actual and perceived OCI situations, without
       detriment to the integrity of the competitive process, the mission of DOL, or the legitimate business interests of the vendor community.


       Mitigation plans:  The successful Contractor will be required to permit a Government audit of internal OCI mitigation procedures for
       verification purposes.  DOL reserves the right to reject a mitigation plan, if in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, such a plan is
       not in the best interest of DOL.  After award, DOL will review and audit OCI mitigation plans as needed (in the event of any changes due
       to mergers, consolidations, or any unanticipated circumstances that may create an unacceptable organizational conflict of interest).

H.25   PERSONNEL IDENTIFICATION VERIFICATION

A.  52.204-9  Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

      (1)  The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures that implement HSPD-12, OMB guidance M-05- 24, and
   FIPS Pub 201.

      (2)  The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have physical access to a Federally
   controlled facility or access to a Federal information system.

B.  DOL Procedures for Personnel Identity Verification (PIV) of Contractor Employees Performing Under Department of Labor Contracts.

   (1)  For all new contract employees being assigned to on a DOL controlled facility for more than 6 months or who will have access to a DOL
   information system, the contractor shall follow the DOL Procedures DOL Policy For PIV Card Issuance For New Federal Employees and Contractors
   (HR/SC 10/25/05 revised 12/01/05) para E.2.  For further information on DOL Policy For PIV Card Issuance For New Federal Employees and
   Contractors (HR/SC 10/25/05 revised 12/01/05) please see Security Attachment No. 1.

      (2)  The contractor shall notify the COTR of a new employee meeting the criteria requiring a PIV five days before the report day.  If
   notification can not occur in 5 days – the contract shall include a brief explanation as to why when they submit the notification and mark it
   for expedited handling.
                       
        3) The contractor shall-


           a. Determine the level of security required for the employee, working with the COTR.
           b. Ensure they have all required documents and approvals from the COTR.
           c. Obtain the location for PIV processing and coordinate with the COTR the time of reporting so an escort can be arranged.
           d. Have the employee report, with all required documents to the reporting location determined by the COTR.

Upon submission of required PIV documents, the employee will be granted temporary access.  If the required forms are not submitted, no access
will be granted and no claim against the Government will occur.


C.        CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE SUITABILITY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

  (1) Background Investigations
 
   a. Background Investigation Requirements.  The investigation requirements for contractor employees are based on the risk or sensitivity level
designation of the position.  The Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, or other DOL Agency's designated official
informs the Contractor of the risk or sensitivity level for each contractor employee position.  The minimum level of investigation for each risk
or sensitivity level is indicated below.
 
Position Risk/Sensitivity Level:                          Minimum Investigation Requirement:
 
Low Risk/Non-sensitive                                      National Agency Check & Inquiries (NACI)
Moderate Risk                                                     Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
High Risk                                                             Background Investigation (BI)
Noncritical-Sensitive                                           Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)*
Critical-Sensitive                                                Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI)*

  * Individuals occupying Critical-Sensitive positions (i.e., require Top Secret security clearances) are subject to reinvestigation every 5
years.  Individuals occupying Noncritical-Sensitive positions are subject to reinvestigation every 10 years for Secret security clearances and
every 15 years for Confidential security clearances.
 
   b. Conducting Background Investigations.  All contract employees require a background investigation.  The Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) will conduct background investigations for DOL employees and contractor employees. Since OPM only accepts requests from Federal agencies
to conduct background investigations, the DOL Agency will make arrangements with the Contractor to send the contractor employee's completed
papers to the DOL Agency for submission to OPM.
 
   c. Payment for Background Investigation.  If the DOL Agency bears the cost for background investigations on contractor employees, the
designated DOL Agency official will forward the required documents to OPM.  If the Contractor bears the cost of the investigations,
 
 (2)  The Investigation Process
 
 The Contractor shall submit written procedures to the designated DOL Agency official describing the method by which the following investigation
requirements will be satisfied.
 
   a. Pre-employment Checks.  Before a contractor employee can begin work for DOL, he or she must provide the Contractor with a properly
completed OMB Form-3206, Declaration for Federal Employment, on which the employee has completed items 1 through 7c, questions 9 through 13, and
item 16 as necessary, and  has signed item 17.  (Security Attachment No. 2 is a copy of the OMB Form-3206.  This form can also be found at the
following website: http://www.opm.gov/forms.)  If the Contractor has not received a completed OMB Form-3206 from the contractor employee within
5 days after requesting the form, the Contractor shall notify.
 
   If the person answers "Yes" to one or more of questions 9 through 13, the Contractor shall notify immediately.  The designated DOL Agency
official will inform the Contractor whether or not the contractor employee may work on the contract.  Before making this decision the designated
DOL Agency official may also require a pre-employment FBI fingerprint check on contract employees.  This procedure is described in Chapter 2,
Section 6.
 
   b. Submission of Investigation Documents.  The Contractor shall submit the required documents below to the designated DOL Agency official
within 14 calendar days of each contractor employee's placement on the contract in a High Risk, Moderate Risk, Low Risk, or Noncritical-
Sensitive position.  However, the Single Scope Background Investigation must be completed before the contractor employee is placed in a Critical-
Sensitive position, unless the Department approves the placement of the contractor employee's placement in the position before the investigation
is completed.  The specific form that he or she completes depends on the risk or sensitivity level of the work that he or she will perform. 
These forms can be found on the following website: http://www.opm.gov/forms.
 
 Â· The SF-85, Questionnaire for Nonsensitive Positions, is used with positions or work that are designated at the Low Risk level.  The minimum
investigation required is a National Agency Check and Inquiries.
 
 Â·  The SF-85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, is used with positions or work that are designated at the Moderate or High Risk
level.  The minimum investigation required for the Moderate Risk level is a Minimum Background Investigation.  The minimum investigation
required for the High Risk level is a Background Investigation.
 
 Â· The SF-86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, is used with positions or work that are designated at the Noncritical-Sensitive or
Critical-Sensitive level.  The minimum investigation for Noncritical-Sensitive work is a Minimum Background Investigation.  The minimum
investigation for Critical-Sensitive work is a Single Scope Background Investigation.
 
 The Contractor shall also ensure that each contractor employee is fingerprinted using Form FD-258.  The Contractor can get copies of this form
from:

http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cjisd/pdf/fpcardb.pdf#search=%22FD%20258%22
 
 The Contractor shall submit the following completed forms and documents for each contractor employee based on the risk or sensitivity level of
work that such employee is performing:
 
  Low Risk:                                     High/Moderate Risk:                   Critical/Noncritical Sensitive:
 
  SF-85                                            SF-85P                                          SF-86
  FD-258                                          FD-258                                          FD-258
  OF-306                                          OF-306                                          OF-306
  Application/Resume                      Application/resume                       Application/resume

  c. Temporary Contractor Employees.  If the contractor employee is assigned to Low Risk work and is employed on a seasonal, daily, or
intermittent basis, or for no more than 180 days, the NACI is not required.  However, the Contractor shall submit the fingerprints of the
contractor employee on a Form FD-258.
 
 (3) Adjudication
 
   a. Referral of Suitability Issues.  When OPM has completed the contractor employee's background investigation, it shall send the report of
investigation to the Department's Office of Executive Resources and Personnel Security (OERPS).  If the report contains suitability issues, the
OERPS will forward the report to the designated DOL Agency official for review and adjudication.
 
   b. Suitability Standard and Criteria.  The suitability standard and criteria are described in Chapter 3, Section 3.
 
   c. Unfavorable Suitability Determination.  If the designated DOL Agency official determines that the contractor employee is unsuitable, the
Contracting Officer will inform the Contractor in writing that the contractor employee is denied access to DOL facilities and/or information and
information systems.  If revoking access to DOL facilities and/or information and information systems negatively impacts the contractor
employee's ability to perform, he or she shall be removed from the contract.  Any removal of a contractor employee shall not be considered
grounds for a delay or adjustment claim from the Contractor.

 (4) Non-disclosure Agreement

The Contractor shall require each contractor employee to review and sign the attached non-disclosure agreement (Security Attachment No. 3) when
he or she begins work on the DOL contract.

   (a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the
individuals or activities designated in the Schedule. Such orders may be issued from the effective date of the contract through the end of the
effective period.

   (b) All delivery orders or task orders are subject to the terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of conflict between a delivery
order or task order and this contract, the contract shall control.

 I.9  52.219-28  POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (APR 2009)


   (a) Definitions. As used in this clause-

   Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that

   Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of
operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size
standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is "not dominant in its field of operation" when it does not exercise a controlling or
major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In determining
whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial
resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales
territory, and nature of business activity.

   (b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its
size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the
following:

     (1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if
the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

     (2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to
include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

     (3) For long-term contracts-

       (i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

       (ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.

   (c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that
corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard
corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.

   (d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a
construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

   (e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this
clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the
Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the
contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and
provide the date of the validation or update.

   (f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is
not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

   (g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code
applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office,
along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

   The Contractor represents that it [ ] is, [ ] is not a small business concern under NAICS Code  assigned to contract number .

 [Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title].


I.10  52.222-42  STATEMENT OF EQUIVALENT RATES FOR FEDERAL HIRES  (MAY 1989)


   In compliance with the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, and the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4), this clause
identifies the classes of service employees expected to be employed under the contract and states the wages and fringe benefits payable to each
if they were employed by the contracting agency subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5341 or 5332.


      This Statement is for Information Only:
      It is not a Wage Determination

   Employee Class                   Monetary Wage-Fringe Benefits

Computer Systems Analyst I              $27.63 (see note 1)
Computer Systems Analyst II             $27.63 (see note 1)
Computer Systems Analyst III      $27.63 (see note 1)


 I.13  52.222-43  FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT AND SERVICE CONTRACT ACT - PRICE ADJUSTMENT (MULTIPLE YEAR AND OPTION CONTRACTS)  (NOV 2006)


   (a)  This clause applies to both contracts subject to area prevailing wage determinations and contracts subject to collective bargaining
agreements.

   (b)  The Contractor warrants that the prices in this contract do not include any allowance for any contingency to cover increased costs for
which adjustment is provided under this clause.

   (c)  The wage determination, issued under the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.), by the Administrator, Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, current on the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or
the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract.  If no such determination has been made applicable to this contract,
then the Federal minimum wage as established by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, (29 U.S.C. 206) current on
the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract.

   (d)  The contract price or contract unit price labor rates will be adjusted to reflect the Contractor's actual increase or decrease in
applicable wages and fringe benefits to the extent that the increase is made to comply with or the decrease is voluntarily made by the
Contractor as a result of:

     (1)  The Department of Labor wage determination applicable on the anniversary date of the multiple year contract, or at the beginning of
the renewal option period.  For example, the prior year wage determination required a minimum wage rate of $4.00 per hour. The Contractor chose
to pay $4.10.  The new wage determination increases the minimum rate to $4.50 per hour.  Even if the Contractor voluntarily increases the rate
to $4.75 per hour, the allowable price adjustment is $.40 per hour;

     (2)  An increased or decreased wage determination otherwise applied to the contract by operation of law; or

     (3)  An amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that is enacted after award of this contract, affects the minimum wage, and
becomes applicable to this contract under law.

   (e)  Any adjustment will be limited to increases or decreases in wages and fringe benefits as described in paragraph (d) of this clause, and
the accompanying increases or decreases in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but shall not otherwise
include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.

   (f)  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any increase claimed under this clause within 30 days after receiving a new wage
determination unless this notification period is extended in writing by the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor shall promptly notify the
Contracting Officer of any decrease under this clause, but nothing in the clause shall preclude the Government from asserting a claim within the
period permitted by law.  The notice shall contain a statement of the amount claimed and any relevant supporting data, including payroll
records, that the Contracting Officer may reasonably require.  Upon agreement of the parties, the contract price or contract unit price labor
rates shall be modified in writing.  The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment and
its effective date.

   (g)  The Contracting Officer or an authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books,
documents, papers and records of the Contractor until the expiration of 3 years after final payment under the contract.



 I.14  52.232-7  PAYMENTS UNDER TIME-AND-MATERIALS AND LABOR-HOUR CONTRACTS  (FEB 2007)


     The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of vouchers approved by the Contracting Officer or the authorized
representative:

   (a) Hourly rate.

     (1) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor
category specified in the contract that are--

       (i) Performed by the Contractor;

       (ii) Performed by the subcontractors; or

       (iii) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common control.

     (2) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the Schedule by the number of direct labor
hours performed.

     (3) The hourly rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.
Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is
performed by employees that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.

     (4) The hourly rates shall include wages, indirect costs, general and administrative expense, and profit. Fractional parts of an hour shall
be payable on a prorated basis.

     (5) Vouchers may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer), to the Contracting
Officer or authorized representative. The Contractor shall substantiate vouchers (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly
rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment and by--

       (i) Individual daily job timekeeping records;

       (ii) Records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; or

       (iii) Other substantiation approved by the Contracting Officer.

     (6) Promptly after receipt of each substantiated voucher, the Government shall, except as otherwise provided in this contract, and subject
to the terms of paragraph (e) of this clause, pay the voucher as approved by the Contracting Officer or authorized representative.

     (7) Unless otherwise prescribed in the Schedule, the Contracting Officer may unilaterally issue a contract modification requiring the
Contractor to withhold amounts from its billings until a reserve is set aside in an amount that the Contracting Officer considers necessary to
protect the Government's interests. The Contracting Officer may require a withhold of 5 percent of the amounts due under paragraph (a) of this
clause, but the total amount withheld for the contract shall not exceed $50,000. The amounts withheld shall be retained until the Contractor
executes and delivers the release required by paragraph (g) of this clause.

     (8) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having
performed work on an overtime basis. If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and overtime work is approved in advance by the
Contracting Officer, overtime rates shall be negotiated. Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the
Disputes clause of this contract. If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to
the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.

   (b) Materials.

     (1) For the purposes of this clause--

       (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection
with the furnishing of the end product or service.

       (ii) Materials means--

         (A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Contractor under a common
control;

         (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract;

         (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer
usage charges, etc.); and

         (D) Applicable indirect costs.

     (2) If the Contractor furnishes its own materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such
materials shall not exceed the Contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--

       (i) Quantities being acquired; and

       (ii) Actual cost of any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.

     (3) Except as provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for allowable cost of materials
provided the Contractor--

       (i) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or

       (ii) Ordinarily makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such
payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

     (4) Payment for materials is subject to the Allowable Cost and Payment clause of this contract. The Contracting Officer will determine
allowable costs of materials in accordance with Subpart 31.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in effect on the date of this contract.

     (5) The Contractor may include allocable indirect costs and other direct costs to the extent they are--

       (i) Comprised only of costs that are clearly excluded from the hourly rate;

       (ii) Allocated in accordance with the Contractor's written or established accounting practices; and

       (iii) Indirect costs are not applied to subcontracts that are paid at the hourly rates.

     (6) To the extent able, the Contractor shall--

       (i) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and

       (ii) Take all cash and trade discounts, rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, commissions, and other benefits. When unable to take
advantage of the benefits, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer and give the reasons. The Contractor shall give credit
to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that have accrued to the benefit of the
Contractor, or would have accrued except for the fault or neglect of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not deduct from gross costs the
benefits lost without fault or neglect on the part of the Contractor, or lost through fault of the Government.

     (7) Except as provided for in 31.205-26(e) and (f), the Government will not pay profit or fee to the prime Contractor on materials.

   (c) If the Contractor enters into any subcontract that requires consent under the clause at 52.244-2, Subcontracts, without obtaining such
consent, the Government is not required to reimburse the Contractor for any costs incurred under the subcontract prior to the date the
Contractor obtains the required consent. Any reimbursement of subcontract costs incurred prior to the date the consent was obtained shall be at
the sole discretion of the Government.

   (d) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price
set forth in the Schedule, and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations
under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material
costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued,
will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of
the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this
contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater
or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price
for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performing this contract, the Government has
reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price,
the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the
contract.

   (e) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and
the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and
until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised
ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in
the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the
increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling
price.

   (f) Audit. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may request audit of the vouchers and supporting
documentation. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding vouchers, that are found by the
Contracting Officer or authorized representative not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to
increase for underpayments. Upon receipt and approval of the voucher designated by the Contractor as the "completion voucher" and supporting
documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract (including, without limitation, terms relating to patents
and the terms of paragraph (g) of this clause), the Government shall promptly pay any balance due the Contractor. The completion voucher, and
supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract,
but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.

   (g) Assignment and Release of Claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at
the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under
this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims
arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions:

     (1) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible of exact statement by the Contractor.

     (2) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of
performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives
notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor
that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.

     (3) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against
patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.

   (h) Interim payments on contracts for other than services.

     (1) Interim payments made prior to the final payment under the contract are contract financing payments. Contract financing payments are
not subject to the interest penalty provisions of the Prompt Payment Act.

     (2) The designated payment office will make interim payments for contract financing on the 30TH day after the designated billing office
receives a proper payment request. In the event that the Government requires an audit or other review of a specific payment request to ensure
compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the designated payment office is not compelled to make payment by the specified due
date.

   (i) Interim payments on contracts for services. For interim payments made prior to the final payment under this contract, the Government will
make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.


 I.15  52.232-19  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS (APR 1984)


   Funds are not presently available for this contract.  The Government’s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of
appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may
arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability,
to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

   (b) The Government bears no responsibility for repair or replacement of any lost, damaged or destroyed Government property. If any or all of
the Government property is lost, damaged or destroyed or becomes no longer usable, the Contractor shall be responsible for replacement of the
property at Contractor expense. The Contractor shall have title to all replacement property and shall continue to be responsible for contract
performance.

   (c) Unless the Contracting Officer determines otherwise, the Government abandons all rights and title to unserviceable and scrap property
resulting from contract performance. Upon notification to the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall remove such property from the Government
premises and dispose of it at Contractor expense.

   (d) Except as provided in this clause, Government property furnished under this contract shall be governed by the Government Property clause
of this contract.

   (e) Government property provided under this clause:

         the accomplishment of assigned tasks:

              3. Miscellaneous minor office services to include telephone answering and message taking.




 I.17  52.249-14  EXCUSABLE DELAYS  (APR 1984)


   (a) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the Contractor shall not be in default because of any failure to perform this contract
under its terms if the failure arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of these

floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In each instance, the
failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. "Default" includes failure to make progress
in the work so as to endanger performance.

   (b) If the failure to perform is caused by the failure of a subcontractor at any tier to perform or make progress, and if the cause of the
failure was beyond the control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either, the Contractor shall not
be deemed to be in default, unless--

     (1) The subcontracted supplies or services were obtainable from other sources;

     (2) The Contracting Officer ordered the Contractor in writing to purchase these supplies or services from the other source; and

     (3) The Contractor failed to comply reasonably with this order.

   (c) Upon request of the Contractor, the Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and extent of the failure. If the Contracting Officer
determines that any failure to perform results from one or more of the causes above, the delivery schedule shall be revised, subject to the
rights of the Government under the termination clause of this contract.

Past performance information concerning subcontractors and teaming partners cannot be disclosed to a private party without the subcontractor's
or teaming partner's consent.  Because a prime contractor is a private party, the Government will need that consent before disclosing
subcontractor past performance information to the prime during exchanges.  In an effort to assist the Government's Performance Confidence
Assessment Group (PCAG) in assessing your past performance relevancy and confidence, we request that the following consent form be completed by
the major subcontractors identified in your proposal.  The completed consent forms should be submitted as part of your Past Performance Volume.

      Those pages that exceed the page counts for each volume or attachment will not be evaluated.  If there are more than forty-five (45) lines
      of text on any page, the sum of the additional lines will be removed from back to front of the particular volume or attachment and will not
      be evaluated.


   d. Content Requirements.  All information shall be confined to the appropriate volume.  The offeror shall confine submissions to essential
   matters, sufficient to define the proposal details, in a concise manner, to permit a complete and accurate evaluation of each proposal.  Each
   volume of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Summary Section and the Narrative discussion.  The Summary Section shall contain
   a brief abstract of the volume.  Proprietary information shall be clearly marked.  The following shall be included in the Narrative
   discussion:

(i) VOLUME I –TECHNICAL APPROACH.  General Requirements:
The offeror shall submit a technical proposal which addresses the offeror’s capabilities and approach to meeting the requirements contained in
the Statement of Work (SOW) in sufficient detail for each factor to be evaluated. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical
Proposal.  Redacted proposal copies must be completely redacted of all identifying information.  Failure to submit properly redacted copies may
result in the offeror being excluded from further consideration.

Sub-factor 1: Understanding of the Requirements. The offeror’s proposal shall demonstrate their understanding of the specific requirements and
the overall scope of work required and the offeror’s technical capability to perform the work including an identification of risks/mitigation
strategies.

Sub-factor 2: Personnel. The offeror shall submit a proposal which reflects the experience and qualifications of contractor personnel. The
offeror’s proposal shall include resumes for proposed key personnel and also provide a matrix to include the background/experience of the
company’s proposed personnel mapped to the appropriate SOW tasking that supports the proposed labor category and level.

Sub-factor 3: Corporate Experience. The offeror shall submit a summary of work experience of a similar nature, scope, complexity, and difficulty
to that which will be performed under the prospective contract contemplated by this solicitation.

Sub-factor 4:  Start-Up Plan. The offeror shall be responsible for providing a start-up plan with his proposal, which includes:

a) A Start-up Plan which clearly demonstrates a reasonable, realistic approach for assuming full contractual responsibility without disruption
or degradation.

b) Identifies risk and proposes appropriate mitigation strategies.

c) Proposes a realistic, achievable, and affordable start-up schedule and staffing plan.  It is anticipated that funding will be available to
cover 15 days of overlap between the old and new contract.  Only key personnel will be allowed to work during the overlap period.  Key personnel
are listed in the table under Section H.18.

d) Ensures sufficient resources are on hand and available to begin work on the effort.

e) Offers an approach to ensure the availability of trained and qualified personnel.

f) Phase-Out Plan which enables a smooth transition to replacement services when the contract ends (including technical data rights
considerations).

g) A staffing plan.

Sub-factor 5:  Quality Control Plan.  The offeror shall submit a Quality Control Plan (QCP) that details how they intend to monitor, inspect,
and correct deficiencies for the requirements of the SOW.  The Government reserves the right to incorporate the QCP in the contract that will
result from this solicitation.  If the QCP is incorporated into the resulting contract, the QCP will no longer be considered proprietary and
will be considered releasable under FOIA.

(ii) VOLUME II – PAST PERFORMANCE.

The offeror shall submit past performance of three contracts for current relevancy (3 years) based on how well the contractor performed on
projects of similar dollar value, scope, and complexity of work in the SOW.  Offerors are advised that the Government may use past performance
information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the offeror and the information
obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision.  The absence of past performance data will be rated
neither favorably nor unfavorably.    Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sectors.  For
contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account information regarding the past performance of
predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance, or subcontractors that will perform key aspects of the requirement.  The
Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire, Attachment 1.  Offeror shall distribute
the questionnaire included in the solicitation as an attachment to their references so the form can be completed and submitted directly to the
Government.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M.1  NOTICE LISTING SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

       The following solicitation provisions pertinent to this section are hereby incorporated by reference (by Citation Number, Title, and
Date) in accordance with the FAR provision at FAR 52.252-1  SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE in Section L of this solicitation.
See FAR 52.252-1 for an internet address (if specified) for electronic access to the full text of a provision.


      NUMBER     TITLE DATE

      52.217-5   EVALUATION OF OPTIONS  JUL 1990



 M.2  METHOD OF AWARD


Basis for Award:  The Government will award a single Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract from this solicitation to the responsible
offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government based on the best overall proposal that is determined
to be the most beneficial to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the three evaluation factors:  {Technical, Past
Performance, and Price}.  Factor I, Technical is significantly more important than Factor II, Past Performance. All sub-factors under Factor I,
Technical are of equal importance.

The non-Price factors combined are more important than Factor III, Price.  However, price will become significantly more important as non-price
factors approach equality.  Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is
more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government.  However, the
Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. To
receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than “Acceptable” must be achieved for each evaluation factor or subfactor.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should
contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if
later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public
interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:  The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in  terms  of  program  commitments,
including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, such  that  the  proposal
is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.

Correction Potential of Proposals:  The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the “correction potential” of any deficiency or
uncertainty.  The judgment of such “correction potential” is within the sole discretion of the Government.  If an aspect of an Offeror’s
proposal not meeting the Government’s requirements is not considered correctable, the Offeror may be eliminated from further consideration for
award.

M.3      EVALUATION OF TECHNICAL PROPOSAL

FACTOR I:  TECHNICAL:


SUB-FACTOR 1- UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT – The Government will evaluate the offeror’s understanding of the work to be performed in
accordance with the SOW.  The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in the SOW, particularly
Part 5,  the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated, and the extent to which the offeror is capable to perform.

SUB-FACTOR 2- PERSONNEL - The Government will evaluate the experience and qualifications of all contractor personnel, to include resumes for key
personnel and also provide a matrix to include the background/experience of the company’s proposed personnel mapped to the appropriate SOW
tasking that supports the proposed labor category and level.


SUB-FACTOR 3 – CORPORATE EXPERIENCE - The Government will evaluate the offeror’s experience with work of a similar nature, scope, complexity,
and difficulty to determine whether it demonstrates proficiency within the type of problems that could be encountered under this award.


SUB-FACTOR 4 – START-UP AND PHASE OUT PLAN - The Government will evaluate  the Start-Up Plan on how reasonable and realistic the approach is for
assuming full contractual responsibility without disruption or degradation of performance.  The plan will be evaluated on whether sufficient
resources are on hand and available to begin work under this requirement, and will also be evaluated on how well risks are identified and the
likelihood of successful mitigation using the proposed strategies.  The plan will be evaluated on whether sufficient resources are on hand and
available to begin work under this requirement, and with a statement that the personnel proposed are available, trained, and qualified to
perform the work under this effort.  In addition the government will evaluate the Phase-Out Plan submitted by the offeror based on how it
demonstrates the offeror’s ability to enable a smooth transition to replacement services when the contract period of performance ends.  The plan
shall provide phase-in support for up to 90 days to the selected contractor if the incumbent contractor is not selected.


Contractors are required to submit their staffing plan with their proposal or their proposal will be considered non-responsive.


SUB-FACTOR 5:  QUALITY CONTROL PLAN - The Government will evaluate how the offeror intends to monitor, inspect, and correct deficiencies for the
requirements of the SOW.  The Government shall incorporate the QCP in the contract that will result from this solicitation.  The QCP will no
longer be considered proprietary and will be considered releasable under FOIA.

M.4      EVALUATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE

FACTOR II:  PAST PERFORMANCE: The Government will evaluate past performance of 3 current or previous contracts for relevancy (3 years) based  on
how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollar value, scope, and complexity. Offerors are advised that the Government  may  use
past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the offeror and the
information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision.  The absence of  past  performance  data
will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably.  Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or  private  sectors.
For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account information regarding the past performance  of
predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance, or subcontractors that will perform key aspects of  the  requirement.   The
Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire.

The past performance evaluation will be accomplished through  assignment  of  a  confidence  assessment  rating  on  a  combination  of  recency,
relevancy, reliability and quality of performance. Although the past performance evaluation focuses  on  performance  that  is  relevant  to  the
Technical Ability/Approach sub factors,  the  resulting  Performance  Confidence  Assessment  represents  an  overall  evaluation  of  contractor
performance.

Under the Past Performance factor, the Performance Confidence Assessment represents the evaluation of an Offeror’s present and past  work  record
to assess the Government's confidence in the Offeror’s probability of successfully performing as proposed.   The  Government  will  evaluate  the
Offeror's demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying services that meet the user's needs, including but not limited to,  controlling
costs, adhering to schedules (including the administrative aspects of performance), and performance  (reasonable  and  cooperative  behavior  and
commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally, the contractor’s business-like concern for the interest of the customer).

Past performance information to be evaluated will include the Offerors’ records of providing high-quality services; standards of good technical
and analytic workmanship; adherence to contract schedules; administrative aspects of contract performance; quality, availability and stability
of personnel and commitment to customer’s mission/goals.  The evaluation will be constrained to the most recent and relevant contracts for a
comprehensive review.

Recent:  In order to be considered recent, the services must have been provided within the last three years from the date of solicitation
release.

If an Offeror has no single project that encompasses all types of the required experience, the Offeror may:  (i) Show relevant experience
through a combination of projects that together show that work has been accomplished that is consistent in scope and complexity with the SOW;
(ii) Show relevant experience through personnel who are proposed to work on the contract that have had the required experience with another
company.

Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated
favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive a "Unknown Confidence" rating for the Past Performance factor.  For
Offerors with no relevant performance record, the Government may consider relevant performance information regarding key personnel.

Adverse past performance is considered any rating below Satisfactory on any questionnaire, survey or Government evaluation referenced in
paragraph 2.1.3.2.  Offerors with adverse past performance will be afforded an opportunity to address alleged deficiencies, if the Offeror has
not already been provided an opportunity to comment on the deficiencies in accordance with FAR 15.306(a)(2) and FAR 15.306(b)(4).  Where
relevant performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the
appropriateness and effectiveness of any implemented corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).  The Government may review more
recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.

Quality of Performance:  Assesses how well the Offeror performed.  This will be assessed based on the ratings received in the Past Performance
Questionnaires and other sources.

M.5   EVALUATION OF PRICE PROPOSALS

FACTOR III:  – PRICE: The Government will evaluate price for this procurement will be pursuant to determining best value.  However, as the other
assessments of the Offerors become more equal cost may become a determining factor in award selection.

The Offeror’s submission for Volume 3, Price, will be evaluated as follows:

The Government will review the Pricing submissions for completeness and accuracy.

A price reasonableness review will be conducted for all Offerors.  For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government
that a prudent person would pay when consideration is given to prices in the market.  Normally, price reasonableness is established through
adequate price competition, but may also be determined through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is
not unbalanced.  Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2).

Non-Price Factors:  The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor
listed first:

Factor I, Technical is significantly more important than Factor II, Past Performance, which when combined, are significantly more important than
Factor III “Price”.  However, as offerors ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor III “Price” becomes significantly more
important in the award decision.

 (a) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.
