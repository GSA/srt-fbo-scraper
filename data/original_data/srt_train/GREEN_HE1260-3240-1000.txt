EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the lowest price technically acceptable responsible offeror.

Technical Capability: Acceptable: The offeror shall have the ability to accomplish all of the performance requirements and standards of the performance work statement. Unacceptable: Proposal does not clearly meet the requirements of the solicitation. ii. Past Performance: Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. If no record or sparse record, the contractor will not be marked favorably or unfavorably. A rating of unacceptable for any factor will result in an overall Technically Unacceptable rating. Offerors found technically acceptable will then be evaluated for price. Prices will be evaluated to determine fair & reasonableness. To calculate the offeror's total price proposal, the government will add the subtotals of all CLINS for base and option years. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The questions are answered after the proposal is due?  A1.  The solicitation should read "questions will be answered after 25 November 2013." The solicitation  has been amended to make this correction.    Q2.  On the excel spreadsheet there is a cell labeled QTY. Does this represent the number of videos  that will be submitted during the base year for that particular CLIN?   Ex.

The quantity listed in attachment 2 ­ price proposal sheet, represents the government's maximum  quantity in the specified unit of issue for each CLIN for each year.  Task orders will be issued for specific  requirements.     Q3.  Is this a new opportunity?  A3.  Yes    Q4.  Is it setaside or does it have a setaside preference?   A4.  This is being solicited full and open.  No setaside.  FAR Part 19 rules for small business setaside do  not apply to procurements outside of the United States.
