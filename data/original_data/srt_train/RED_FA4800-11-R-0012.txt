____________________________________________________________________________________



ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:



HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.59 per hour or $143.60 per week or $622.27 per month



VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or

successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service

includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or

successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the

performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)



HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther

King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor

Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A

contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in

accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)







THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:



1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does

not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,

administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because

most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate

not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per

week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.

400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations

within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not

list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey

data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds

$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For

example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties

within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer

occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,

then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the

conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage

determination.



Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer

industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer

professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees

who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:

    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including

consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional

specifications;

    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or

modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and

related to user or system design specifications;

    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer

programs related to machine operating systems; or

    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which

requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).



2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you

work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential

and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.

 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your

regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday

premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime

(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered

overtime work).





HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees

employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or

in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This

includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive

ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder

and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.

  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations

on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations

involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.



A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that

represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to

ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials

which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the

employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the

like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.

All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and

incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials

are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for

ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.



** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **



If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract

(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or

local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an

employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage

determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the

following standards as compliance:



The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an

adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual

cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made

the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to

this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining

agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary

affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning

and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in

those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"

materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do

not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial

laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms

of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,

there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.



The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the

"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,

unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A

links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.

gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at

http://wdol.gov/.



REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form

1444 (SF 1444)}



Conformance Process:



The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is

not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to

be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage

determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable

relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted

classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such

conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the

fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by

the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)

of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall

be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}

When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444

should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be

conformed.



The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:



1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed

occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).



2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order

proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each

proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage

rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the

authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized

representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the

contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees

performs any contract work.



3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report

of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent

information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage

and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,

for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).



4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or

disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or

notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process

the request.



5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.



6) The contractor informs the affected employees.



Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.



When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of

Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure

that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the

wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that

determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.

Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide

classifications listed in the wage determination.

            Past performance information from commercial sources, or concerning subcontractors and teaming partners cannot be disclosed to a
      third party or private party without the subcontractor's or teaming partner's consent.  Because a prime contractor is a private party, and
      the Government is considered a third party, the Government will need that consent before disclosing contractor, subcontractor/teaming
      partner past and present performance information to the prime or to the Government during exchanges.  In an effort to assist the
      Government's Performance Confidence Assessment Group (PCAG) in assessing your past performance relevancy and confidence, we request that
      the following consent form be completed by the major contractor, subcontractors/teaming partners identified in your proposal.  The

1.0. PURPOSE



1.1. This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan has been developed to provide the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) an effective and systematic method to evaluate contractor provided services as required by the terms and conditions of the contract.  This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan implements the requirements of Air Force Instruction 63-124, Performance Based Service Acquisitions (PBSA), with respect to the government’s quality assurance requirements.



1.2. This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan is based on the premise that the contractor is responsible for contract management and quality control actions necessary to meet the terms of the contract, not the government.  The government’s objective in having the service provided is to survey activities to provide sufficient assurance to justify acceptance/rejection of the contractor’s Flight Medicine Provider services.  Based on quality data trends, the methods of government surveillance may be changed.  Failure to provide quality services could result in termination of the contract and other monetary repercussions.  Results that the multi-functional team is striving to achieve in managing the acquisition are to assure the contractor obtains an acceptable level of performance, meets the stated qualifications, and is available to provide services according to Air Force needs.  A contract to provide the service is the best means of achieving this objective and results.



1.3. The contractor is encouraged to manage costs and resources effectively while meeting government expectations.  The government will not monitor frequencies or methods of performance, only the expected results as listed in the services summary..  This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan provides the government with an objective and recordable means for reducing the contractor’s profits for repeated non-performance.  Conversely, contractors have an incentive to utilize their resources in a cost effective manner to increase profit.

1.4. This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan describes the method(s) used to evaluate contractor provided services in meeting performance objectives and performance thresholds.  CORs will use periodic, customer complaint, and 100% inspection assessment methods to evaluate the contractor’s performance.  The assessment procedures identified in this Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, with active application of the contractor’s quality control procedures, are intended to ensure acceptable contractor performance.



1.5. The role of government quality assurance is to ensure contract standards are achieved.  In conducting assessments, CORs are to be objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating contractor performance against the performance standards.



1.6. This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan is a living document and shall be revised or modified by members of the multi-functional team as circumstances warrant, throughout the life of the contract, to ensure adequate oversight of contractor performance is maintained.



2.0. MULTI-FUNCTIONAL TEAM MEMBERS AND RESPONSIBILITES.

	(Reference AFI 63-124, paragraph 2.8 for responsibilities)



	Contracting Officer (CO)

	Contract Administrator (CA)

	Quality Assurance Program Coordinator (CORC)

	COR Supervisor

	Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR)

	Contractor







3.0. SERVICES SUMMARY (SS):  The contract service requirements are summarized in performance objectives that relate directly to mission essential items.  The performance threshold briefly describes the minimally acceptable levels of service required for each requirement.  The SS and the contractor’s Quality Control Plan (QCP) provide information on contract requirements, the expected level of contractor performance and the expected method of government surveillance and confirmation of services provided.  These thresholds are critical to mission success.  Procedures as set forth in the FAR 52.212-4 (a), Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, Inspection/Acceptance, will be used to remedy all deficiencies.  





3.1. Assessment Schedule.



3.1.1. The COR will develop a monthly surveillance schedule based on this Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan’s requirements.  A locally devised form may be used.  The schedule shall be completed no later than 7 calendar days before the beginning of the period it covers.  Copies of the surveillance schedule shall be provided to the Contracting Officer before the start of the surveillance period.  Surveillance schedules, when completed, shall be marked “For Official Use Only”, and shall not be shown to the contractor.



3.1.2. Changes to the surveillance schedule shall be posted promptly.  Copies of the changed schedule shall be sent to the Contracting Officer.  The COR shall document the reason(s) for changes of the surveillance schedule, and maintain the documentation in the COR files with the corresponding changed surveillance schedule.



3.2. Assessment of Services Summary (SS) Items.



3.2.1. It is essential for the CORs to conduct surveillance in accordance with the projected surveillance schedule for an effective quality assurance program. Mission requirements may require deviations from the surveillance schedule.  Surveillance should be performed as close to the schedule as is practicable.  The COR shall document the surveillance as it is conducted.



3.2.2. The COR shall conduct surveillance of the contractor’s performance by determining whether or not the performance meets the standards contained in the contract, the PWS and the SS items.



3.2.2.1. The COR must inspect by physically checking an attribute of the completed task, checking a management information report, or otherwise inspecting the task results to determine whether or not performance meets the standards contained in the PWS.    



3.2.3. Re-Performance. The COR shall strive to have the contractor successfully re-perform all unacceptable performance, defects and customer complaints within the time allowed in the SS. The intent of the contract is to have the service provided rather than taking any reduction of payment.  However, the contractor's satisfactory re-performance of services shall be at no additional cost to the government and shall not remove the status of any defects from customer complaints, periodic or 100% surveillances, as it applies to the performance thresholds listed in the SS.

3.2.4. If the contractor challenges the validity of any customer complaint or defect annotated on a QAEC and the COR and contractor cannot come to agreement, the COR shall document the complaint/defect in question on a Performance Assessment Report (PAR) (Appendix D) and it shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer (CO) for resolution. The CO in accordance with the applicable Inspection/Acceptance clause will take action.

3.3. Periodic Surveillance. This method requires the COR to employ a “spot check” style of evaluation based on the contractor’s schedule.  Periodic surveillances will be conducted on a scheduled basis (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annually) and may be adjusted, based on quality trends.  



3.3.1. Standard. Defects identified in the periodic surveillance will be utilized in determining the contractors’ acceptable or unacceptable performance as defined in the SS. All defects noted in the surveillance will be rectified by the contractor within the time allowed in the SS. 

3.3.2. Procedures for Periodic Surveillances.  Each performance objective that has been scheduled for surveillance will be evaluated utilizing a set of evaluation factors listed on the QAEC. For each QAEC evaluation factor the contractor will receive either a pass or a fail mark. Each fail mark will correlate to a defect and will be used in determining Performance Thresholds listed on the SS in Section 3.0 of this Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan for each Performance Objective. 

3.3.3. Documentation. Periodic surveillance documentation will be accomplished utilizing the Quality Assurance Surveillance Checklist (QASC).. Documentation shall include the date, time, and location of the surveillance, applicable remarks to the surveillance, and signature of the COR. 



3.4. Customer Complaint.  This method requires the customer to fill out a Customer Complaint Record or locally generated form provided by the COR or Contracting Officer.  The COR will validate the complaint and notify the contractor of the complaint.  The contractor shall acknowledge the complaint within 2 hours and inform the COR of his recommendation.  Any deficiency shall be documented and the contractor shall re-perform service immediately, if appropriate, or within 24 hours at no increase in contract amount.  The contractor shall respond to the Customer Complaint instructions provided and return it to the COR within 5 calendar days of receipt. Any unsatisfactory inspection identified but re-performed acceptably shall still be counted as an unsatisfactory inspection for trending purposes.



3.4.1. Standard. Failing to meet the performance threshold as outlined in the SS for any of these performance objectives in any one month period shall result in a warning or letter of concern from the Contracting Officer.



3.4.1.1. Failing to meet the performance threshold as outlined in the SS of these performance objectives in any combination for any two, or more, failures shall constitute an immediate Progress Meeting.  All remedies shall be in accordance with the FAR 52.212-4 (a), Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, Inspection/Acceptance.



3.4.2. Procedures for Customer Complaints. Any base personnel that observe services, either incomplete or not performed, for any contracted services, should immediately contact the COR by telephone, email, letter, or fax.  The COR will send the complainant a complaint form to fill out. The COR will then validate the complaint. If the complaint is validated, the COR will notify the contractor’s Quality Control Inspector (QCI) to pick up the written customer complaint. The QCI will be given 24 hours to correct the defect after verbal notification by the COR. If the QCI disagrees with the complaint after investigation  and challenges the validity of the complaint, the QCI will notify the COR. If the COR still believes the complaint to be valid after reinvestigation, the QCI will have to correct the defect within the given 24 hour time period. The COR shall inform the customer of the approximate time the defect will be corrected and advise the customer to contact the COR if the defect is not corrected. The COR shall follow up with the customer after scheduled re-performance to ensure the customer complaint was resolved. If the complaint is invalid, the COR shall contact the complainant and explain why the complaint was invalid. 

 3.4.3. Documentation.  Customer complaint documentation will be accomplished utilizing a Customer Complaint Form (Appendix A). The complainant’s organization, building number, name, phone number and nature of the complaint will be annotated on the form. The COR shall annotate on the form the date and time the complaint was validated and the date and time of contractor notification. The contractor will then annotate on the form the action taken to correct the defect and then sign and date the form. The COR shall then sign and date the form.

3.5. 100% Percent Inspection.  This method requires the COR to inspect the service each time it occurs.  Results shall be annotated on the inspection checklist.  The inspection will be on items identified in the Services Summary.  Any deficiency shall be documented and the contractor shall re-perform service immediately, if appropriate, or within 24 hours at no increase in contract amount.  Any unsatisfactory inspection identified but re-performed acceptably shall still be counted as an unsatisfactory inspection for trending purposes.



3.5.1. 100% Inspection Standard.  Receiving two or more unsatisfactory 100% surveillances within a 12 month period may result in unsatisfactory past performance documentation.  Continued receipt of unsatisfactory 100% surveillances during the contract period shall constitute a negative trend and the Contracting Officer may take any appropriate action in accordance with the FAR 52.212-4 (a), Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, Inspection/Acceptance.



3.5.2. 100% Inspection Procedures.  Each performance objective will be evaluated utilizing a set of evaluation factors listed on the QASC.  Each documented unacceptable performance  will correlate to a defect and will be used in determining conformance to the Performance Thresholds listed in Section 3.0 Services Summary of this Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan. 

3.5.3. 100% Inspection Documentation. 100% inspection documentation will be accomplished utilizing the QASC. Documentation shall include the date, time, location of the inspection, applicable remarks of the inspection, and signature of the COR. 

3.6. Assessment of non-SS Items.  The government has the right to inspect all services called for by the contract, to the extent practicable at all times and places during the term of the contract.  Therefore, CORs have the right to conduct assessments for SS items and non-SS items as well. When the COR identifies unacceptable performance on non-SS items, the COR shall follow the procedures in section 4.0 of this Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, entitled Unacceptable Performance.  

 

4.0. UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE



4.1. When performance is determined unacceptable due to the contractor not meeting a performance threshold identified in the SS or the COR identifies unacceptable performance on non-SS items, the COR shall issue a Performance Assessment Report (PAR) (Appendix C). The COR will annotate a brief description of the deficiency, a suspense date then sign and date the form. The COR shall notify the contractor to pick up the form to annotate concurrence or non-concurrence, corrective action, corrective action estimated completion date and how to prevent recurrence or reason for non-concurrence. The contractor shall return the form to the COR by the suspense date on the form.

   

4.2. When performance is determined unacceptable due to failure to provide adequate corrective action to preclude recurrence of government identified findings, failure to provide corrective action or re-performance of deficiencies identified by the COR within a prescribed suspense period, or any failure to adhere to security regulations that results in a security incident, the COR shall issue a Corrective Action Report (CAR) (Appendix B). The COR shall fill in the CAR by annotating the deficiency, impact to the government caused by the deficiency, suspense date and control number. The COR shall notify the contractor of the CAR and require the contractor to respond, in writing, detailing a written corrective action plan that details the corrective action of the cited deficiency, the cause of the deficiency, and actions taken to prevent recurrence, by the suspense date on the CAR. The COR shall then respond to the contractor’s corrective action plan. The COR and the COR Supervisor shall sign and date the CAR and forward the form to the Contracting Officer. 



 One Corrective Action Report issued  within a 1-month period will result in a warning

Two or more Corrective Action Reports issued within a 1-month period may result in reduction of contract price.  The Contracting Officer may reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of services performed.

Four or more Corrective Action Reports issued within a 1-month period will result in the aforementioned reduction of price per incident and could result in termination of the contract.  The contractor will meet with both the COR and Contracting Officer to decide the remedy.

4.3. Unacceptable performance re-performed by the contractor shall still count as unacceptable performance.  



4.4. The COR shall maintain a CAR log of all CARs issued to the contractor (a locally devised form may be used). The CAR log shall contain the CAR number, date issued, contractor, description of unacceptable performance, suspense date, and closeout date.  All CARs and CAR logs shall be maintained by the COR for the life of the contract. 



4.5. Contracting Officer Notification.



4.5.1. If at any time the COR identifies a “Major nonconformance”, which IAW FAR Part 46.101, means a nonconformance, other than critical, that is likely to result in failure of the supplies or services, or to materially reduce the usability of the supplies or services for their intended purpose, the COR shall document their findings and notify the Contracting Officer immediately in writing.  Email is acceptable.

   

4.5.2. When the COR identifies a “Minor nonconformance” which IAW FAR Part 46.101, means a nonconformance that is not likely to materially reduce the usability of the supplies or services for their intended purpose, or is a departure from established standards having little bearing on the effective use or operation of the supplies or services, the COR shall document the findings.  The COR is not required to notify the Contracting Officer.  However, if the same minor nonconformance is repeatedly identified, it may be an indication that a major nonconformance is occurring or has occurred because the contractor has not taken proper steps to prevent recurrence.  In this case, the COR shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing.



4.6. COR End of Month Report.  COR shall submit an assessment report (COR Monthly Report) in the form of an official memorandum on official letterhead and attach all CARs, PARs, and validated customer complaints to the CO no later than 5 working days following the month in which the actual surveillance occurred.  The report shall identify the number of surveillances scheduled and conducted, the number of unacceptable performances observed, the number of Corrective Action Reports issued, the number of Performance Assessment reports issued, the number of valid customer complaints, any significant contractor performance discrepancies, and a rating of the contractor’s overall performance.  The report shall be signed and dated by the COR Supervisor and the COR and a copy provided to the CO. Validated customer complaints and all documentation will be used to support contractor ratings in the Contractor Performance Rating System (CPARS).



4.7. Remedies for Unacceptable Performance.



4.7.1. In accordance with the contract Inspection of Services clause, if any of the services do not conform to contract requirements; the government may require the contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no increase in contract amount. This includes but is not limited to termination of contractor personnel and recruitment of substitute personnel that are equally qualified within established timeframes.  When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the government may:



4.7.1.1. Require the contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and



4.7.1.2. Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.  This may include a reduction in the number of paid hours to reflect the total non-performance period.

The contractor shall also notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, of any work being performed, if any, that the contractor considers over and above the requirements of the contract.  Appropriate action shall be taken to resolve any outstanding issues. 



6.3. Performance Feedback:  On a monthly basis, the COR will complete at minimum one (1) Performance Assessment Report on the contractor’s performance and forward it with their COR Monthly Report to the contract administrator that includes the following assessment elements.  The COR will also keep the FC informed of all performance assessments.  This information is strictly a tool to support annual contractor ratings in CPARS and provide a snapshot view of contractor’s performance.













6.3.1 Performance Ratings.  Contractor ratings and criteria are described below:





7.0. CONTRACTOR’S QUALITY CONTROL PLAN



7.1. The contractor shall establish and maintain a Quality Control Plan (QCP) to ensure the requirements of the contract are provided as specified.  The contractor shall provide a QCP describing the inspection system for the services required in the PWS.  The contractor shall develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent and ensure non-recurrence of unacceptable services.  The contractor shall update the plan as changes occur and changes shall be submitted for review and acceptance to the Contracting Officer.  The contractor’s Quality Control Plan shall contain, as a minimum, the following items:



7.1.1. A description of the inspection system to cover all services.  Description shall include specifics as to the areas to be inspected on a scheduled and unscheduled basis, frequency of inspections, and the title and organizational placement of the inspector(s). A description of the surveillance methodology used to cover all tasks and services listed on the PWS and QAEC.  Contractor quality control surveillance records shall be kept at the contractor's office and made available to the government upon request.  



7.1.2. A description of the methods to be used for identifying and preventing defects in the quality of service performed. 



7.1.3. A description of how the records will be kept.  Records must document all inspections and corrective or preventive actions taken.



7.1.4. The contractor shall establish and implement methods of making sure all keys/combinations issued to the contractor by the government are not lost or misplaced and are not used by unauthorized persons.  The contractor shall not duplicate any keys issued by the government.  If any keys are lost or misplaced, the government may replace the affected lock or locks or perform re-keying and deduct the cost of such from the monthly payment due the contractor.  In the event a master key is lost or duplicated, the government shall replace all locks and keys for that system, and the total cost deducted from the monthly payment due the contractor.

8.0. Initial Contract Performance Review and Annual Execution Review iaw AFI 63-101, Section 4, Para 4.9 & 4/10.  



8.1. Assumption of Workload Review.  All services acquisitions with a value in excess of $100,000 will be reviewed by the appropriate designated official within 30 days of the contractor’s full assumption of contract workload (for example, end of transition, phase-in, or similar event).  The purpose of the review is to determine if the contractor successfully completed transition, is fully operational, and is within other performance parameters required by the contract.  Since HQ ACC/A7K is the designated official for this contract, the Contracting Squadron Commander or DBO shall conduct and document the assumption of workload review and report to HQ ACC/A7K any negative information concerning contract execution.



8.2. Annual Performance Review.  All services with a value in excess of $100,000 will be reviewed annually.  This review is to be conducted not later than 30 days prior to issuing the notification of the government’s intent to exercise the option for the follow-on year.  Since HQ ACC/A7K is the designated official for this contract, the Contracting Squadron Commander or DBO shall conduct and document the annual performance review and report to HQ ACC/A7K any negative variations in cost, schedule and/or other significant performance measures required by the contract.  If significant variations exist, include an explanation of the causes for the variance and an assessment of the contractor’s corrective action plan.



8.3 Any significant changes in anticipated cost/price, schedule, or performance expectations are subject to a special review at the direction of the AFPEO/CM, HQ ACC/A7K, or other designated official.

Corrective Action Report (CAR) Instructions



Block 1.  Enter Contractor Name.



Block 2.  Enter Contract Number.



Block 3.  Enter Contract Name or Type of Services.



Block 4.  Enter Functional Area of the Contract.



Block 5.  Enter the assigned suspense date given the Contractor to provide a response to the CAR.  A date must be entered for a Major CAR.  A date is optional at the discretion of the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) initiating the CAR if the finding is Minor.       



Block 6.  All CARs will be tracked with a Control Number. The COR Supervisor is the Issuing Authority for his/her contract Quality Assurance Evaluators (CORs) generating CARs.  By providing the control number to the COR originating the CAR, the Issuing Authority demonstrates concurrence with the finding.  The control number will be made up of the first two letters of the name of the site or contract, the last two digits of the calendar year, and a three digit number starting with 001 and progressing upward throughout the calendar year (e.g., WP04-001).  



Block 7.

1.  Check the block that indicates whether the identified deficiency is assigned as a Major or Minor nonconformance/finding.  See Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (PP), paragraph 4.3, for the definitions of Major and Minor findings and associated explanations.    

2.  Nonconformance/Finding:  Clearly state the details of the finding followed by a reference to the stated contractual requirement.  The reference must state the portion of the contract, part, section, paragraph and subparagraph and must make a complete brief quotation of the contract reference.   

3.  State the impact that the finding has or could have on the accomplishment of the mission that the contract provides.  

4.  When determining how long to give the Contractor to respond to the identified nonconformance/finding, the normal is 10 working days.  The suspense date should reflect this unless the nonconformance/finding requires a greater amount of time to come to solution.  Major nonconformance/findings require a Contractor response.   Minor nonconformance/findings may require a Contractor response at the discretion of the COR initiating the CAR and/or the Issuing Authority. 

  

Blocks 8 and 9.  Contract CORs initiating a CAR must sign in Block 8 and the Issuing Authority signs in Block 9.  Each annotates the date at the time of signature.



Block 10.  Upon review of the Contractor's reply, the originator of the CAR will enter comments regarding acceptance or rejection of the Contractor's response.  This block may also contain any comments regarding follow-on inspections conducted or needed at a later date to validate that the finding has not reoccurred.   



Block 11.  The COR selects Accept or Reject after reviewing the Contractor's response.  



Block 12.  The COR enters a close date after advising the Issuing Authority that the Contractor's response is acceptable and the Issuing Authority concurs.  The Issuing Authority will then forward the closed CAR to the Contractor and report accordingly in the monthly Certificate Of Service (COS) or other applicable contracting officer services report.  This routing remains the same if the Contractor response is unacceptable and the CAR remains open until an acceptable response is received except that the Issuing Authority forwards the open CAR back to the Contractor for additional information.

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)(Addendum)


(a)   The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the
solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate
offers:

      1.    Past Performance
      2.    Price

Past performance is approximately equal to price when being evaluated.

(b)   BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:  This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing offerors’ past and present performance
history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations.  By submission of its offer, in accordance with the
instructions in clause 52.212-1 “Instructions to Offerors”, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and
conditions, representations and certifications, and Performance Work Statement requirements.  All offers shall be treated equally except for
their prices and performance records.  Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide
complete accompanying rationale.  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:

      1.    Initially offers shall be ranked according to price.  An offeror’s proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities
identified in the Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount for each.  The
extended amounts for each CLIN will be added to determine the overall evaluated price.  The price evaluation will document the reasonableness
and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.

      2.    Using questionnaires and other means, the contracting officer shall seek performance information on recent and relevant (as defined
in the addendum to 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors) contracts for the lowest priced offeror based on (1) the past and present efforts
provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.

      2.a. JOINT VENTURES:  Joint ventures are defined as two or more business entities that have been merged to create one business entity with
equal responsibility during the course of the contract.  In a joint venture, past performance for both businesses will be evaluated equally.

       2.b. TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS: Teaming arrangements are defined as two or more business entities that are working together under the
representation of one of the existing business entities for the duration of the contract.  A teaming arrangement is not a formal merger of two
or more business entities and offerors must identify in their offer any teaming arrangement to be considered and completely identify the
relationships/responsibilities of the teaming members.  All past performance information submitted by the teaming partners will be considered
during the evaluation process, but since only one business may represent the teaming entities, an overall past performance rating for only the
primary representing business will be assigned during the evaluation process.

      2.c.  The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory
Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence, or Unknown Confidence, as defined in Table 1 below.  Offerors with no relevant past or present
performance history shall receive the rating “Unknown Confidence”, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.

|TABLE 1 - PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS                                                                                                   |
|Rating                                      |Description                                                                                      |
|SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE                      |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror|
|                                            |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                   |
|SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE                     |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror    |
|                                            |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                   |
|LIMITED CONFIDENCE                          |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror |
|                                            |will successfully perform the required effort.                                                   |
|NO                                          |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror    |
|CONFIDENCE                                  |will be able to successfully perform the required effort.                                        |
|                                            |                                                                                                 |
|UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE                          |No performance record is identifiable or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no   |
|                                            |confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. IG 5.5.2.2                              |


      3.  If of the lowest priced offeror receives a Substantial Confidence or Satisfactory Confidence performance assessment rating, evaluation
stops and award will be made.  Also, should the lowest offeror not receive a Substantial Confidence or Satisfactory Confidence rating, the
Government will proceed to the next lowest offeror and conduct a performance confidence assessment as stated above.  This process will be
repeated in order of price from low to high until an offeror with Substantial Confidence or Satisfactory Confidence is identified.  In that
event, an integrated best value award decision shall be made.

      4.    Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions.
Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has
not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than
satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.  Communication
conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract
without the opportunity for proposal revision.

      5.    The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The government, however, reserves the
right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.

(c)   Options. There are no options in this requirement.

(d)   A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.
