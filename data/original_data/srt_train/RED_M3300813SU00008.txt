Equipment & Technology Computer Assisted Real-Time Transcription (CART)

1.1 BACKGROUND: The U.S Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Legal Services Support Section West, has a Requirement for Computer Assisted Real-Time Transcription Software that is compatible with the speech-recognition product suite, Dragon Naturally Speaking (DNS) software, currently in used. 

The Computer Assisted Real-Time Transcription (CART) is a type of technology that provides an automatic transcription of recorded words into a computer program.  Traditionally used in legal settings. CART records speech for display in a typed format that people can read on a screen.  This service is provided by a stenographer who records speech at the speed it is spoken.  This information is sent to a computer and used to enhance a stenographer’s transcription capability.



A Computer Assisted Real-Time Transcription Software is required as the Dragon Naturally Speaking software has proven to be too slow for Computer Aided Realtime Transcription (CART), captioning, courtroom realtime, or any other applications. This requirement must provide instant translation of the spoken word into English text using a stenotype machine, notebook computer and realtime software.



A software is required that, when used in conjunction with Dragon Naturally Speaking Suite, via algorithm calls to Dragon Software codes, is faster, with no drop-down delay, no results box, and no pausing, and more accurate in voice transcriptions than DNS itself.  



This required software must work in conjunction with the stenograph machine to translate raw notes instantly into a transcript.  The requirement is for one program for both stenograph writers and voice writers.
