Introduction This Statement of Work seeks support for the International Trade Administration (OCIO) in its goals of achieving compliance with the statutory requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, for access to electronic and information technology (E&IT) to persons with disabilities. 2. Background Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use E&IT, they provide those employees with disabilities comparable access as those without disabilities unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. E&IT includes any equipment or interconnected subsystem of equipment that is used in the creation, conversion or duplication of data or information. This includes computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services), telecommunication products (e.g. telephones), information kiosks, transaction machines, websites, multimedia products, and office equipment (e.g. copiers and fax machines). The United States Access Board is responsible for developing accessibility standards for E&IT, for incorporation into regulations that govern Federal procurement practices. On December 21, 2000, the Board issued accessibility standards for electronic and information technology under section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (36 CFR Parts 1193 and 1194). 3. Purpose The purpose of this procurement is to ensure that websites, applications, documents, forms, records and other E&IT for the International Trade Administration (ITA) are Section 508 compliant. 4.
