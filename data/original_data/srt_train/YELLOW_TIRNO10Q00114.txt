NOTE TO VENDORS:

   1) If you would like to receive more quotations from federal government agencies, you must be registered in the Central Contractor
      Registration (CCR) System.  Registration in CCR is required by all federal agencies in order to receive an award.  CCR allows the federal
      agency payment offices to disburse payments electronically directly to your banking account.  It also serves as the “official”
      socioeconomic status for your company in that information detailed in your CCR profile is ported into the Federal Procurement Data system
      for every award made to your company.  In addition, all small businesses (you must check the small business block under Business Type) in
      the CCR database, are automatically included in the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search database, which
      recently merged with CCR.  Please go to http://www.ccr.gov and click on Start New Registration.  Complete all of the required and optional
      information listed there.  Under Business Type, ensure you list all of the socioeconomic categories in which your company qualifies.  All
      federal government agencies and many prime contractors use the ProNet database to find sources.


   2) To receive electronic notification of upcoming procurement opportunities, you should be registered in Federal Business Opportunities
      (FedBizOpps).  Please go to http://www.fedbizopps.gov  and click on register.  You will then receive notification of any upcoming
      opportunities that are in your area of expertise.

        b. HUBZone Small Business Concern: A small business concern that appears on the List of Qualified HUBZone Small Business Concerns
