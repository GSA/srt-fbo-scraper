B. If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Battelle processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Battelle requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Battelle processes resume. C. Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award.

Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by Battelle except for evaluation purposes, shall-A. Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside Battelle and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed--in whole or in part--for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of--or in connection with--the submission of this data, Battelle shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit Battelle's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and B. Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. TREATMENT OF PROPOSAL DATA A. Although not specifically requested by the RFP, the proposal may include technical data and other data, including trade secrets and/or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, which the Offeror does not want, disclosed to the public or used by PNNL or the Government for any purpose other than proposal evaluation. To protect such data, the Offeror will specifically identify each page including each line or paragraph thereof containing the data to be protected and mark the cover sheet of the proposal with the following notice:

Page 4 of 8

NOTICE The data contained in pages _____ of this proposal have been submitted in confidence and contain trade secrets and/or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, and such data shall be used or disclosed only for evaluation purposes. PNNL and the Government shall have the right to use or disclose the data herein to the extent provided in the contract. This restriction does not limit PNNL's and the Government's right to use or disclose data obtained without restriction from any source, including the Offeror. Reference to this notice on the cover sheet should be placed on each page to which the notice applies. PNNL assumes no liability for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose such data for any purpose. B. Should a contract be awarded based on a proposal, it is policy, in consideration of the award, to obtain unlimited rights for the Government in technical data contained in the proposal unless the prospective contractor marks those portions of the technical information that he asserts as "proprietary data," or specifies those portions of such technical data that are not directly related to or will not be utilized in the work to be funded under this subcontract. "Proprietary data" are defined as technical data which embody trade secrets developed at private expense, such as design procedures or techniques, chemical composition of materials, or manufacturing methods, processes, or treatments, including minor modifications thereof, provided that such data: (1) are not generally known or available from other sources without obligation concerning their confidentiality; (2) have not been made available by the owner to others without obligation concerning their confidentiality; and (3) are not already available to the Government without obligation concerning their confidentiality. An Offeror who receives a contract award shall mark the data identified as proprietary by specifying the appropriate proposal page number to be inserted in the Rights to Proposal Data clause below. Subject to the concurrence of PNNL, information unrelated to the subject may be deleted from the proposal by the Offeror. The responsibility, however, of identifying technical data as proprietary or deleting it as unrelated rests with the Offeror. ANTI-KICKBACK PROCEDURES (CL 398 - JUL 1995) A. Definitions "Kickback," as used in this clause, means any money, fee, commission, credit, gift, gratuity, thing of value, or compensation of any kind which is provided, directly or indirectly, to Battelle, Battelle employees, subcontractor, or subcontractor employees for the purpose of improperly obtaining or rewarding favorable treatment in connection with a prime contractor in connection with a subcontract relating to a prime contract. "Person," as used in this clause, means a corporation, partnership, business association of any kind, trust, joint-stock company, or individual. "Prime contract," as used in this clause, means a contract or contractual action entered into by Battelle for the purpose of obtaining supplies, materials, equipment, or services of any kind. "Prime Contractor," as used in this clause, means a person who has entered into a prime contract with Battelle. "Prime Contractor employee," as used in this clause, means any officer, partner, employee, or agent of a prime Contractor. "Subcontract," as used in this clause, means a contract or contractual action entered into by Battelle or a subcontractor for the purpose of obtaining supplies, materials, equipment, or services of any kind under a prime contract. "Subcontractor," as used in this clause, (1) means any person, other than Battelle, who offers to furnish or furnishes any supplies, materials, equipment, or services of any kind under a prime contract or a subcontract entered into in connection with such prime contract, and (2) includes any person who offers to furnish or furnishes general supplies to Battelle or a higher tier subcontractor.

"Subcontractor employee," as used in this clause, means any officer, partner, employee, or agent of a subcontractor. B. The Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 (41 U.S.C. 51-58) (the Act), prohibits any person from 1. Providing or attempting to provide or offering to provide any kickback; 2. Soliciting, accepting, or attempting to accept any kickback; or 3.

The Contractor shall cooperate fully with any Federal agency investigating a possible violation described in paragraph B of this clause. 3. The Battelle Contracts Representative may (i) offset the amount of kickback against any monies owed by Battelle under the prime contract and/or (ii) direct that the prime Contractor withhold from sums owed a subcontractor under the prime contract, the amount of the kickback. The Battelle Contracts Representative may order that monies withheld under subdivision C.3.(ii) of this clause be paid over to DOE unless Battelle has already offset those monies under subdivision C.3.(i) of this clause. In either case, the Prime Contractor shall notify the Battelle Contracts Representative when the monies are withheld. 4. The Contractor agrees to incorporate the substance of this clause, including this subparagraph C.4, in all subcontracts under this contract which exceed $100,000.

BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (CL 606 - JAN 1986) The use of brand names in this Solicitation is intended to be descriptive and to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. If the offeror proposes to furnish an equal product, the brand name of such product shall be clearly identified in the offer. The determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of Battelle based on information furnished by the offeror. To ensure that sufficient information is available for evaluation, the offeror shall furnish as a part of its offer all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings, or other information) necessary for Battelle to 1) determine whether the product offered meets the essential characteristics of this Solicitation and 2) establish what Battelle would be binding itself to purchase. NOTE 1: Offers shall be considered as offering the brand name product referenced in this Solicitation unless offeror clearly indicates that it is offering an equal product. NOTE 2: If offeror proposes to modify a product to make it conform to the essential characteristics of this Solicitation it shall 1) include in its offer a clear description of such proposed modifications and 2) clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications. AUTHORIZED NEGOTIATORS If a negotiation meeting is held, the Offeror shall designate as its negotiator a person who is authorized to make legally binding commitments without further review or approval. If, for any reason, it is impractical for the Offeror to be represented at a negotiation meeting by other than a person fully authorized to act in its behalf, Battelle shall be notified sufficiently in advance to allow a decision to be made whether the negotiations should proceed as scheduled or be postponed. The Offeror's notice, if originally given orally, shall be confirmed in writing. CONTRACT AWARD a) Battelle may evaluate proposals received in response to this solicitation without discussion. Contract award, if any, will be made to the responsive, responsible offeror whose evaluated proposal will be most advantageous to Battelle, considering only price and any price-related factors specified elsewhere in the solicitation, or (b) Battelle may reject any or all proposals, and waive informalities or minor irregularities in proposals received, or (c) Battelle may accept any item or combination of items, unless doing so is precluded by a restrictive limitation in the solicitation or the proposal, or (d) Battelle may reject a proposal as non-responsive if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or sub-line items. A proposal is materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than prices for some items and prices which are significantly overstated in relation to prices for other items, and if there is a reasonable doubt that the proposal will result in the lowest overall price to Battelle even though it may be the low evaluated proposal, or if it is so unbalanced as to be tantamount to allowing an advance payment.

Customer Requirements A majority of our customers proof their documents using a local printer, most of which are manufactured by Hewlett Packard (HP). Once documents have been proofed and approved, they are then sent to the Duplicating Center for reproduction via the appropriate driver. These drivers must be accurate and well written so as not to change the layout of the document. An option to print via PCL or PS is required. Once sent to the Duplicating Center a document must be able to be proofed electronically by both the duplicating staff as well as the customer prior to final printing. Infrastructure Capabilities The system must be compatible with TCP/IP network and have the ability to receive documents from Windows, Macintosh, and Unix operating systems. It is required that the system have electronic job ticketing capabilities that supports standard and customizable job costing. It is required that the system have a standard API via which job ticketing/job cost information could be extracted and sent electronically to our internal accounting system for customer billing. All systems on the network must be able to receive the latest security updates to guard against vulnerabilities or they will not be allowed on the network.

G.

The Contractor's onsite ES&H activities will be subject to review by the Technical Administrator of this contract. Other representatives of Battelle may conduct periodic inspections of the Contractor's equipment, work and storage areas for compliance with the applicable ES&H requirements. The Battelle Contracts Representative will notify the Contractor by a written Notice of Non-compliance of any observed non-compliance with applicable ES&H requirements. The Contractor shall immediately take appropriate corrective action. The Contractor shall advise the Battelle Contracts Representative, in writing, within five (5) working days of the corrective action taken on any safety non-compliance noted on the written Notice of Non-compliance.

Such charges will be deducted from payments otherwise due the Contractor under this contract. The Contractor shall promptly evaluate and resolve any non-compliance with applicable ES&H requirements. If the Contractor fails to provide resolution or if, at any time, the Contractor's acts or failure to act causes substantial harm or an imminent danger to the environment, or health and safety of employees or the public, the Battelle Contracts Representative may issue an order stopping work in whole or in part and the Contractor shall be liable for the delay and any costs thereby incurred. Any stop-work order issued by Battelle under this clause (or issued by the Contractor to a subcontractor in accordance with this clause) shall be without prejudice to any other legal or contractual rights of Battelle. In the event that the Battelle Contracts Representative issues a stop-work order, an order authorizing the resumption of the work may be issued at the discretion of the Battelle Contracts Representative. The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time, or additional cost or fee, or damages by reason of, or in connection with, any work stoppage ordered in accordance with this clause.

specified under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of Part I of this provision, as appropriate, to verify submission of a completed Disclosure Statement. Caution: Offerors currently required to disclose because they were awarded a CAS-covered prime contract or subcontract of $50 million or more in the current cost accounting period may not claim this exemption (4). Further, the exemption applies only in connection with proposals submitted before expiration of the 90-day period following the cost accounting period in which the monetary exemption was exceeded. II. Cost Accounting Standards-Eligibility for Modified Contract Coverage If the offeror is eligible to use the modified provisions of 48 CFR 9903.201-2(b) and elects to do so, the offeror shall indicate by checking the box below. Checking the box below shall mean that the resultant contract is subject to the Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices clause in lieu of the Cost Accounting Standards clause.  The offeror hereby claims an exemption from the Cost Accounting Standards clause under the provisions of 48 CFR 9903.201-2(b) and certifies that the offeror is eligible for use of the Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices clause because during the cost accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this proposal was submitted, the offeror received less than $50 million in awards of CAS-covered prime contracts and subcontracts. The offeror further certifies that if such status changes before an award resulting from this proposal, the offeror will advise the Contracting Officer immediately.

Caution: An offeror may not claim the above eligibility for modified contract coverage if this proposal is expected to result in the award of a CAS-covered contract of $50 million or more or if, during its current cost accounting period, the offeror has been awarded a single CAS-covered prime contract or subcontract of $50 million or more. III. Additional Cost Accounting Standards Applicable to Existing Contracts The offeror shall indicate below whether award of the contemplated contract would, in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of the Cost Accounting Standards clause, require a change in established cost accounting practices affecting existing contracts and subcontracts.  Yes  No
