Total (Base + Option Periods I through IV) Note 1: For CLINS 0004 and 0005 (along with corresponding Option period CLINs), Offerors shall propose a unit price per user. This unit price shall be inserted into the Description section for that CLIN. The unit price per user proposed will be the Offeror's firm fixed price per user for the service required by the respective CLIN. For example, the number 500 provided above, for Base Year CLINS 0004 and 0005, are estimated Not to Exceed (NTE) quantities. As an illustration, to complete the preceding table (Schedule for CLINs 0004 and 0005), Offerors shall multiply their proposed unit price by 500 and insert the result into the unit price column for the respective CLIN. This is the unit price that will be used for evaluation. The Offeror shall insert the extended amount for 12 months in the Extended Amount column. This extended amount will also be evaluated. This extended amount will appear in a resultant contract. When Task Orders 3

RFQ# DOC52PAPT1200013 BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES are issued under this contract, CLINS 0004, and 0005 (and corresponding option CLINs) will be issued reflecting any quantity of users, but not exceeding the numbers identified below. For example, if a Task Order is issued ordering 12 months of CLIN 0004 Help Desk Support reflecting 200 users, and if the proposed per user price was $10.00 per user, the ordered CLIN would appear as follows:

CLIN 0004

Description Qty Help Desk Support 12 ($10 per user x NTE 200 users)

Unit Unit Price Month $2,000.00

Extended Amount NTE $24,000

If the Task Order is issued reflecting a NTE amount of 150 Users, the month unit price would be $1500. The Contractor shall invoice based upon the actual number of users, as long as the actual number does not exceed the NTE quantity for which the order was issued. Offerors must use the following NTE user numbers when determining the unit price to insert in the unit price column in the Schedule of Supplies Services and Prices. Base year CLINs: NTE User Number 0004 600 0005 600 Option 1 CLINs: NTE User Number 1004 600 1005 600 Option II CLINs: NTE User Number 2004 600 2005 600

Option III CLINs: NTE User Number 3004 600 3005 600 Option IV CLINs: NTE User Number 4004 600 4005 600 Further, with reference to CLINs 0004, 0005, and corresponding option year CLINs, Offerors are encouraged to propose step ladder quantity price discounts. For example, the Offeror may propose 4

RFQ# DOC52PAPT1200013 BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES one user per month price for orders reflecting 100 or less users, and a discounted price if the order is for > 100 users and <200, users or whatever step ladder quantities the offeror proposes. Note 2: For CLIN 0006, Broadband services, it is the government's intent that this unit price will be exactly the unit price actually charged by the Internet services (IS) provider without any burden (e.g., G&A, material handling fee) applied. Therefore, Offerors are not required to fill in proposed amounts for CLIN 0006. However, if any Offeror is proposing to apply a handling charge, the Offeror must make that clear in the Offer. Such proposed amount will be considered in the price evaluation. Note 3: Offerors are not prohibited from proposing a CLIN as Not Separately Priced (NSP).

2 Statement of Work

Managed Broadband Internet Services
2.1 Introduction and Overview This Statement of Work is for Managed Broadband Internet Services for the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The purpose of this contract is to provide commercial/business level Internet access for USPTO Teleworkers via cable modem or fiber optics and the ordering provisioning, installation, support, movement, disconnection of these lines, invoice consolidation and bill payment. 2.2 Background The USPTO Telework programs evolved from an initiative by former Vice President Al Gore, which established a policy where eligible employees of government agencies may participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance. The purpose of Section 359 of Public Law No. 106-346, October 23, 2000 is to enhance the quality of life of employees by reducing the time spent commuting to work. The program resulted in reduced road congestion, more time employees could spend with families, and reduced the need for USPTO office space. Over time, additional benefits were realized. Teleworkers continued to work through inclement weather that closed local offices. In 2010, Congress enacted the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010. Currently, USPTO is preparing its Telework Enhancement Act Pilot Program (TEAPP). The new program will potentially remove the geographic limitations of past telework programs resulting in a workforce more widely dispersed. With increased opportunities for telework, we anticipate increasing importance on stable and reliable internet access for USPTO telework employees. 2.3 Scope of Work The contractor shall provide management and support for teleworker's existing broadband lines and shall enter arrangements with third party carriers to order new installations of commercial/business grade cable modem or fiber optics from the homes of employees participating in the USPTO's various telework programs to the Internet. Information on the current users and internet service providers will be provided to the selected contractor upon contract award. Existing services support Teleworkers from three offices within the USPTO: Trademark, Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB), and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). The minimum acceptable bandwidth of broadband connections for new installations is: FiOS 15Mbps/5Mbps or more 6

RFQ# DOC52PAPT1200013 BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES Cable 12Mbps/2Mbps or more Existing connections may still include DSL 3Mbps/768Kbps or more (DSL is not acceptable for new installations). 2.4 Objectives The contractor shall achieve the following specific objectives:  The transfer of existing teleworker broadband lines to the contractor's management control and support. While the contractor will maintain and support these lines the accounts will remain in the name of the USPTO.  Provide for the ordering provisioning and installation of new broadband lines at the USPTO's request. USPTO may request availability of services for a new/proposed address before ordering.  Provide Help Desk support for USPTO's Teleworkers broadband lines  Provide invoice consolidation and bill payment services.  Provide live access to status information for orders, problem resolution, helpdesk tickets  Provide monthly reporting. 2.5 Requirements The contractor shall provide teleworkers with Internet access using cable modem or fiber optic at the identified locations. Where there is a choice of service at an address, the contractor will select fiber optics over cable modem. The contractor shall provide for the ordering, provisioning and installation of commercial grade/business class broadband Internet service in the teleworker's homes (through the contractor's arrangements with third party broadband carriers). In addition, the contractor will transfer existing USPTO teleworker accounts to the contractor's management control and be responsible for the performance and support of these lines. The contractor will provide Help Desk support as an adjunct to the USPTO Help Desk in troubleshooting connection issues and resolve problems with the broadband carrier. The USTPO will provide information regarding current broadband carriers upon contract award. 2.5.1 Provisioning Services The contractor will provide Provisioning Services under this contract that includes:  For the purpose of placing order calls (e.g., requests for new accounts, moves, etc.), it is desirable to have access via the contractor's web portal for placing requests. Similar access is desired for the purpose of tracking the status of all requests and activities such as status of new orders, installations, trouble tickets, resolution of issues, etc. Pre-qualification and ordering of new circuits with broadband carrier; verification of available services at a new address prior to ordering. Pricing of new circuits if a new carrier is introduced. Contacting USPTO teleworkers to schedule installations.

  

7

RFQ# DOC52PAPT1200013 BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES     Scheduling installations with broadband carriers and monitoring the status until completion. Resolution of any problems that occur during or resulting from the initial installation. Processing of moves ­ relocation of teleworkers to new residences and disconnection of broadband services. Proactive performance monitoring is desired. (i.e., identification of latency, packet loss, etc.).

2.5.2 Help Desk Support Services The contractor will provide Tier 2 Help Desk Support Service under this contract to support USPTO's teleworkers broadband Internet lines. The contractor will perform troubleshooting to resolve connection problems with user's broadband lines. The contractor will provide this support between the hours of 05:30 am and 10:00 pm Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Saturday to respond to calls from the USPTO Help Desk regarding performance issues with the broadband lines. If the contractor cannot resolve the problem, they will escalate it to the appropriate carrier. The following process will be followed for the resolution of connectivity issues:        The USPTO's Help Desk will contact the contractor's Help Desk and open a trouble ticket. The contractor's Help Desk will contract the end user at their home within 30 minutes of notification from the USPTO. The contractor will troubleshoot with the end user to isolate the problem. If the contractor cannot resolve the problem, they will immediately contact the appropriate carrier and open a trouble ticket. During the resolution process, the contractor will update the status of the ticket to keep USPTO apprised of the situation. If the contractor has provided a web portal for this Purpose, updates may be posted on the web portal. The contractor will continue to coordinate with the carrier until the problem is resolved. When the carrier advises the contractor that the problem is resolved, the contractor will contact the end user to confirm the status.

2.5.3 Invoice Consolidation and Bill Payment Services The contractor will notify the USPTO's broadband carriers that they are under contract with the USPTO to provide management services with regard to the USPTO's broadband lines and that the contractor is acting as the focal point for bill payment. The contractor will receive invoices from the carriers, audit them for accuracy, resolve billing discrepancies with the carriers, consolidate the invoices into one invoice in a format to be agreed upon by the contractor and USPTO, and then send the monthly-consolidated invoice to the USPTO for payment. The contractor will pay the invoices received from the carriers on behalf of the USPTO and insure that each carrier receives payment by the due date. Where USPTO has service/pricing agreements with IS providers, the amount invoiced shall be based on the current unit price negotiated between the provider and USPTO. In the event the contractor must enter into its own agreement with an IS provider (where no agreement already exists between the provider and USPTO, before entering into such 8

RFQ# DOC52PAPT1200013 BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES agreement, the contractor shall obtain written concurrence from the USPTO Contracting Officer on the unit prices that would be applicable.

(End of clause) 6.5 PTO-10 - Agency-Level Protest Procedures (DEC 1996) a. PURPOSE: To implement the requirements of Executive Order No. 12979 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR 33.103). On October 25, 1995, President Clinton signed Executive Order No. 12979, which directs heads of executive agencies to develop administrative procedures for resolving protests to awards of procurement contracts within their agencies at a level above the Contracting Officer. Authority to administer procurementrelated directives has been delegated within the Department of Commerce through the Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary for Administration to the Director for Acquisition Management (Procurement Executive). The Department's goal is to encourage protesters to resolve their protests at the agency level, help build confidence in the Government's acquisition system, and reduce protests to the General Accounting Office and other external fora. Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties shall use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party at the Contracting Officer level through open and frank discussions. If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency at a level above the Contracting Officer. b. DEFINITIONS: An agency protest is one that may be filed with either the contracting officer or the protest decision authority but not both. When a protester decides to file a protest at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the guidelines set forth in these established agency level protest procedures above the contracting officer apply. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 33.102. A day is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of the Department of Commerce are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Department is open. c. PROCEDURES:

19

RFQ# DOC52PAPT1200013 BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES i. Protesters using these procedures may protest to the protest decision authority who will make the final decision for the Department. Protests shall be addressed to: Chief Financial Officer U.S. Patent & Trademark Office P.O. Box 1450 Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency-level Protest". The protester shall also provide a copy of the protest within 1 day to the responsible contracting officer and a copy to the addressee indicated below: Office of the General Counsel General Law Office U.S. Patent & Trademark Office P.O. Box 1450 Alexandria, VA 22313-1450 (FAX Number 571-273-0099) ii. Election of forum: While a protest is pending at the agency level with the protest decision authority, the protester agrees not to protest to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or any other external forums. If the protester has already filed with the GAO or other external forums, the procedures described here may not be used. a. Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or time set for receipt of proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of proposals. If the contract has been awarded, protests must be filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after the date the protester was given the opportunity to be debriefed, whichever date is later. In cases other than those covered in the preceding two sentences, protests shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier. b. To be filed on a given day, protests must be received by 4:30 PM current local time. Amy protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day. Incomplete submissions will not be considered filed until all information is provided. c. To be complete, protests must contain the following information: 1. the protester's name, address, telephone number, and fax number 2. the solicitation or contract number, name of contracting office and the contracting officer 3. a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, and an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced 20

RFQ# DOC52PAPT1200013 BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES 4. 5. 6. 7. copies of relevant documents supporting protester's statement a request for ruling by the agency Statement as to form of relief requested all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purpose of filing a protest 8. all information establishing the timeliness of the protest 9. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. Within 14 days after the protest is filed, the Contracting Officer will prepare an administrative report that responds to the issues raised by the protester and addresses any other issues, which, even if not raised by the protester, have been identified by agency officials as being relevant to the fairness of the procurement process. For good cause shown, the protest decision authority may grant an extension of time for filing the administrative report and for issuing the written decision. When an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will notify the protester and all interested parties within I day of the decision to grant the extension. Unless an extension is granted, the protest decision authority will issue a decision within 35 days of the protest. The protest decision authority's final decision will be binding on the Department of Commerce and not subject to further appeals. The protest decision authority shall send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by certified mail, return receipt requested with information copies to the applicable contracting office and Office of Acquisition Management. iii. Effect of protest on award and performance: When a protest is filed prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) based on a written finding that: a. The supplies or services are urgently required, b. delivery or performance would be unduly delayed by failure to make the award promptly, or c. a prompt award will be in the best interest of the Government. When a protest is filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after a debriefing date was offered to the protester under a timely debriefing request in accordance with FAR 15.506, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer shall immediately suspend performance pending the resolution of the protest within the agency, including any review by an independent higher official, unless continued performance is justified. The HCA may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, based on a written finding that: d. contract performance would be in the best interest of the United States, or

21

RFQ# DOC52PAPT1200013 BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES e. urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision. d. REMEDIES: The protest decision authority may grant one or more of the following remedies: i. terminate the contract, ii. re -compete the requirement, iii. issue a new solicitation, iv. refrain from exercising options under the contract, v. award a contract consistent with statutes and regulations, vi. amend the solicitation provisions which gave rise to the protest and continue with the procurement, vii. such other remedies as the decision-maker may determine are necessary to correct a defect. (End of provision.) 6.6 PTO-17 CONTRACTOR FOIA REQUIREMENT Upon award of any contract resulting from this solicitation, the contractor shall be required to submit in electronic (.pdf or .tif) format, a copy of the contract with any proposed redactions it believes are necessary and required by law. If the contractor is proposing any redactions to the contract, the basis for the redactions shall be submitted in writing and must accompany the electronic copy of the contract.

7.5 Period of Acceptance Provision 7.5 supersedes any information on the cover page of this RFQ with respect to the time period the Offeror's offer will be valid for acceptance. Unless the Offeror explicitly states otherwise, its offer shall be valid for acceptance by the Government for 90 calendar days from the date the RFQ closes. 8 Evaluation 8.1 FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation ­ Commercial Items (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. Technical Approach (See Section 7.3 for description of items to be included in this section) 2. Experience/Past Performance 3. Price Factors 1 and 2 are of equal importance. Technical Approach and Experience/Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 8.2 Award Without Discussions The USPTO intends to award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussion. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best proposal. The USPTO reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Should the Contracting Officer determine it necessary to conduct discussions, such discussions may be conducted as described in either the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). If discussions are conducted in accordance with the FAR, the Contracting Officer may determine the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range 28

RFQ# DOC52PAPT1200013 BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICES exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted. In such circumstances, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated offerors. 8.3 Best Value Determination The USPTO will make an award resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer will be most advantageous and represent the best value to the USPTO, price and other factors considered. In making the best value determination, the USPTO will evaluate technical approach, experience/past performance, and price. The USPTO shall determine what tradeoff among these factors provides the greatest value to the USPTO. Evaluation Factors are listed in descending order of importance: Factor 1 Technical Approach ­ The USPTO will evaluate the quality, completeness, responsiveness, relevance, and credibility of the offeror's overall proposed technical approach pertaining to meeting all of the requirements of the USPTO as described in Section 2 of the RFQ; (2) Offeror's proposed additional measures and standards (if any) explaining how they will benefit the USPTO. Factor 2 Past Performance and Experience ­ The USPTO will evaluate the Offeror's experience and past performance based on its demonstrated ability to perform the activities specified in Section 2 of this solicitation by comparing the type, size, scope and complexity of the Offeror's previous prime or subcontract experience with the type, size, scope and complexity of the requirements specified in Section 2 of this RFQ. The USPTO will evaluate the quality of the Offeror's past and present performance in similar services in programs of similar size, scope, and complexity. The USPTO will also assess the relevance of the Offeror's submitted Past Performance Questionnaires. Factor 3 Price ­ For CLINs 0001, 0002, 0003 and corresponding outyear CLINs the evaluated price will be the extended price based upon maximum quantities for the base and 4 option years; for CLINs 0004 and 0005 and corresponding out-year CLINs, the per user per month price proposed will be evaluated as well as the extended amounts. CLIN 0006 is expected to be an actual cost pass-through, and as such would not be evaluated, however, if an offeror proposes a handling fee, such fee will be included in the price evaluation. Factors 1 and 2 are of equal importance. Technical Approach and Experience/Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. 29

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
