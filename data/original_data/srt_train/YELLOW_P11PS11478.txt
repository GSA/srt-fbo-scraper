SYSTEM DESCRIPTION OVERVIEW
A.

The Bryce Canyon Lodge Auditorium is a multipurpose space that is used primarily for presentations and educational sessions provided by the Bryce Canyon National Park Rangers to visitors. The room has a capacity of approximately 150 attendees seated on portable chairs arranged at the audience area. There is a stage located at the front of the auditorium from which the presenter provides the presentation. Presentation Needs: Most events at the auditorium involve the presentation of computer video (PowerPoint or similar) using an OFE laptop. The current system provides input connections at the rack closet only and therefore requires long extension chords, video and audio cables to be run between the closet and the presenter's position. A new system shall provide connection points at or near the stage where convenient for connection of sources at a podium or portable table. A permanently installed video projector will be provided for use with the ceiling mounted projection screen (OFE). The video projector will be permanently wired to the video switching system. Aside from computer video from laptops, the system will also provide inputs for a rack mounted Bluray player (capable of playing Bluray discs, DVDs and/or CDs) and a future provided cable TV feed. Both digital (HDMI) and analog (VGA) inputs will be provided at 2 separate connection plates at the sides of the stage for connection to the video system. Audio System: The audio system shall provide stereo and limited surround sound reinforcement for speech and music reinforcement. Given that the primary objective of the audio system is to provide clear and intelligible speech reinforcement during presentations, the system will be optimized for this purpose. Two highly directional column-style loudspeaker arrays will be provided and installed at the sides of the stage. Additional "surround" loudspeakers will be provided and installed on the side and rear walls to provide surround sound coverage for special effects during presentations and shows. A subwoofer will also be provided and placed on the stage-floor to one side of the stage. The surround system will be limited to a 6.1 arrangement (Front Left and Right, Surround Left and Right, Rear Left and Right, Subwoofer). Presenter's Lectern: The new AV system shall include a movable lecter for use on the stage during presentations. The lectern shall provide a surface for a laptop and all necessary connectivity for use during a presentation (digital and analog video, AV audio inputs and control system connectivity). A permanent microphone shall be 10/19/2010 SECTION 11970 - 8

included with the lectern. The lectern shall connect to the AV connection plate on the wall using a bundled snake with sufficient length to located the lectern at the desired location while minimizing any tripping hazard due to the cables laying on the stage floor.
E.

Control System: An integrated control system shall be provided to allow a single/common user interface to be used for control of all AV systems and subsystems including: 1. Audio system basic functions: level, mutes, modes of operation, presets, etc. 2. Surround system control for changing presets 3. Video projection system: projector and screen control. 4. Lighting system presets for both stage and architectural lighting 5. Video presentation switcher for selection of desired video source to projector 6. Bluray player and capability to control future-provided CATV tuner The system shall include two separate user control panels. The primary control panel will be provided and integrated at the lectern for use by the presenter. An additional panel will be provided wall-mounted inside the rack room for backup purposes and/or for use when the lectern is not connected. The wall-mounted touchpanel will be detachable for wireless use throughout the auditorium. The labeling on the control panel icons and buttons shall be intuitive and self-explanatory to a nontechnical user.

F.

Wired Microphones: A total of 4 microphone inputs will be provided to the system. Connections will be provided at the wall mounted plates at the side of the stage for use with the lectern or for direct connection of a microphone using an XLR cable. Microphone inputs will be optimized for gooseneck microphones provided and should not be used with other microphones unless adjusted appropriately. Line Inputs: The microphone inputs shall double as line inputs if so desired (for example, for connecting an external sound mixing board for use with the PA system). The control system shall provide a control to switch the inputs to this mode while maintaining adequate sound levels. Wireless Microphone System: A two channel wireless microphone system shall be provided for hands-free use of the system by the presenter. For each wireless microphone channel, two microphone types will be provided: 1. A handheld microphone 2. A headset style microphone for use with a beltpack transmitter Auxiliary Inputs: Additional audio inputs to the system shall include audio inputs from the AV system (for audio from computers and Bluray player), as well as a combination CD/digital-audio player (with an IPOD-style doc king station plus an 1/8" jack for line level audio). AV Equipment Location: Most equipment will be installed in the AV equipment rack located inside the service closet adjacent to the stage. The equipment rack shall be 10/19/2010 SECTION 11970 - 9

Execute wiring in strict adherence to A Clean Audio Installation Guide, Allen H Burdick, Benchmark Media Systems, Inc., (800) 262-4675, (available on the World Wide Web at http://www.benchmarkmedia.com/); Audio System Design and Installation, Phillip Giddings, Sams, 1990, ISBN 0-672-22672-3; "Recommended Wiring Practices", Sound System Engineering (2nd Edition), Davis and Davis, Sams, 1987, ISBN 0-672-21857-7; "Cabling", Sound Reinforcement Handbook (2nd Edition), Gary Davis & Ralph Jones, Hal Leonard, 1989, ISBN 0-88188-900-8; and performed to the highest standards of acknowledged industry and professional practice. Take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent and guard against electromagnetic and electrostatic hum. For permanently installed line level audio circuits, ground cable shields at the output of the source device and float at the input of the destination device. If RF interference is encountered, place an RC network between the floated shield and the input ground. All wire, after being cut and stripped, shall have the wire strands twisted back to their original lay and terminated by approved soldered or mechanical means. No bare wire ends are acceptable. Cables terminated in pluggable terminal strips or other connectors which could accept bare wire ends shall have the wire ends first terminated in properly crimped insulated wire ferrules. Cables with wire shields, braid or wound, must use all the wire conductors for shield termination, and not just a drain wire or some of the shield strands. Connections not following this requirement will be rejected. Foil shielded cables only provided with a drain wire must use the drain wire for shield termination. Fold shields or drain wires not connected back over the cable jacket and cover with heat shrinkable tubing; do not cut off unused shields or drain wires. Dress the shield or drain wires with Teflon tubing, and install heat shrinkable tubing over the junction of the fanout and outer jacket. Exercise care in wiring; damage to cables or equipment will not be accepted. Isolate cables of different signal types or levels, and separate, organize, and route cabling to prevent crosstalk or feedback oscillation in any amplifier section. In all cases, separate wiring for microphone signals, audio line level signals, loudspeakers, video, control, RF, and power into groups. Rack Wiring. Looking at the rack from the rear, locate AC power, digital and DC control, and loudspeaker wiring on the left; microphone, line level Audio, IF, RF, and other wiring on the right. Run wiring vertically in adequately sized plastic raceways, or employ an equivalent bundling and support system, to maintain a clear and organized appearance. Neatly tie horizontally routed wiring to equipment in manageable bundles, with cable lengths cut to minimize excess but sufficient to allow ready service, testing, or replacement of connectors. Provide a horizontal support bar system for large bundles. Route AC cords directly to the side of the rack, under or over the equipment chassis, and then back to the power outlets, tying the 10/19/2010 SECTION 11970 - 34

excess cord only at the side of the rack. Organize cabling so that signal and AC cords are in the least possible proximity.
G.

All wiring and connections shall be completely visible and labeled in the rack. Resistors employed in the system external to equipment shall be metal film 1% tolerance, wattage as required for the application (but in no case less than 1/4 watt), and fully visible and not concealed within equipment or connectors (other than RC networks for RF rejection). No splices shall exist in any length of cable run, unless specifically shown on the contract drawings at a designated junction enclosure. All cables shall originate and terminate at active or passive devices. Where several devices are in close proximity, utilize approved housing-to-housing connectors and adapters; all such adapters shall be rotational. Do not wire any cables with a polarity reversal between connectors, end for end, unless required by the manufacturer for operation. Connect all loudspeakers electrically in phase and of consistent polarity, using the same wire color code for loudspeaker wiring throughout the project. Note that different manufacturers employ differing color coding conventions for driver terminals. Wire all drivers cone, compression, ribbon, or any other type - so that a positive voltage at the power amplifier "+" terminal causes a positive acoustic pressure out of the driver/enclosure system. For cables terminating at an interface or connection plate mounted on or in an enclosure, dress cables so as to allow removal of the plate from the enclosure and sufficient cable length for service or re-termination. In these circumstances, the plate shall set on the floor or freely swing clear. Install cables without sharp bends or distortion. Where limited clearance prevents the manufacturer's recommended minimum bend radius from being observed, such as in junction boxes, provide a right angle or similar connector. All expansion loops must be neat, and roughly the same size to provide for ease of servicing in the future. In pulling cable, do not bend to less than the manufacturer's recommended radius. Employ temporary guides, sheaves, rollers, or other tools to prevent excessive tension or abrasion to the cable(s). Pull cable with tensions, tools, and lubricants recommended by the manufacturer. Prepare television system semi-rigid cable in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations, with approved coring, cleaning, preparation and assembly tools. Do not score center conductor; utilize tubing cutters to trim the outer conductor. Completely de-burr all conductors. Utilize approved center conductor cleaning tool; degrease the connector and cable prior to termination. Torque connectors to the manufacturer's recommended values. 10/19/2010 SECTION 11970 - 35

Ordinary plastic cable ties must never be used on UTP cabling. Plastic cable ties or anything else that can pinch the jacket of the UTP must be avoided. Use Velcro strap type ties as required but preferably not more often than once every 10 feet. UTP cables must never be combed out neatly so that they run parallel to each other. Such a practice can cause Alien Crosstalk between the cables that run next to each other. Instead let the UTP cables run with a loose and random lay. UTP cables must never be bundled snugly together. UTP cables installed in Conduit or other wire ways must never exceed 40% fill. UTP cables must never have more than 25 lbs. (or the manufacturer's maximum recommended pull force if lower) of force applied while pulling into conduit or at any other time during installation. UTP cables must never be bent sharper than a 1" radius (2" diameter) bend even if straightened out afterwards. The only exception to this is the Belden MediaTwist patch cord at the Desk Unit that is designed to allow a sharper bend.

CONNECTIONS
A.

Make all joints and connections with rosin core solder or with mechanical connectors approved by the Consultant. Where spade lugs are used, crimp properly with ratchet type tool. Spade lugs shall be gold or nickel plated to match the receiving binding post or terminal. DC, control, and loudspeaker wiring shall connect via terminal blocks (Phoenix Contact MBK 2.5/E or MBK 5/E mounted on NS 35/7.5 DIN mounting rails, or approved equal); all terminal blocks shall be fully exposed, labeled, and mounted on 1/2" birch veneer plywood board primed and painted two coats latex enamel. Microphone, Audio line, video, time code, MIDI, RF, and digital signal or control wiring shall be continuous and unbroken from connector plate/chassis to chassis/patch panel, unless a terminal, connector, or other splice is explicitly shown on the contract drawings. Make all solder connections with rosin core solder; employ temperature controlled soldering irons of wattage appropriate to the specific work involved. Soldering guns or unregulated irons are unacceptable. Pluggable terminal strips or other connectors which could accept bare wire ends must have the wires terminated first using properly crimped insulated wire ferrules. Bare wire ends directly into a connector that does not use solder or crimp connections are not acceptable. Install ferrules with manufacturer approved crimp tool. Conventional non-ratcheting crimping tools are not acceptable. Make all connections with connectors specified herein. Employ XLR and BNC connectors wherever possible in preference to screw terminals, terminal strips, or phono connectors. All connectors employed shall be designed specifically for the cable in use. 10/19/2010 SECTION 11970 - 39

Make connections to loudspeaker transformers with properly sized closed end connectors crimped with factory approved ratchet type tools, or terminal blocks. All coaxial connectors shall be crimped with the appropriate hexagonal die crimp tool correct for the combination of cable and connector. Non-ratcheting type crimping tools are not acceptable; the presence of such tools on the job site shall be interpreted as evidence of mechanical connections incorrectly made, and provide sufficient grounds for rejection of all mechanical connections in the system. "Electrical" adhesive backed tape is not acceptable for any purpose whatsoever. Adhesive cable tie anchors are only acceptable when employed for routing, not support; in any case do not fasten anchors to any equipment chassis. Do not employ connector adapters. Wire nut or "Scotchlock" connectors are not acceptable for any purpose.

LABELING
A.

Provide engraved plastic Lamicoid (or similar) identification labels at the front and rear of all equipment mounted in racks. Install labels in a neat, plumb, square, and permanent manner. Mount labels on the equipment rack, not on the equipment, or on blank rack panels if so directed. Where the rack vertical frame has a slightly recessed mid section, match label width to the recessed section width. Similarly, provide engraved labels at the rear only of equipment mounted in furniture consoles or frames. Equipment labels should have two items of information; the first identifying the equipment type, i.e., "POWER AMPLIFIER"; and the second showing the wiring diagram code, i.e., "AMP-01". Unless otherwise noted, engraving on plates, panels, and labels shall be 1/8" high, and the typeface, sans serif. Use white letter fill on dark panels or push-buttons, and black fill on stainless steel or brushed natural aluminum plates or light-colored pushbuttons. Fill safety or operational warning labels orange. Embossed labels are not acceptable for any purpose. Label all cables except patch cords at both ends with self-laminating labels. Handwritten labels are not acceptable. Include sample of proposed label system with submittals. Employ an alphanumeric cable code identifying the signal type by letter: microphone = M; data = D; line level analog Audio = A; loudspeaker level = S; video = V; RGBHV = R; RF = F; control = C; intercom = IC; Audio network = N; etc., with a unique identifier for each cable. Locate labels within 2" of the connectors, consistent with regard to orientation, dress, and distance from the connector. For connections to in-room panels or floorboxes, label on cable should match panel engraving. For connections to portable equipment, label on cable should match device engraving. Label each terminal strip with a unique identification code in addition to the 10/19/2010 SECTION 11970 - 40

SYSTEM STARTUP
A.

Preliminary. Verify the following before beginning actual tests and adjustments on the system: 1. All electronic devices are properly grounded. 2. All powered devices have AC power from the proper circuit. All dedicated AC power circuits are properly wired, phased, and grounded. 3. Insulation and shrink tubing are present where required. 4. Dust, debris, solder splatter, etc. is removed. 5. All cable is dressed, routed, and labeled; all connections are properly made and consistent with regard to polarity. Grounding System Tests. 1. Measure the DC resistance between the technical ground in any equipment rack or console and the main building ground. Resistance should be 0.15 ohms or less. 2. Verify that the Bryce Canyon Lodge where applicable has connected the technical ground to building ground at only one location with 4 AWG or larger wire. 3. Measure the DC resistance between the signal ground at any connector plate and the conduit system. 4. Identify and correct any problems if within the A/V System scope of work; notify the Owner if a problem is in a related area of work. System shall be completely free of hum, parasitic oscillation, ground loops, RF interference, and any audible noise and distortion problems. Video Timing and Phasing shall be achieved using the fewest delay lines, delay distribution amplifiers and other delay devices possible. At all times, match cable lengths between like paths to minimize timing errors. To the maximum extent possible, utilize precisely cut cables to achieve correct timing and phasing. Although some delay units (active or passive) may be shown on the drawings to achieve the required video timing, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing all such units that may be required to meet these performance specifications. In all cases, minimize the number of delay lines. Keep cable lengths equal to achieve timing. Cable and Fiber. Test all cables as installed for shorts between conductors or to building ground and opens. Certify all data cables to Category 6 (Draft 9a) or better using a tester capable of 350 MHz measurements such as Fluke DSP-4300, Agilent WireScope 350 or equivalent. Certify all optical fiber for TIA 568A and ISO 11801 compliance. Measure the loop resistance of all loudspeaker cables. Document all tests and complete measurement results including wire number, date, test 10/19/2010 SECTION 11970 - 41

G.

Audio System Tests. Perform the following tests and adjustments, supplying all test equipment required. Set for slow meter damping and A or Linear weighting as required. Make corrections necessary to bring the system(s) into compliance with the specifications. 1. Measure and record the impedance of each loudspeaker line circuit terminating at the equipment rack, with loudspeakers connected, over the entire frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. 2. Adjust the gain of each active device to provide optimum signal-to-noise ratio and 18 to 20 dB headroom. Record input and output levels at each step in the signal chain. 3. Measure and record overall system hum and noise level of each mic or line amplifier with controls set so that -50 dBu microphone input or +4 dBu line level input would drive the system to full amplifier output. Terminate inputs with appropriately sized shielded resistors (150 ohms typical) for this test. 4. Measure and record system electrical frequency response for each input channel through power amplifier output with all filters and equalization bypassed in the DSP. Deviation shall not exceed ą .75dB within the range 20 Hz to 20 kHz. 5. Check system to assure freedom from oscillation or stray RF pickup. Check all inputs without signal and with 500 Hz sine wave driving system to full average output. Detect unwanted signals on oscilloscope at rack termination and over single loudspeakers connected at the farthest distance from the rack for each loudspeaker line. 6. Apply a sinusoidal sweep signal to each loudspeaker system, sweeping from 50 to 5000 Hz at a level 10 dB below full amplifier output, and listen for rattles or objectionable noise. Correct any rattles or noise that is discovered. 7. Check the polarity of all loudspeakers with an electronic polarity checker, and by applying music program or pink noise signal to the system while walking through the transition areas of coverage from one loudspeaker to the next. Transition should be smooth with no apparent shift in source from one loudspeaker to the next.

Presentation Needs: 
Most events at the auditorium involve the presentation of computer video (PowerPoint or similar) using  an OFE laptop. The current system provides input connections at the rack closet only and therefore  requires long extension cords, video and audio cables to be run between the closet and the presenter's  position. A new system shall provide connection points at or near the stage where convenient for  connection of sources at a podium or portable table. A permanently installed video projector will be  provided for use with the ceiling mounted projection screen (OFE). The video projector will be  permanently wired to the video switching system. Aside from computer video from laptops, the system  will also provide inputs for a rack mounted Bluray player (capable of playing Bluray discs, DVDs, CDs  and/or iPODs) and a future provided cable TV feed. Both digital (HDMI) and analog (VGA) inputs will be  provided at 2 separate connection plates at the sides of the stage for connection to the video system. 

Stage Connectivity: 
On both the stage right and stage left wall, there will be identical wall plates with connectivity to the AV  system.  Having connectivity on both sides of the stage will allow for convenient connectivity in a variety  of presentation arrangements with the lectern and or microphones on either side of the stage.  Along with the aforementioned digital (HDMI) and analog (VGA) video inputs, each of the stage AV  connection wall plates will have 2 auxiliary microphone inputs, a 1/8" stereo computer audio input, and  control system connectivity for the touchscreen mounted in the lectern.  The control screen will allow  the presenter at the podium to very easily control room lighting, audio volume, video source (computer  screen, DVD, BluRay), etc...  Control system functionality is discussed in greater detail later in this  document.

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder

and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance: The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4). 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

Part 1: Past Performance Rating Criteria: CODE DESCRIPTION E Exceptional / High Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the successful offeror will successfully perform the required effort. V Very Good / Significant Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. S Satisfactory / Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. N Neutral / Unknown Confidence No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) and (iv)). M Marginal / Little Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Changes to the offeror's existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements. U Unsatisfactory / No Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

Part II - Technical CODE DESCRIPTION E Exceptional / High Confidence Based on the offeror's technical proposal, essentially no doubt exists that the successful offeror will successfully perform the required effort. V Very Good / Significant Confidence Based on the offeror's technical proposal, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. S Satisfactory / Confidence Based on the offeror's technical proposal, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. N Neutral / Unknown Confidence No technical proposal identifiable. M Marginal / Little Confidence Based on the offeror's technical proposal, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Changes to the offeror's existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements. U Unsatisfactory / No Confidence Based on the offeror's technical proposal, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Part III - Cost / Price Proposal Part III shall be in accordance with the solicitation requirements. The Government reserves the right to obtain additional information concerning the price/cost as necessary to obtain a better understanding of the price proposed. No proposal revisions will be allowed under these conditions. Request for such information is for clarification purposes only. This does not constitute and shall not be construed as discussions. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion. In accordance with FAR 15.304, past performance and the technical proposal (combined) are significantly more important than price. The purpose of the price/cost evaluation is to determine whether an offeror's proposed prices/costs for the project are reasonable and realistic in relation to the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an offeror's understanding of the proposal requirements. Any inconsistencies, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly justified. For example, if unique and innovative approaches are the basis for an abnormally low proposed price, the nature of these approaches and their impact to the proposed price must be completely documented. The burden of proof of cost credibility rests solely with the offeror. The evaluation team will evaluate each offeror's price proposal based on the total price and on the basis of the following factors of equal importance: Cost Realism: Proposed costs will be evaluated to determine if any costs are unrealistically high or low in relation to the Government's Independent Cost Estimate and the Offeror's technical/management approach. Cost risks will be identified as to the degree of realism in the proposal. Reasonableness: The offeror's proposal will be reviewed to determine if the proposed costs are reasonable. Completeness: Price proposals will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror provided sufficient data as required by the solicitation and schedule B.

Those proposals evaluated as not satisfying all of the price/cost factors may be eliminated from further consideration unless the Contracting Officer determines: a) A minor clerical error has occurred, then the offeror may be given an opportunity to correct the minor error within the constraints of the "clarifications" process or b) The Contracting Officer determines discussions are required.

N/A (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (d) The following offeror-provided information as described in section L shall be used to evaluate offers: Part I - Past Performance Part II - Technical Proposal Part III - Price Proposal (e) To arrive at a best value/ most advantagous to the Government decision, the Source Selection Official (SSO) will integrate the evaluation of past performance, technical capabilities, and price. While the Government and the SSO will strive for maximum objectivity, the evaluation process, by its nature, is subjective and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire evaluation process. A proposal receiving an unsatisfactory/no confidence rating may be removed from further consideration for award. (f) The source selection process will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15.3, Source Selection procedures. Offers will be evaluated using the criteria described herein. Noncompliance with the RFP requirements may be grounds to eliminate a proposal from consideration for contract award. Failure to include all information requested may adversely affect the evaluation. A proposal that merely reiterates or promises to accomplish the requirements of the RFP will be considered unsatisfactory. A proposal that is orderly and sufficiently documented will enable the Government to perform a thorough and fair evaluation. (g) Offerors must ensure that no pricing information is displayed in Part I - Past Performance or Part II - Technical Proposal. (h) The Government may evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals (as described in FAR 15.306(c)). (i) The Government reserves the right to reject any or all offers if such action is in the Government's best interest.

(j) Part 1: Past Performance Rating Criteria: CODE DESCRIPTION E Exceptional / High Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the successful offeror will successfully perform the required effort. V Very Good / Significant Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. S Satisfactory / Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. N Neutral / Unknown Confidence No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) and (iv)). M Marginal / Little Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Changes to the offeror's existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements. U Unsatisfactory / No Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. (k) Part II - Technical CODE DESCRIPTION E Exceptional / High Confidence Based on the offeror's technical proposal, essentially no doubt exists that the successful offeror will successfully perform the required effort. V Very Good / Significant Confidence Based on the offeror's technical proposal, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. S Satisfactory / Confidence Based on the offeror's technical proposal, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. N Neutral / Unknown Confidence No technical proposal identifiable. M Marginal / Little Confidence Based on the offeror's technical proposal, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Changes to the offeror's existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements. U Unsatisfactory / No Confidence Based on the offeror's technical proposal, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. (l) Part III - Cost / Price Proposal Part III shall be in accordance with the solicitation requirements. The Government reserves the right to obtain additional information concerning the price/cost as necessary to obtain a better understanding of the price proposed. No proposal revisions will be allowed under these conditions. Request for such information is for clarification purposes only. This does not constitute and shall not be construed as discussions. Proposals unrealistically high or low in price, when compared to the Government estimate, and market conditions evidenced by other competitive proposals received, may be indicative of an inherent lack of understanding of the solicitation requirements and may result in proposal rejection without discussion.

In accordance with FAR 15.304, past performance and the technical proposal (combined) are significantly more important than price. The purpose of the price/cost evaluation is to determine whether an offeror's proposed prices/costs for the project are reasonable and realistic in relation to the solicitation requirements and demonstrates an offeror's understanding of the proposal requirements. Any inconsistencies, whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly justified. For example, if unique and innovative approaches are the basis for an abnormally low proposed price, the nature of these approaches and their impact to the proposed price must be completely documented. The burden of proof of cost credibility rests solely with the offeror. The evaluation team will evaluate each offeror's price proposal based on the total price and on the basis of the following factors of equal importance: Cost Realism: Proposed costs will be evaluated to determine if any costs are unrealistically high or low in relation to the Government's Independent Cost Estimate and the Offeror's technical/management approach. Cost risks will be identified as to the degree of realism in the proposal. Reasonableness: The offeror's proposal will be reviewed to determine if the proposed costs are reasonable. Completeness: Price proposals will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror provided sufficient data as required by the solicitation and schedule B. Those proposals evaluated as not satisfying all of the price/cost factors may be eliminated from further consideration unless the Contracting Officer determines: a) A minor clerical error has occurred, then the offeror may be given an opportunity to correct the minor error within the constraints of the "clarifications" process or b) The Contracting Officer determines discussions are required. (m) Contract Award A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. The Government contemplates award of a Firm Fixed contract resulting from this solicitation.
