The NextGen.gov sitemap was informed by DOL/ETA (workforce3one) content audit/analysis, NextGen.gov target audience analysis, goals for the NextGen site, taxonomy workshops and usability testing. The final sitemap went through multiple rounds of updates where analysis and workshop results were synthesized and reconciled to refine and create the final NextGen.gov sitemap. In essence the sitemap defines navigational paths and allows site users to have a highlevel and holistic overview the site and its content. During the usability testing that was conducted, users responded positively to the sitemap. The sitemap also helped shape and prioritize other elements on the site to ensure that the site including content, layout user experience is cohesive. For example, consider the filter used across the site; the facets in the filters are ordered in a way that follows directly from the sitemap. On the Resource Library & Site Search Results page, the facets are ordered first by topic, followed by programs, target population, methodology etc. Hence, changing the sitemap after this point  especially the primary navigation would require assessing the impact on the site as a whole where necessary, as well as validate the changes through doing a usability test.

Innovations in Action

Note: The highlighted page will use the Home wireframe.

Overview
ˇ The homepage provides an overview of what Workconnects is (meeting the needs of new users) as well as content that is updated on a regular basis (meeting the needs of return users who want to know what is new). It also includes calls to action that summarize the main things users can do and (hopefully) encourages them to participate in the community.

Notes
ˇ Rotating Banner: It will be static if there is only one announcement and will rotate if there are more. There is a minimum requirement of 1 slide, but no maximum requirement. ˇ Homepage Deign ­ `Find Resources' and `Around Communities of Practice' will be above the fold; visible on the homepage without scrolling. ˇ Rotator (Newsletter): Will continually contain a slide that links to the newest newsletter. Need a standard graphic for newsletter. ˇ Rotator (General): DOL does not have the ability to create graphics. Need a standard graphical element for each primary navigation category. Will be used when linking to a page in the selected category. ˇ My Workconnects Component: My Workconnects component is customizable. Users can choose what tabs are displayed in widget. One of the tabs that users can add is My Communities. ˇ Top Five Resources: top five resources ­ excluding SGA Resources ­ that are most frequently downloaded will be automatically displayed. DOL wants ability to override. ˇ Design Flexibility: There is concern that the homepage includes too much content, making it look cluttered. The `Resource Spotlight/ Top Five Resources' and `Webinar Spotlights' are not required components. DOL and the Design Team may decide to remove these elements during the Design Phase. ˇ General Note: The industry standard is always changing based on what browsers users are using. The designers will look at browser display statistics to select the appropriate resolution: http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp

Innovations in Action

Note: The highlighted pages will use the Resource Listing wireframe.

Overview
ˇ The Resource Listing page provides users with a list of resources and filters. The filters are useful since they enable users to intuitively narrow results to find what they want.

Notes
ˇ If the resource from the CoP is posted without an author or by admin, don't show name of author, only show CoP. This is necessary because some CoP admin post a lot of content. Principle applies to entire site. ˇ Sort by Date, Views, Thumbs Up, Alphabetical ˇ Top Providers Component: System must accommodate this functionality, but site won't include it at launch. ˇ Taxonomy ­ need to actively inform a fluid taxonomy at the topic level, plus autotagging software that helps us go back and retag things based on changing taxonomy. ˇ Need to specify a character limit for each resource's teaser text. ˇ To meet 508 requirements, the page will refresh each time a filter is clicked. The corresponding results will be displayed. ˇ Three terms will be displayed for each facet, except for the facet that contains the children of the taxonomy term that is the page title. Up to 10 children will be displayed. To see the remaining terms, the user can click the "More" link. ˇ Terms in each facet will be listed alphabetically (not by the number of items associated with it).

Workforce Practice Profile Detail

Note: The highlighted pages will use the Resource Detail wireframe.

Overview
ˇ In addition to intuitively providing access to resources, the Resource Detail page provides an overview of a resource so the user can evaluate whether s/he is interested. Users can further evaluate a resource by reviewing the ratings, views and comments. The rating and commenting functionality enable users to participate in the workforce system community.

Notes
ˇ If the resource from the CoP is posted without an author or by admin, don't show name of author, only show CoP. This is necessary because some CoP admin post a lot of content. Principle applies to entire site. ˇ Top Providers Component: System must accommodate this functionality, but site won't include it at launch. ˇ Taxonomy ­ need to actively inform a fluid taxonomy at the topic level, plus autotagging software that helps us go back and retag things based on changing taxonomy. ˇ Need to specify a character limited for each resource's teaser text. ˇ To meet 508 requirements, the page will refresh each time a filter is clicked. The corresponding results will be displayed. ˇ User must be logged in to rate content. If a user who is not logged in clicks on the thumbs up/thumbs down, the Login/Register page should be displayed. ˇ The document preview will open in a new window/tab. ˇ The Related Resources component will be automatically populated with three resources. We need to define how it will be populated. However, DOL will have ability override the automatic population. ˇ There are four authorship fields: Resource Authors, Resource Organizational Authors, Posted By, Posted In. Some resources will have values for all fields while others will not. When there is no value, the field will be hidden. ˇ We said users can share the resource via Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter. DOL requires the ability to manage this list. ˇ Comments: By default, comments will be sorted by Recent First. Users will have the option to sort by Oldest First. ˇ Comments: By default, three comments will be displayed. Users can click "Read More Comments" to see all comments ­ the length of the page will grow to display all comments.

To be effective guides, coaches, and mentors, case managers must employ a wide range of skills and tools, all of which must be supported by administrative practices and policies.

Workforce Innovation Forum
In an increasingly competitive world economy, America's economic strength depends on the education and skills of its workers. The Federal government currently invests over $9 billion annually in employment and training programs designed to support an efficiently functioning labor market and economy. That system is continuously called upon to do more with less -- to meet the needs of a dynamic and vastlychanged national labor market and address a looming skills gap in a rapidly shifting economy with diminishing resources. To succeed in this context, the system needs to deliver services that are costeffective, demanddriven, and high impact -- and clearly demonstrate how it does so.

My My Workconnects Views: There are two views of My Workconnects:
My Workconnects is displayed within the main site's global elements. When users access My Workconnects from the main site, it is displayed within the main site since the main site provides a global perspective on what is happening in all NextGen.gov sites. My Workconnects is dispayed within the CoP wrapper (not the specific CoP). When users access My Workconnects from a CoP, it is displayed with the CoP wrapper since My Workconnects provides a perspective that is broader than the CoP.

Solution Overview
1. Relationships between Existing Workconnects.us 1 Sites
0F

The below diagram represents how the main site and CoPs are related:

1

WorkforceConnects.US will be renamed as "NextGen" or another brand-name chosen by the client. 4 November 2012

RFP_DOL131RP21666

NexGen.gov Functional Requirements ­ Attachment C

2. Taxonomy
There is one taxonomy for the existing Workconnect.us i sites. All resources are assigned tags from the taxonomy, allowing for cross-pollination between sites. The taxonomy contains seven facets: Topics, Target Populations, States/Territories, Programs/Funding Streams, Method of Analysis, Type, and SGA-Related. With the exception of Methods of Analysis, resources are required to have at least one tag from each facet. Methods of Analysis is only applicable for resources in the Workforce Practices Collection, and it is required for these resources.
13F

The taxonomy's facets have varying levels of deepness. Topics has three levels (e.g. Education & Training > Credentials / Competency Models > Industry Skills Standards). Programs, Target Population, and Methodology have two levels (e.g. Programs: U.S. Department of Labor > ARRA High Growth & Emerging Industry Sectors). Date Range, Resource Type, and State/Territory have one level (e.g. State/Territory: Alabama). The taxonomy is content that the CMS Administrator can manage. The taxonomy and additional details are appended to the end of this document.

3. Private Communities of Practice (CoPs)
As the above Venn diagram illustrates, the existing Workconnects.us consists of a main site and CoPs. Some communities of practice are public while others are private. Some private CoPs require a log in while others do not. None of the private CoPs are referenced on the main site, and their resources are not accessible through the main site. Public and private CoPs share the same page templates, taxonomy, and resource types. If a user is a member of a private CoP, this information is displayed in his/her My Workconnects.

4. My Workconnects
Workconnects.us contains My Workconnects; a section of the site that logged in users can customize to meet their needs. The purpose is to allow users to save resources, see their browsing/event histories, create professional networks, etc. My Workconnects contains global information ­ resources saved on all Workconnects.us sites, browsing history from all Workconnects.us sites, etc. When users access My Workconnects from the main site, it is displayed within the main site since it provides a global perspective on what is happening in all Workconnects.us sites. When users access MyWorkconnects from a CoP, it is displayed within the CoP wrapper (not the specific CoP) since My Workconnects provides a perspective that is broader than the CoP. RFP_DOL131RP21666
5 November 2012

NexGen.gov Functional Requirements ­ Attachment C

5. Resource Types
Workconnects.us contains resources that are shared between the main site and private CoPs. The taxonomy that is appended to this document details the resource types. The back-end contains a hierarchy: Audio Document (includes Word, PPT, Excel, and PDF) External Web link Video o ETA Webinar In regard to the Taxonomy : (i) The Resource Detail page only displays the lowest level Resource Type tag, e.g. Online Tutorial NOT Video. (ii) Online Tutorial is an attribute of a resource; Online Tutorial can be of any Resource Type. Therefore, it will not be included in the Resource Type hierarchy in the backend. However, the Resource Template will contain a checkbox for Online Tutorial. If checked, the Resource Type that is displayed on the frontend is Online Tutorial, not Video or Document, etc. On the front-end's Resource Listing Page and Site Search Results pages, a flat list is displayed in the Resource Type facet: Audio Document External Web link Video Online Tutorial ETA Webinar When the user filters by Video, resources tagged with Video or ETA Webinar are displayed. When the users filters by a format (Audio, Document, external Web link, or Video), resources with that format, including those that are Online Tutorials are returned. When the user filters by Online Tutorial, only resources that are Online Tutorials are returned. Resources in the Workforce Practices Collection are not a Resource Type. They are identified by their template ­ WPC Detail ­ and the Methodology tag associated with it. (Only WPC resources have a Methodology tag.)

6. Character Limits
Throughout the FRD, character limits are specified, and they consistently follow the same rules: With the exceptions of Zip Code, Resource Title, and Folder, text fields have a limit of 50 characters o Text fields for zip codes have a limit of 9 characters o Text fields for Resource Title have a limit of 100 characters o Text fields for Folders users create in the My Workconnects section of the site have a limit of 150 characters Text boxes for Bios will have a limit of 1000 characters Text boxes for Bios in the My Workconnects section of the site will have a limit of 1000 characters Text boxes for Description of Resource will have a limit of 2500 characters The comment box will have a limit of 2500 characters

Main Site Global Elements

3. Toolkits & Meetings
Reference Wireframes: Toolkits & Meetings (Generic), Toolkits & Meetings (Resources), Toolkits & Meetings (Types) The Toolkits & Meetings set of page templates will be used to create pages for toolkits and meetings individually as required. The essential difference between a toolkit and a meeting is registration. For meetings, registered users of the site have the option to register for them. Once a meeting has passed, the registration callout is no longer displayed. Resources in a toolkit / meeting will always live in the Resource Library and is required to have at least the 1st-level of the Topic taxonomy, but not with the other taxonomies ­Program, Target Population, etc. Therefore, in that case where a resource is only tagged by a Topic, it will not appear in Resources by Program or filtered using the remaining taxonomy facets. They can only be accessed by browsing and/or searching. Toolkit resources are identified as such when they are linked to a specific toolkit. i.e. they will not require a toolkit ID in the taxonomy . As for toolkit pages, the template identifies the toolkit as being such. i.e. Content admin can create 1) a number of resources in the Resource Library using the Generic Resource Detail Page template, 2) create a new toolkit using the Toolkits & Meetings template and 3) select the resources to include in the new toolkit from the resource library. In doing so, the resources are now linked to a toolkit, hence being identified as toolkit resources. Item Thumbnail Title Wireframes Toolkits & Meetings (Generic), Use Cases Functional Description Toolkit/Meeting logo is displayed; if none exists then a generic image will be displayed. The title of the page is displayed ­ [Toolkit/Meeting Title] Both items are hyperlinked; when clicked will redirect user to the toolkit/resource [About] tab. Both items are administrative controlled content. Tabs will allow users to navigate through the different sections contained within the toolkit/meeting. At minimum, each toolkit/meeting will contain an [About] and [Resources] tab. The toolkit/meeting admin will have the option to add more tabs if needed. (Note: The content manager should
be able to create a page with the need number of tags ­ the goal is to allow creation of tags without having to hire a programmer.)

Participants in sector-focused training programs were more likely to work and, in the second year, worked more consistently than control group members. Employed participants had significantly higher earnings than employed control group members. By the second year, employed program participants were working more hours and were earning higher hourly wages than employed controls. Program participants were significantly more likely to work in jobs that offered benefits. See pp. 6-8. Not included in study.

The following taxonomy, or organizational structures, will be used for the Workforce System Strategies Workforce beta site on Workforce3One, as well as the "Next Gen" replacement of Workforce3One.

1 Topics and Sub-Topics
Content manager must choose AT LEAST ONE of the Sub-Topic Tags (white column) when adding a resource. This will automatically correlate with the corresponding Topic (blue column) and Category (red row). More than one may be selected but sub-topics should be selected carefully and include only those sub-topics with a major presence in the resource. Content managers may nominate new Sub-Topics for review and addition. However, previously entered resources will not be tagged with the new term automatically; updating of tags on previously entered resources will need to be done manually by the Content Manager in order to "catch" those resources when a sub-topic is selected in a filter search.

6 Type
Will be used to code ALL resources in Next Gen. Coding will be manual. The first four are generic format types that should be coded based on the format of the resource being posted. The last two are specific types to be used only in certain instances. [Note: Would it make sense to allow TWO selections for Type ­ e.g., both Video and ETA Webinar? But only certain admins are allowed to code for the last two?] Audio Document External Weblink Video Online Tutorial [Intended for videos, documents or other formats that are designated as tutorials either on how to use the site, or on other topics such as the finance and performance series. Note: This "type" should be set up in permissions so that only certain Admins can use it, so it is not miscoded.] ETA Webinar *Intended only for ETA webinars only. Other agencies' webinars that we may include as resources would be coded video. Note: This "type" should be set up so that only certain Admins can use it so it is not mis-coded.]

7 Pre-SGA Resources
Will be used to code ALL resources in Next Gen. Coding will be manual, with default = No. No (default) Yes [Note: This "type" should be set up in permissions so that only certain Admins can use it, so it is not mis-coded. Manually select, for those webinars and other resources that are posted as TA for a specific SGA in the pre-decision stage. This allows us to count and display popularity of "regular" webinars separately from the webinars involving potential funding, which are by their nature the most popular but are also only of interest during a narrow pre-decision time period.]

(A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For

ATTACHMENT D Wage Determination example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.

ATTACHMENT D Wage Determination If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials

ATTACHMENT D Wage Determination are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms

ATTACHMENT D Wage Determination of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall

ATTACHMENT D Wage Determination be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

ATTACHMENT D Wage Determination 4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.

1.1. SUPPLIES AND SERVICES This requirement is anticipated to result in a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Labor-hour (LH) hybrid contract. The base period and all options shall be priced. 2. STATEMENT OF WORK 2.1. BACKGROUND The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire a web-based content management system and solution and to acquire professional services for development of the replacement web-based Workforce3One.org system through an out-sourced hosted solution with ongoing support for web development, maintenance and operational support. The Workforce3One.org was implemented approximately seven (7) years ago in support of the Office of Workforce Investment (OWI) business objectives, with a major platform upgrade four (4) years ago. The Office of Workforce Investment (OWI) is the office within the Employment and Training Administration responsible for providing national leadership, oversight, policy guidance, and technical assistance to the One-Stop system and the youth and adult employment and training programs funded under the Workforce Investment Act. It oversees the development and implementation of the nation's workforce and economic information system. At the heart of the American Job Centers (formally called One-Stop Career Centers) is the ability to provide services to businesses seeking skilled workers, employment assistance to individuals and workforce and economic information services to all customers. The One Stop delivery system provides universal access to an integrated array of labor exchange services so that workers, job seekers and businesses can find the services they need in one stop and frequently under one roof in easy-to-find locations. In addition, OWI provides similar leadership, oversight, policy guidance and technical assistance related to the Employment Service functions of the Wagner-Peyser Act, which focuses on providing a variety of employment related labor exchange services including but not limited to job search assistance, job referral, and placement assistance for job seekers, re-employment services to unemployment insurance claimants, and recruitment services to employers with job openings.

2.2 SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES: Over the years, the Worforce3One solution has become difficult to manage as a result of legacy technologies and does not offer the same agility as newer CMS platforms currently available in the market. This solution was designed and owned by the government but does not have the advantage of technological advances in system architectural designs and is not interoperable with other products or systems and the interfaces are not completely understood. These limitations and that the system is legacy impact the ability to adapt rapidly and cost efficiently in response to regulatory changes and providing services to meet customer demands. The decision to replace the current solution was spurred by some of the following factors:  Inability to make changes quickly through a controlled approval processes with audit trails ­ lack of content staging to schedule update to production.  Inability to integrate poll functionality into applications.  Friendly look & feel and a faster, better search engine.  Robust security features  Integration with Communities of Practice (CoPs) while maintaining separate, dependent identities.  Input validation mechanism (i.e., Captcha)  Indexing to report statistics on usage, performance and activity through Google Analytics tools is not optimized based on existing architecture and manual site update requirements. In addition, the current solution provides web content management services to its constituents and internally needs a tool that provides the necessary functionality to content authors and reviewers. It has dozens of static pages, plus hundreds of webinar/video and PDF files. This number will continue to grow over time. The DOL-ETA is seeking a solution that will allow for improved quality and cost management as the increase in content ­ and changes within current pages ­ occur over time. It also will provide necessary functionality for the DOL-ETA web presence such as:         Provide communications with more control and timeliness for making content updates (example: current change request process involves many layers including the vendor supporting the website) Live streaming of webinars and podcasts Provide for more cost-effective management of the DOL-ETA e-learning solution. Provide for a communication vehicle, such as allowing for search engine optimization (SEO) benefits including improved and user-generated URLs, better metadata and improved indexing Provide for enhanced usability Empower the Workforce community to assist and communicate with each other Provide necessary business functionality Allow for standard approval process of updating pages

2.8.5.2. DOL IT Security System Requirements

Systems hosted by a third party vendor must meet the same security requirements as a DOL hosted system. As there are dependencies between the system and the hosting facility and supporting network it is common practice that the vendor's supporting facilities should have an authority to operate in place as well as maintain and report on the security posture as defined by Federal Requirements. The activities and resulting deliverable include, but may not be limited to the following: a) Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA): The E-Government Act of 2002 provides additional protection for personal information in government information systems or information collections by requiring that agencies conduct privacy impact assessments. The PIA is an analysis of how information is handled: (i) to ensure handling conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding privacy, (ii) to determine the risks and effects of collecting, maintaining and disseminating information in identifiable form in an electronic information system, and (iii) to examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes for handling information to mitigate potential privacy risks. b) FIPS 199 Security Categorization: FIPS Publication 199 requires agencies to categorize their information systems as low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact for the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.DOL has established a system inventory methodology for ensuring DOL systems are consistently categorized in accordance with FIPS 199 and NIST SP 800-60. In addition to determining the overall system categorization, the system inventory methodology is also used to determine if the system meets the criteria as a major application (MA) or a general support system (GSS). OMB defines a major application as, "an application that requires special attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of the harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in the application." The current Workforce3One.org system was categorized as a "low-impact" system. The minimum security requirements cover seventeen security-related areas with regard to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by those systems. The security-related areas
14 | P a g e January 28, 2013

RFP DOL131RP21666 Web Content Management ATTACHMENT A STATEMENT OF WORK
include: (i) access control; (ii) awareness and training; (iii) audit and accountability; (iv) certification, accreditation, and security assessments; (v) configuration management; (vi) contingency planning; (vii) identification and authentication; (viii) incident response; (ix) maintenance; (x) media protection; (xi) physical and environmental protection; (xii) planning; (xiii) personnel security; (xiv) risk assessment; (xv) systems and services acquisition; (xvi) system and communications protection; and (xvii) system and information integrity. The seventeen areas represent a broad-based, balanced information security program that addresses the management, operational, and technical aspects of protecting federal information and information systems. For cloud-based or cloud-like solutions, the contractor shall support application security lifecycle compliance across all phases of the SDLC and proactively manage, monitor, and update all security artifacts for this solution as required by NIST and Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Through the continuous monitoring phases the deliverables identified below provide an understanding of the solution's security posture and the perceived risk. The frequencies of the deliverables help to identify if changes to the system and/or environment impacting the security controls implemented status and their effectiveness.

However, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253d, the following procedures shall apply prior to canceling or ignoring the markings. (i) The Contracting Officer will make written inquiry to the Contractor affording the Contractor 60 days from receipt of the inquiry to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings; (ii) If the Contractor fails to respond or fails to provide written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the 60-day period (or a longer time approved in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown), the Government shall have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time after said period and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions. (iii) If the Contractor provides written justification to substantiate the propriety of the markings within the period set in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will consider such written justification and determine whether or not the markings are to be cancelled or ignored. If the Contracting Officer determines that the markings are authorized, the Contractor will be so notified in writing. If the Contracting Officer determines, with concurrence of the head of the contracting activity, that the markings are not authorized, the Contracting Officer will furnish the Contractor a written determination, which determination will become the final agency decision regarding the appropriateness of the markings unless the Contractor files suit in a court of competent jurisdiction within 90 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's decision. The Government will continue to abide by the markings under this paragraph (e)(1)(iii) until final resolution of the matter either by the Contracting Officer's determination becoming final (in which instance the Government will thereafter have the right to cancel or ignore the markings at any time and the data will no longer be made subject to any disclosure prohibitions), or by final disposition of the matter by court decision if suit is filed. (2) The time limits in the procedures set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this clause may be modified in accordance with agency regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if necessary to respond to a request thereunder. (3) Except to the extent the Government's action occurs as the result of final disposition of the matter by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Contractor is not precluded by paragraph (e) of the clause from bringing a claim, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, that may arise as the result of the Government removing or ignoring authorized markings on data delivered under this contract. (f) Omitted or incorrect markings.

E-3

DOL131RP21666

Section E

specific functionality. Failure to complete Attachments B, C, and G will result in an overall unacceptable Technical Rating. Proprietary information shall be clearly identified.

TAB B Technical Approach The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. The offeror shall describe in detail no more than twenty (20) pages, excluding responses to work books, cover letter and resumes: Understanding of the management and implementation requirements, based on the Data Migration and Conversion Requirements, Project Managements and SDLCM Implementation Plan and Approach, Quality of Key personnel, Training, Operations and Maintenance and Help Desk Support.

Proposals that fail to receive a trating of "pass" will no longer be considered in the subsequent evaluation stages. Pass/Fail Factors (each of equal importance) Security Approach The offeror shall describe in detail to include artifacts such as diagrams, figures and tables, their recommended approach for meeting the statement of work security requirements, not to exceed five (5) pages. Factor 1: Security Responses If an offerors' proposal does not include responses to all of the questions listed in the work books, then that offeror's proposal will be deemed "Non-Responsive," and as a result will be determined to be "Technically Unacceptable." Factor 2: IT Security Requirements Attachment F (Information Assurance Compliance) must be completed by inserting the appropriate response in relation to each item. The offeror shall complete the MS Excel worksheets included in the attachment entitled, "Information Security Compliance." Responses are excluded from the five (5) page limitation. The three (3) worksheets are entitled: Tab1-FISMA Compliant ATO Tab 2-Mandatory 800-53 Ctrls Tab 3-Other 800-53 Crls For all worksheets, Offerors must provide a response to each question and security control using the yellow highlighted cells. Any unpopulated yellow highlighted cells will be considered a non-response and will be evaluated as such. Where available, Offerors must respond using the provided drop down-menus or respond in
E-4

DOL131RP21666

Section E

accordance with the instructions provided in the adjacent cells. The security controls are based on NIST SP 800-53 Revision 3. When completing Tab 1 - FISMA Compliant ATO, Offeror must provide copies (as part of their response for their solution) of ALL applicable: 1. FISMA Security Authorization letters or documents authorizing operation, or 2. Letter(s) signed by a senior executive official certifying that the Offeror is actively pursuing a Security Authorization of the proposed solutions. When completing Tab 2 - Mandatory 800-53 Ctrls, Offeror must indicate the implementation status for each NIST 800-53 control under the "Implemented" column. Under the "Compliance Remarks" column, Offeror must describe how each control is implemented or planned to be implemented should the entire control or part of the control is not be implemented. Response for each Compliance Remark is limited to 512 characters. When completing Tab 3 - Other 800-53 Controls, Offeror must indicate the implementation status for each NIST 800-53 control under the "Implemented" column. Security Posture and Compliance Evaluation Offeror's shall pass the FISMA Criteria for the evaluators to continue on to the other security posture and compliance areas for evaluation. The outcome of the NIST and extended security controls will use a high watermark method to summarize the results of the offeror's security posture. Thus each section will be evaluated and the results recorded. A high watermark dictates that the outcome of each area is identified and the highest rating given of all areas is considered to be the overall rating for the offeror's security posture. FISMA Grading Criteria The offeror's FISMA submission will be evaluated on the proposed solutions Authority to Operate (ATO) status. Security Control Grading Criteria Primarily the security controls baseline is derived from the NIST SP 800-53 (current version) Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations at a Moderate impact level. Consideration was also given to include the FedRAMP additional requirements and guidance for the NIST SP 800-53 controls. The Government took an additional step to include a group of Extended Security Compliance items that support Government security related requirements that may not have been addressed in the other security posture and compliance elements. Offeror's determined as being acceptable, is at low risk of potential compromise of the Government Information Technology (IT) assets will be considered acceptable for further evaluation. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's response for the mandatory and extended (EXT) control responses to determine that the offeror has the control implemented, or planned for implementation, and understands the security control. The Government will evaluate the "Other 800-53 Control" section to identify the implementation status by the Offeror. VOLUME III - MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES The following two factors are of equal importance: FACTOR I - MANAGEMENT PLAN ­ The Contractor's response shall describe their management plan.

EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (End of Addendum to 52.212-1)

JUL 1990

E.6 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2-EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS Basis for Award. The Government will award a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, Hybrid Fixed Price Contract to include flexibility for Labor Hour Contract Line Items (CLINs), from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government,with appropriate consideration given to the five (6) volumes: {Technical, , IT Security, Management Capabilities, Experience, Past Performance, and Price}. The Contracting Officer mayalso conduct a price analysis in accordance with the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than Volume V, Price. However, price may become more important as non-price factors approach equality. Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Volume I, and its associated Factors). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public
interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: Factor I, Technical is significantly more important than Factor II, IT Security, which is [how much] more important than Factor 3 Management Capability, which is [how much] more important than Factor 4 Experience and Past Performance. When combined, the Non-Price Factors are significantly more important than Factor IV "Price". However, as offerors ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor IV "Price" may become more important in the award decision. (a) Duration of Business Arrangement: The period of performance of this contract will be five years. This contract is not considered to be for advisory or assistance services in accordance with FAR Part 37.2. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

E-13

DOL131RP21666

Section E

The COTR will conduct performance evaluations based upon the baseline service level agreements and performance standards established with the execution of the contract. The following techniques will be used to perform surveillance: Progress Against Schedule - The COTR will review schedule performance reporting to ensure that the services provided are on-target to meet key SOW milestones/objectives.  Inspections - DOL and Contractor PMO staff will conduct 100% inspections of deliverables for accuracy and completeness, including comprehensive phase-end reviews. Results of the inspections will be documented, and the COTR will review these results for compliance with the SOW. All associated SDLCM phase based deliverables must be accepted, including the phase end review, prior to phase end invoices being authorized. (End of provision) E.9 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS The contractor, in its response, must identify any and all clauses proposed by the government (including data rights clauses) to which it takes exception, whether based upon the terms of the underlying solicitation or otherwise. If the contractor does not specify any clauses to which it takes exception, it is presumed that the contractor agrees to adhere to the government's special clauses; and the terms of the special clauses will be deemed to take precedence over any potentially conflicting clauses within the underlying Federal Supply Schedule Contract. Further, any exceptions taken by the contractor may adversely impact the contractor's rating and may result in a contractor being removed from consideration for award.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

Section E

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed End Product Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:

(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] [_] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. [_] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The

(Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-- (1) [_] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or (2) [_] Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] (1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-- (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. (2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-- (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and

(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

specific functionality. Failure to complete Attachments B, C, and G will result in an overall unacceptable Technical Rating. Proprietary information shall be clearly identified.

TAB B Technical Approach The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. The offeror shall describe in detail no more than twenty (20) pages, excluding responses to work books, cover letter and resumes: Understanding of the management and implementation requirements, based on the Data Migration and Conversion Requirements, Project Managements and SDLCM Implementation Plan and Approach, Quality of Key personnel, Training, Operations and Maintenance and Help Desk Support. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. VOLUME II ­ IT SECURITY This volume will be rated on a PASS/FAIL basis. It is mandatory to provide responses to all the questions. Failure to receive a rating of pass, offerors will no longer be considered in the subsequent evaluation stages. Based on its evaluation, DOL may then establish a competitive range. Pass/Fail Factors Security Approach The offeror shall describe in detail to include artifacts such as diagrams, figures and tables, their recommended approach for meeting the statement of work security requirements, not to exceed five (5) pages. Security Responses If an offerors' proposal does not include responses to all of the questions listed in the work books, then that offeror's proposal will be deemed "Non-Responsive," and as a result will be determined to be "Technically Unacceptable." IT SECURITY REQUIREMENTS Attachment F (Information Assurance Compliance) must be completed by inserting the appropriate response in relation to each item. The offeror shall complete the MS Excel worksheets included in the attachment entitled, "Information Security Compliance." Responses are excluded from the five (5) page limitation. The three (3) worksheets are entitled: Tab1-FISMA Compliant ATO Tab 2-Mandatory 800-53 Ctrls Tab 3-Other 800-53 Crls For all worksheets, Offerors must provide a response to each question and security control using the yellow highlighted cells. Any unpopulated yellow highlighted cells will be considered a non-response and will be evaluated as such. Where available, Offerors must respond using the provided drop down-menus or respond in
E-4

DOL131RP21666

Section E

accordance with the instructions provided in the adjacent cells. The security controls are based on NIST SP 800-53 Revision 3. When completing Tab 1 - FISMA Compliant ATO, Offeror must provide copies (as part of their response for their solution) of ALL applicable: 1. FISMA Security Authorization letters or documents authorizing operation, or 2. Letter(s) signed by a senior executive official certifying that the Offeror is actively pursuing a Security Authorization of the proposed solutions. When completing Tab 2 - Mandatory 800-53 Ctrls, Offeror must indicate the implementation status for each NIST 800-53 control under the "Implemented" column. Under the "Compliance Remarks" column, Offeror must describe how each control is implemented or planned to be implemented should the entire control or part of the control is currently not be implemented. Response for each Compliance Remark is limited to 512 characters. When completing Tab 3 - Other 800-53 Controls, Offeror must indicate the implementation status for each NIST 800-53 control under the "Implemented" column. Security Posture and Compliance Evaluation Offeror's shall pass the FISMA Criteria for the evaluators to continue on to the other security posture and compliance areas for evaluation. The outcome of the NIST and extended security controls will use a high watermark method to summarize the results of the offeror's security posture. Thus each section will be evaluated and the results recorded. A high watermark dictates that the outcome of each area is identified and the highest rating given of all areas is considered to be the overall rating for the offeror's security posture. FISMA Grading Criteria The offeror's FISMA submission will be evaluated on the proposed solutions Authority to Operate (ATO) status. Offeror's determined as "acceptable" meets the Government's ability to use a solution that meets the Government's Federal compliancy requirements by the time identified will be considered acceptable for further evaluation. Security Control Grading Criteria Primarily the security controls baseline is derived from the NIST SP 800-53 (current version) Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations at a Moderate impact level. Consideration was also given to include the FedRAMP additional requirements and guidance for the NIST SP 800-53 controls. The Government took an additional step to include a group of Extended Security Compliance items that support Government security related requirements that may not have been addressed in the other security posture and compliance elements. Offeror's determined as being acceptable, is at low risk of potential compromise of the Government Information Technology (IT) assets will be considered acceptable for further evaluation. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's response for the mandatory and extended (EXT) control responses to determine that the offeror has the control implemented, or planned for implementation, and understands the security control. The Government will evaluate the "Other 800-53 Control" section to identify the implementation status by the Offeror. VOLUME III - MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES

EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (End of Addendum to 52.212-1)

JUL 1990

E.6 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2-EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS Basis for Award. The Government will award a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, Hybrid Fixed Price Contract to include flexibility for Labor Hour Contract Line Items (CLINs), from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is most advantageous to the Government based on the best overall proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government, with appropriate consideration given to the five (6) volumes: {Technical, Management Capabilities, IT Security Requirements, Past Performance, and Price}. Factor I, Technical is significantly more important than Factor IV, Past Performance. All Factors under Volume I, Technical are of equal importance. The Contracting Officer shall also conduct a price analysis in accordance with the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than Volume V, Price. However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Volume I, and its associated Factors). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government

may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive Pursuant to FAR 15.306(c) the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for reasons of efficiency. Pursuant to FAR 52.215-1(f) (4), the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Offerors will be required to submit a technical and price proposal and will be evaluated against five (6) Volumes. To determine which firm represents the best value, the offers will be evaluated as outlined below. VOLUME I: TECHNICAL Technical Factor 1 Workbook Responses The technical proposal shall include the technical approach and responses to Attachments B, C, and G. Attachments shall be completed by inserting the appropriate response in relation to each item.

Adjectival ratings will be used for Volume I, Technical and Volume III Management Capabilities. Factor IV Past Performance ratings will be used from Table 2: Past Performance Adjectival Scale below. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor V, Price. Volume II Security will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.

Volume I- Technical, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale ADJECTIVAL Outstanding DEFINITION A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.

Unknown Risk

Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: Factor I, Technical is significantly more important than Factor IV, Past Performance, which when combined, the Non-Price Factors are significantly more important than Factor V "Price". However, as offerors ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor V "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision. (a) Duration of Business Arrangement: The period of performance of this contract will be five years. This contract is not considered to be for advisory or assistance services in accordance with FAR Part 37.2. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision)
E.7 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

The Government reserves the right to establish baseline service level agreements and performance standards with the awarded contractor as part of the proposal process, and modify service level agreements and performance standards and/or metrics during the life of this contract, in order to ensure that the right outcomes are being assessed and that the performance standards are appropriate. Any changes to service level agreements and performance standards will be accomplished via a bilateral contract modification. E.8 EVALUATION METHODS The COTR will conduct performance evaluations based upon the baseline service level agreements and performance standards established with the execution of the contract. The following techniques will be used to perform surveillance:

DOL131RP21666

Section E

Progress Against Schedule - The COTR will review schedule performance reporting to ensure that the services provided are on-target to meet key SOW milestones/objectives.  Inspections - DOL and Contractor PMO staff will conduct 100% inspections of deliverables for accuracy and completeness, including comprehensive phase-end reviews. Results of the inspections will be documented, and the COTR will review these results for compliance with the SOW. All associated SDLCM phase based deliverables must be accepted, including the phase end review, prior to phase end invoices being authorized. (End of provision) E.9 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS The contractor, in its response, must identify any and all clauses proposed by the government (including data rights clauses) to which it takes exception, whether based upon the terms of the underlying solicitation or otherwise. If the contractor does not specify any clauses to which it takes exception, it is presumed that the contractor agrees to adhere to the government's special clauses; and the terms of the special clauses will be deemed to take precedence over any potentially conflicting clauses within the underlying Federal Supply Schedule Contract. Further, any exceptions taken by the contractor may adversely impact the contractor's rating and may result in a contractor being removed from consideration for award.
