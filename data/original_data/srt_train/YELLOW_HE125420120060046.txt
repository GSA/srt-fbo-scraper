STATEMENT OF WORK

ONLINE COURSES On Differentiated Instruction
1 1.1 INTRODUCTION The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees by providing PK-12 instruction to approximately 87,000 students in seven states, twelve foreign countries, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The number of students varies based on the deployment of military troops worldwide. DoDEA's curriculum, resources, and student achievement scores on standardized assessments compare favorably to high-performing US public schools. 1.2 DoDEA is divided into three administrative areas. DDESS (Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools) covers the schools in seven states and Puerto Rico, and for administrative purposes, Cuba. DoDDS (Department of Defense Dependent Schools) is divided into DoDDSEurope and DoDDS-Pacific. The former administers the schools in England, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and Bahrain. The latter covers the schools in Korea, Japan, and for administrative purposes, Guam. DoDEA also operates a fully accredited Virtual High School with its main office in Virginia and teaching hubs in Germany and Korea. 2 2.1 BACKGROUND DoDEA provides sustained professional development to all of its educators. It is often focused on specific curricular areas and aimed at particular groups of educators. 2.2 DoDEA is in the process of planning comprehensive professional development on differentiating instruction for students that will be presented to all DoDEA teachers and administrators. 2.3 The DoDEA Differentiated Instruction conceptual framework provides the 5 key tenets of differentiation as follows: invigorating learning environments; on-going assessment and data; respectful, challenging learning tasks; high quality curriculum; and flexible grouping. Following these tenets, teachers determine the content, process, and product through planned instruction and assessment. Through intentional planning, teachers determine the strategies that support students' readiness, interest, and learning style in order to maximize their growth. Differentiated Instruction provides all educators with a process for reflecting on their beliefs about teaching and learning in order to respond to the diverse needs of all learners. This approach asks teachers to:  be clear about what is important to know and do with the subject matter

    

understand, appreciate, and build upon student differences understand that assessment and instruction are inseparable adjust instruction in response to student readiness, interests, and learning style embrace flexibility as the hallmark of a differentiated classroom reach the goal of a differentiated classroom - obtaining maximum student growth and individual success (Tomlinson, 2002, Differentiating Instruction for Academic Diversity)

2.4 

The Differentiated Instruction Tenets are as follows: Invigorating Learning Environments Maximize Each Student's Growth and Individual Success. Learning environments ignite the interests and passion of students to learn and are communities where individual differences are honored and fundamental to the teaching and learning experience. Invigorating learning environments are student-centered and characterized by individual and collaborative learning, active student participation in learning, and a focus on student interests and needs. They encourage positive social interaction and self-motivation. They differentiate instruction Â­all of the time.



On-going Assessment and Data Are Essential Instructional Tools. Student performance data and ongoing assessments are used to plan, direct and differentiate instruction. Continuous assessment, both formative and summative, engages learners in their own growth; provides students with specific information about their performance in a way that helps them improve; monitors learners' progress; and guides teacher and learner decision making.



Learning Tasks Are Respectful, Challenging, Inviting, and Thought-Provoking for All Students. Students exposed to engaging work develop and deepen their understanding of content, build their critical and creative thinking competencies, and experience more meaningful learning experiences. In differentiated classrooms, instruction is designed to provide all students stimulating and challenging tasks and abundant opportunities to demonstrate their learning in different ways. Students in these classrooms become active and responsive explorers. Student learning experiences meeting the yardstick of this tenet allow all students the opportunity to flourish and succeed.



Access to High Quality Curriculum Deepens Learning. Curriculum, instructional materials, differentiated instruction, and teacher and student behaviors all combine to make content accessible for all students. This tenet relies upon disciplined and deliberate articulation of what we want students to know and be able to do, how we know when they have learned, what we will do when they have not learned, and what we will do when they have exceeded the learning

expectations. There is an obvious line-of-sight from the student tasks and objectives to the content standards and learning goals. There are explicit goals in lesson designs that apply content knowledge to real-world problems, connect concepts, use differing perspectives, and encourage critical and creative thinking and collaborative problem-solving. Students are challenged -- all of the time.  Flexible Grouping is Consistently Used to Drive and Deepen Student Growth and Achievement. Learners are expected to interact and work together as they develop knowledge of new content. As one of the tenets of differentiated instruction, flexible grouping which is intentional grouping and regrouping must be a dynamic process, changing the content, project and on-going assessments to meet the diverse student needs. Groups of students are not fixed. Teachers may conduct whole-class discussions of the content's big ideas followed by small group or paired work. Student groups are coached from within the group or by the teacher to complete assignments. Appropriate instructional strategies and resources are used to flex instruction to the needs of individual and groups of learners. 3 3.1 SCOPE For professional development purposes, DoDEA requires a contractor to provide a minimum of four existing differentiated instruction online courses for teachers and administrators. 4 REQUIREMENTS:

ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION Relative Importance of Factors. The Government will award a contract resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the most advantageous to the Government; price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: Technical Capability, Past Performance and Price. When combined Technical Capability and Past Performance are significantly more important than price. Pass-Fail Technology Review Pass: The Offeror's technology components, which will be evaluated by the Government, meet the information security and technology requirements criteria listed in the Performance Work Statement. Fail: If any of the Offeror's technology components fails to meet DoDEA's information security and technology requirements, such component shall be excluded from further evaluation. FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL CAPABILITY

a. Technical Capability Â­ This evaluation will evaluate the offerors by the proposals received in response to the Online Course on Differentiated Instruction Request for Proposals using the following factors:
       To what extent does each course align to the principles of Differentiated Instruction (DI) which include but are not limited to the following that all teachers use. Course goals, representative of the scope of the course and clearly stated. Sufficient rigor, depth and breadth to address DoDEA teachers' needs to practice DI in their classroom. To what extent does each course provide pre- and post-assessment for each online course that adequately measure mastery of content? To what extent does each course meet DoDEA's requirements (1) to cover broad, cross-curricular DI topics and (2) to address teachers' DI needs by grade band, content, and position? Course content reflects best available research and practice about differentiated learning for teaching, learning and leadership. Includes excellent integration of differentiated learning and content/curriculum-related topics, readings and activities that provide teachers with authentic information and applications to course content. Enables teachers to develop further expertise in integrating differentiated instruction and subject content, teaching strategies, use of technologies and other essential elements in teaching, learning and leadership. Consists of stand-alone (learning objectives) lessons with no references or dependency on previous or future lessons that teachers can adapt/provide differentiated instruction to address student learning needs.





b. Order of Importance Â­ The order of importance of these factors is Technical, Past Performance and Price. When combined Technical and Past Performance are significantly more important than price. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The SSEB shall conduct an in-depth review of each proposal against the factors and subfactors established in the solicitation, and assign evaluation ratings. Technical Rating Evaluation. The technical rating reflects the degree to which the proposed approach meets or does not meet the minimum performance or capability requirements through an assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies, and risks of a proposal. A combined technical/risk rating includes consideration of risk in conjunction with the strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies in determining technical ratings. Combined technical/risk evaluations shall utilize the combined technical/risk ratings listed in Table 1. Table 1. Combined Technical/Risk Ratings Color Rating Description Blue Excellent Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. Purple Good Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low. Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate. Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable.

Unacceptable

FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE Past Performance Evaluation. The past performance evaluation will result in an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the solicitation requirements. The past performance evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet the contract's requirements. One performance confidence assessment rating is assigned for each offeror after evaluating the offeror's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements. See FAR 15.305. There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation. The first is to evaluate the offeror's past performance to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the offeror is to the effort to be acquired through the source selection. The criteria to establish what is recent and relevant shall be unique to each source selection and shall be stated in the solicitation. In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to those aspects of an offeror's contract history that would have the greatest ability to measure whether the offeror

will satisfy the current procurement. Common aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree of subcontract/teaming. Table 2. Past Performance Relevancy Ratings Rating Relevant Definition Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

Not Relevant

The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts. Sources of Past Performance Information for Evaluation are as follows: Ë Past performance information shall be obtained from questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of the acquisition. Ë Past performance information shall be obtained from any other sources available to the government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers, and Fee Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency. The PCO will review this past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance confidence assessment.  Performance Confidence Assessment. In conducting a performance confidence assessment, each offeror shall be assigned one of the ratings in Table 3. (Reference FAR 15.305(2) for information on assigning an unknown/neutral confidence rating.)

Table 3. Performance Confidence Assessments Rating Substantial Confidence Description Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will

Satisfactory Confidence

successfully perform the required effort. Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.

No Confidence

Unknown Confidence (Neutral) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

FACTOR 3: PRICE CONTRACT PRICE The Price proposals will be evaluated separately by the Contract Specialist to ensure price reasonableness for the services being provided to the Government, considering the specific terms and conditions and relevant commercial practices.

The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; and (2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS

Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)
