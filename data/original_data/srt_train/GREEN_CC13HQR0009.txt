Table of Contents





































INTRODUCTION

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is developed pursuant to the requirements listed in the performance-based Performance Work Statement (PWS).  This performance-based plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will use in evaluating the technical performance of the service provider.



1.1 Purpose

The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to measure performance and to identify the reports required and the resources to be employed.  The QASP provides a means for evaluating whether the service provider is meeting the performance standards identified in the PWS.



This QASP is designed to define roles and responsibilities, identify the performance objectives, define the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the service provider’s performance, describe quality assurance reporting, and describe the analysis of quality assurance monitoring results.



1.2 Performance Management Approach

The performance-based PWS structures the acquisition around “what” service is required as opposed to “how” the service provider should perform the work.  This QASP will define the performance management approach taken by OCC to monitor, manage, and take appropriate action on the service provider’s performance against expected performance objectives communicated in the PWS.  Performance management rests upon developing a capability to review and analyze information generated through performance metrics.  The ability to make decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of performance management.  The data generated in a performance management approach provides information that indicates whether the service provider is achieving expected outcomes for required services adequately.



Performance management also represents a significant shift from the more traditional Quality Assurance (QA) concepts in several ways.  Performance management focuses on assessing whether or not outcomes are being achieved and migrates away from scrutiny on compliance with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome.  The only exceptions to process reviews are those required by law (Federal, State, and local) and compelling business situations such as safety and security.  An outcome focus provides the service provider flexibility to continuously improve and innovate over the course of the contract as long as the critical outcomes expected are being achieved at the desired levels of performance.



1.3 Performance Management Strategy

The service provider’s Quality Control Plan (QCP) will set forth the staffing and procedures for self-inspecting the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements in the PWS.  The service provider will develop and implement a performance management system with processes to assess and report their performance to the designated Government representative.



The Government representative will monitor performance and review performance reports furnished by the service provider to determine how the service provider is performing against communicated performance objectives.  The Government will make decisions based on performance measurement metric data and notify the service provider of those decisions.  The service provider will be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to ensure performance is managed effectively.



ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES



2.1 Contracting Officer (CO) 

The Contracting Officer (CO) is responsible for monitoring contract compliance, contract administration and cost control; and resolving any differences between the observations documented by the Contracting Officer Representative, and the service provider’s performance.  The CO will designate one full-time COR as the Government authority for performance management. 



2.2 Contracting Officer Representative (COR)  

The COR is responsible for monitoring, assessing, and communicating the technical performance of the service provider and assisting the service provider.  The COR will have the responsibility for completing QA monitoring forms (refer to sample Exhibits II and III) used to document the inspection and evaluation of the service provider’s work performance.  Government surveillance may occur under the Inspection of Services clause for any service relating to the contract.



IDENTIFICATION OF SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED

The service provider shall provide Learning Content Management System and other specific services in accordance with the PWS.



Section 23 of the PWS lists the performance requirements, the performance standards that are tied to specific areas in the PWS, the acceptable level of performance, and the method of surveillance.



METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE

Surveillance techniques shall be used by the Government to evaluate service provider performance. The primary methods of surveillance are random checks, observations, inspections, feedback, and review of the records and files that are required to be maintained and delivered under this PWS.  The Government will use appointed representatives, as well as reports and input from OCC employees as sources of comments on the service provider’s performance.



The service provider is expected to establish and maintain professional communication between its employees and customers.  The primary objective of professional communication between employees and customers is customer satisfaction.  Customer satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through customer feedback.  Performance management drives the service provider to be customer focused through initially addressing customer feedback and investigating any issues and/or problems.





NOTE: The customer always has the option to communicate feedback to the COR as opposed to the service provider.  The COR will accept the customer feedback and will investigate using the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form – Customer Feedback Investigation identified in Exhibit III.

The performance standards located in Exhibit I, Service Performance Summary, for service provider performance are structured to allow the service provider to manage how the work is performed while providing incentives for performance that exceeds the performance standards and disincentives for failures.  Levels of performance are keyed to the relative importance of the task to the overall effectiveness of support provided.



QUALITY ASSURANCE REPORTING

The performance management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected outcomes.  Performance standards are expressed in the PWS and measured by the required performance standards in Exhibit I.



The Government’s QA monitoring, accomplished by the COR, will be reported using the sample monitoring forms in Exhibits II and III or similar forms.  The forms, when completed, will document the COR’s understanding of the service provider’s performance under the contract to ensure that the PWS requirements are being met.



The COR will retain a copy of all completed QA monitoring forms. 



ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE MONITORING RESULTS

The Government shall use the observation methods cited to determine whether the performance standards have been met.  The Government will evaluate the results and assess if the performance standards have been met to determine if an incentive or disincentive should be applied.



Upon request from the CO, the COR will prepare a written report for the CO summarizing the overall results of the quality assurance monitoring of the service provider’s performance.  This written report, which consists of the service provider’s submitted monthly report and the completed Quality Assurance Monitoring Forms (Exhibit II), will become part of the QA documentation.



The COR may require the service provider’s Project Manager, or a designated alternate, to meet with the CO and other Government personnel as deemed necessary to discuss performance evaluation.  The COR will define a frequency of in-depth reviews with the service provider, however if the need arises, the service provider will meet with the COR as often as required or at the service provider’s request.  The agenda of the review meetings may include:



Monthly performance measured by the metrics and trends 

Issues and concerns of both parties 

Projected outlook for upcoming months and progress against expected trends 

Recommendations made by the COR based on service provider information 

Issues arising from independent reviews and inspections 



In addition to QA monitoring, the COR will use the information contained in the service provider’s monthly report to assess the service provider’s level of performance for each objective measured in this QASP (detailed in Exhibit I).  The COR must coordinate and communicate with the service provider to resolve issues and concerns of marginal or unacceptable performance.  The service provider will discuss satisfaction ratings receiving a “less than acceptable” rating with the COR.  For such cases, the service provider should highlight its perspective on factors driving customer satisfaction and present plans to adjust service levels accordingly to bring the satisfaction rating up to an acceptable level.



The COR and service provider should jointly formulate tactical and long-term courses of action.  Decisions regarding changes to metrics, thresholds, or service levels should be clearly documented.  Changes to service levels, procedures, and metrics will be incorporated as a contract modification at the convenience of the CO.



FAILURE TO PERFORM

The service provider may receive disincentives or even termination based on failure to perform.  The following criteria apply for determining appropriate action:

Notifications.  Consistent with FAR Part 49, the CO shall notify the service provider of failure to meet standards through QA monitoring forms, cure notices, or show cause notices and shall inform the service provider or designated alternate of such notices. 

Deductions.  The Government has the right to apply disincentives for failure to meet performance standards.  The specific disincentives are identified in the Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) in Exhibit I. 

Termination.  If the CO determines the service provider has failed to perform to the extent that a termination for default is justified, the CO shall issue a notice of termination, consistent with FAR Part 49. 

Incentive/Disincentives for Meeting/Not Meeting AQL

Positive or negative performance will be documented 

Non compliance to contract standards will be corrected at no cost to the government

The service provider may receive informal or formal acknowledgement for exceptional performance in the form of certificates or letters.



Notification. The service provider shall respond in writing to the Contracting Officer, to all notifications of failure to meet Acceptable Quality Levels within 3 days of issuance by the Contracting Officer.  The service provider’s response shall include the corrective action taken to rectify the problem and the proposed measure to preclude the recurrence of the problem.

Attachment 1

CONDITIONAL ACCESS TO SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED INFORMATION

 NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT



I, _______________, hereby consent to the terms in this Agreement in consideration of my being granted conditional access to certain United States Government documents or material containing sensitive but unclassified information.



I understand and agree to the following terms and conditions:



1.	By being granted conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information, the United States Government has placed special confidence and trust in me and I am obligated to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.



              2.	As used in this Agreement, sensitive but unclassified information is any information, the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or unauthorized disclosure or modification of which could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs including information covered by 18 U.S.C.  1905 and 1906, or the proprietary interests of national banks or their customers or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under Title 5 U.S.C.  552a, but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.



3.	I am being granted conditional access contingent upon my execution of this Agreement for the sole purpose of work performed under Contract No. _____________________.  This approval will permit me conditional access to certain information, including but not limited to, documents, memoranda, reports and/or to attend meetings in which such information is discussed or otherwise made available to me.  This Agreement will not allow me access to materials which the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has predetermined, in its sole discretion, is inappropriate for disclosure pursuant to this Agreement.  This may include sensitive but unclassified information provided to the OCC by other agencies of the United States Government.



4.	I will never divulge any sensitive but unclassified information which is provided to me pursuant to this Agreement to any person, unless I have been advised in writing by the OCC that the individual is authorized to receive it.  Unless expressly authorized by the OCC, I will not use any sensitive but unclassified information for any commercial or other purpose other than that for which access to such information is provided under Contract No. _____________________.    I agree that I must seek and obtain the prior written approval of the OCC for any proposed disclosure or use.  



Additionally, I will submit to the OCC for security review, prior to any submission for publication, any book, article, column or other written work for general publication that is based upon any knowledge I obtained during the course of my work on Contract No. _____________________ in order for the OCC to ensure that no sensitive but unclassified information is disclosed.



5.	I hereby assign to the United States Government all royalties, remunerations, and emoluments that have resulted, will result or may result from any disclosure, publication, or revelation of sensitive but unclassified information not consistent with the terms of this Agreement.



6.	If I am permitted, at the sole discretion of the OCC, to review any official documents containing sensitive but unclassified information, such review will be conducted at a secure facility or under circumstances which will maintain the security protection of such material.  I will not be permitted to and will not make any copies of documents or parts of documents to which conditional access is granted to me.  Any notes taken during the course of such access will remain at the OCC to be placed in secure storage unless it is determined by OCC officials that the notes contain no sensitive but unclassified information.  If I wish to have the notes released to me, OCC officials will review the notes for purposes of deleting any sensitive but unclassified information to create a redacted copy of the notes.  If I do not wish a review of any notes that I make, those notes will remain sealed in secure storage at the OCC.



7.	If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, I understand that the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive but unclassified information could compromise the mission and security of the OCC.



8.	If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such violation may result in the cancellation of my conditional access to sensitive but unclassified information.  This may serve as a basis for denying me conditional access to OCC information, both classified and sensitive but unclassified, in the future. If I violate the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the United States may institute a civil action for damages or any other appropriate relief.  The willful disclosure of information to which I have agreed therein not to divulge may constitute a criminal offense.



9.	Unless and until I am provided a written release by the OCC from this Agreement or any portions of it, all conditions and obligations contained in this Agreement apply both during my period of conditional access, which shall terminate at the conclusion of my work on Contract No. _____________________, and at all times thereafter.



10.	Each provision of this Agreement is severable.  If a court should find any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.



11.	I understand that the United States Government may seek any remedy available to it to enforce this Agreement, including, but not limited to, application for a court order prohibiting use or disclosure of information in breach of this Agreement.



12.	By granting me conditional access to information in this context, the United States Government does not waive any statutory or common law evidentiary privileges or protections that it may assert in any administrative or court proceedings to protect any sensitive but unclassified information to which I have been given conditional access under the terms of this Agreement.



13.	These restrictions are consistent with and do not supersede, conflict with , or otherwise alter the employee obligations, rights or liabilities created by Executive order 12356; Section 7211 of Title 5, United States Code (governing disclosures to Congress); Section 1034 of Title 10, United States Code, as amended by the Military Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosure to Congress by members of the military); Section 2302(b)(8) of Title 5, United States Code, as amended by the Whistleblower Protection Act (governing disclosures of illegality, waste, fraud, abuse or public health and safety threats); the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 (50 U.S.C. 421 et seq.)(governing disclosures that could expose confidential Government agents), and the statutes which protect against disclosure that may compromise the national security, including Sections 641, 793, 794, 798, and 952 of Title 18, United States Code, and Section 4(b) of the Subversive Activities Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. Section 783(b)).  The definitions, requirements, obligations, rights, sanctions and liabilities created by the Executive Order and listed statutes are incorporated into this Agreement and are controlling.



14.	I will comply with the restrictions on disclosure of suspicious activity reports as set forth in 31 USC 5318(g)(2)(A) by not disclosing any information on or related to suspicious transactions and suspicious activity reports.



15.	My execution of this Agreement shall not nullify or affect in any manner any other secrecy or nondisclosure Agreement which I have executed or may execute with the United States Government.



I make this Agreement in good faith, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requires all service providers to have an information se curity program that provides management, operational, and technical safeguards designed to protect OCC data. This publication is based on security control requirements established by Federal Information Process ing Standard (FIPS) Publication 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems." Once completed, this self assessment will be analyzed by OCC information Risk Management personnel to provide the OCC's contracting officer with a preliminary assessment of the respondents' security program. OCC's analysis will rely on the quality and completeness of the information provided. OCC Risk Management person nel will conduct further analyses, review, and testing of the apparent winning bidder's security control environment based on a full set of control requirements. Explanation of terms, concepts, and other items related to federal information security requirements can be found in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section of this publication.

4. Frequently Asked Questions
(1)  Why does the OCC require its service providers to complete this self assessment questionnaire? (5)  How does the government define "security control"? The E-Government Act of 2002 and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directives require that all information systems that process government information maintain adequate security. "Adequate security" is commensurate with the harm that would result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of information. Adequate security ensures that systems and applications operate effectively and provide appropriate measures of confidentiality, integrity, and availability through the use of managerial, operational, and technical security controls. This requirement applies to all information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the government, including those provided or managed by another government agency, contractor, or other source. (2)  What does "information security" mean? "Information security" is protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. (3)  What does "information system" mean? An information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, transmission, and dissemination of information, in accordance with defined procedures, whether automated or manual. (4)  What do the terms "confidentiality, integrity and availability" mean? The OCC's information security controls are based on Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 200. Security controls are the management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a system and its information. Management controls focus on the management of risk and the management of information system security. Operational controls are those safeguards that are primarily implemented and executed by people (as opposed to systems). Technical controls are primarily implemented and executed by an information system through mechanisms in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system. (6)  What is FIPS 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems," and where can I find more information about it?

That publication is a mandatory standard (it cannot be waived) developed in response to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002. The combination of FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 establishes the foundation for most federal information security practices and procedures. (7)  What is NIST Special Publication (SP) 80053, Revision II, "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems," December 2007 and where can I find more information on it?

Confidentiality is preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. Integrity is protecting information from improper modification or destruction, and includes ensuring that information is authentic and reliable. Availability is ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.

That publication provides guidelines for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems supporting the executive agencies of the federal government. These guidelines apply to all components of an information system that process, store, or transmit federal information. The publication provides guidance to federal agencies implementing FIPS 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems."

What are the standards and guides used to create this preliminary self-assessment?

This questionnaire is derived from FIPS publication 200, "Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems." (9)  Can a service provider obtain the standards and guides?

NIST information security-related publications can be obtained free of charge from the NIST public Web site located at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/index.html. (10)  Where can I get assistance if I need help completing this assessment? If you have any questions concerning the completion of this form, please contact the OCC Information Risk Management Office at (202) 874-4480.

The following outline meets the minimum requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, as amended, and implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.7.  While this outline has been designed to be consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements, other formats of a subcontracting plan may be acceptable.  It is not intended to replace any existing corporate plan that is more extensive.  Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  “SUBCONTRACT,” as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employeremployee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract.  If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the Office of Small and Disadvantage Business Utilization (OSDBU) at (202) 690-7300 or the OPDIV Small Business Specialist at ___________________.  Sources may also be obtained from SBA’s PRONET website.  Please note that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has subcontracting goals of _____% for small business (SB), ____% for small disadvantaged business (SDB), _____% for HubZone businesses (HUBZone), ______% for women-owned business (WOSB), _____% for veteran-owned business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns for fiscal year _____.  For this procurement, HHS expects all proposed subcontracting plans to contain the following goals, at a minimum, _____% for small business, ____% small disadvantaged business, ____% for HubZone businesses, ______% for   woman owned businesses, and ______% for veteran-owned businesses.  These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total estimated subcontracting dollars. The offeror is required to include an explanation for a category that has zero as a goal.

In order to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the small, HubZone, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned and women-owned small business subcontracting goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with the contracting officer prior to approval of the plan.
