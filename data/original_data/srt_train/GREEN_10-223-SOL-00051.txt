SECTION 1.0: STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
Title:  Rational RequisitePro Annual Software license and Maintenance Support Renewal

1.0 Background

The Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) uses Rational RequisitePro to help project teams manage their requirements.  Requirements management is
an important step in the Enterprise Performance Life Cycle (EPLC) model used by FDA.   The Requirements Management Process encompasses tracking
of requirements status, base-lining requirements, managing changes to the requirements baseline and versions of requirements specifications, and
tracing individual requirements to work products.  Requirements management begins with the identification of high-level functional and non-
functional requirements in the System Boundary Document during the System Concept Development phase of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
 Identification, documentation, and management of requirements continue throughout the system’s life cycle.

Currently, the Rational Requisite Pro tool (version 6.1 and 7.0) and Software Document Automation (SoDA) are being used for managing, tracking,
and reporting on the status of requirements for the FDA projects. Rational RequisitePro was purchased with Twenty-Five (25) floating licenses.


2.0 Objective


The objective of the contract is to renew current licenses and provide support maintenance for Rational RequisitePro and SoDA, in order to
manage the complexity of project requirements of FDA software development systems.

52.227-15 Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software (Dec  2007)
(a) This solicitation sets forth the Government’s known delivery requirements for data (as defined in the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in Data--
General). Any resulting contract may also provide the Government the option to order additional data under the Additional Data Requirements
clause at 52.227-16, if included in the contract. Any data delivered under the resulting contract will be subject to the Rights in Data--General
clause at 52.227-14 included in this contract. Under the latter clause, a Contractor may withhold from delivery data that qualify as limited
rights data or restricted computer software, and deliver form, fit, and function data instead. The latter clause also may be used with its
Alternates II and/or III to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software, marked with limited rights or restricted
rights notices, as appropriate. In addition, use of Alternate V with this latter clause provides the Government the right to inspect such data
at the Contractor’s facility.
(b) By completing the remainder of this paragraph, the offeror represents that it has reviewed the requirements for the delivery of technical
data or computer software and states [offeror check appropriate block]—
[ ] (1) None of the data proposed for fulfilling the data delivery requirements qualifies as limited rights data or restricted computer
software; or
[ ] (2) Data proposed for fulfilling the data delivery requirements qualify as limited rights data or restricted computer software and are
identified as follows:
           _____________________________________________________
           ____________________________________________________
           ____________________________________________________
(c) Any identification of limited rights data or restricted computer software in the offeror's response is not determinative of the status of
the data should a contract be awarded to the offeror.
