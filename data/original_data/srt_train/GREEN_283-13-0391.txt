	Guide for Preparing Vouchers Under

	Cost-Reimbursement Type Contracts



I.	INTRODUCTION



A.	GENERAL

This Guide presents procedures for the preparation of Contractor's reimbursement claims under (1) cost-reimbursement type contracts; (2) the cost-reimbursement portions of fixed-price contracts; (3) letter contracts which provide for reimbursement of costs; (4) time and material contracts; and (5) labor-hour contracts.  The term "cost-reimbursement type contracts" as used in this Guide includes all of the foregoing contractual arrangements.



B.	DESK AUDIT

To expedite final payment on contracts subject to desk audit, the contractor may be required to provide the information set forth in III, C, of this guide.



C.	PRESCRIBED GOVERNMENT FORMS

Standard Form 1034 "Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal" (Figure 1), and Standard Form 1035, "Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal - Continuation Sheet" (Figure 2), should be utilized by Contractors to show the amount claimed for reimbursement under cost-reimbursement type contracts, and to provide the necessary supporting detail, respectively.  The SF 1035 may also be used to furnish any additional information as may be required by the Contracting Officer in accordance with the terms of the contract.  The voucher and continuation sheet may be on reproduced copies of the forms providing they conform to the official Government forms in format and are marked "original".



The Contractor may attach to the SF 1034, Public Vouchers for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal, Form HHS-646, Financial Report of Individual Project/Contract, or self-designed form may be used if it contains the information required by this Guide and is otherwise acceptable to the Contracting Officer.



D.	TIME OF SUBMISSION

Vouchers may be submitted at the beginning of each billing period for costs incurred during the preceding billing period.  Costs incurred earlier than the preceding billing period, but not previously billed for, may be included, but the amount and month(s)in which such costs were incurred must be stated in the SF 1035 or equivalent form.  Vouchers shall not be submitted more frequently than once each month unless such arrangements are made with the Contracting Officer.



E.	COST INCURRANCE PERIOD

Costs must be incurred within the contract performance period or the period covered by pre-contract cost provisions.



F.	CONTRACTOR'S FISCAL YEAR

Vouchers must be prepared in such a manner that costs claimed can be associated or identified with the Contractor's fiscal year.  This will ensure proper application of indirect cost rates to the direct costs of a particular fiscal year.



II.	PREPARATION OF PUBLIC VOUCHERS

Insert the latest: total estimated cost; total fee (if applicable); total contract value; and amount of fee payable (if applicable).

Insert:	"Summary of claimed current and cumulative cost" and "fee earned", if applicable.

Unless otherwise required by the contract, insert the major elements of incurred cost which are defined as follows:



(1)	Direct Costs

(a)	Direct Labor:   This consists of salaries and wages for direct performance of the contract.

(b)	Fringe Benefits:	This represents fringe benefits applicable to direct labor and billed as direct cost.  Fringe benefits included in indirect costs should not be identified here.

(c)	Capitalized Nonexpendable Equipment: This represents personal property of a capital nature; i.e., property acquired at a cost of $1000 or more and that has a service life of more than two years.

Form HHS 565, Report of Accountable Property as outlined in the HHS publication "Contractor's Guide for control of Government Property" will accompany the contractor's public voucher (SF 1034/SF 1035) as required.

(e)	Premium Pay:  This is remuneration in excess of the basic hourly rate.

(h)	Other:  List all other direct costs in total unless significant in amount.  If significant, list costs elements and dollar amount separately; i.e., subcontracts.





2.	Indirect Costs (as applicable)

(a) Fringe Benefit:  Cite the formula (rate and base) in effect during the time the costs were incurred and for which reimbursement is claimed.

(b) Overhead:  Cite the formula (rate and base) in effect during the time the costs were incurred and for which reimbursement is claimed.

(c) G&A:  Cite the formula (rate and base) in effect during the time the costs were incurred and for which reimbursement is claimed.

Insert the current costs claimed by major cost elements.  Costs claimed for reimbursement can be only those amounts that are consistent with the term "costs" as defined in allowable cost and payment clause.  Where it is found that amounts claimed do not meet this definition, such costs together with their associated costs and fee will be disallowed.  All adjustments included herein must be explained in detail.

Insert the cumulative costs claimed to date by major cost elements.

Costs claimed for cost-typed subcontracts must be supported by information similar to the SF 1035 for each subcontractor.  Costs for fixed-price subcontracts shall be on the basis of items delivered or services received, accepted and paid by the prime contractor.

Insert the total costs for the current and cumulative periods.

If the contract provides for an incentive or fixed-fee, insert the fee earned for the current and cumulative periods and the formula for such computation; e.g., if payment of the fee is based on a percentage of costs, the target incentive fee or fixed-fee earned shall be determined by applying the percentage ration of target incentive fee or fixed-fee to the total estimated cost of the contractor.  However after payment of 85% of the fee, the Contracting Officer may withhold further payment of fee to establish a reserve to protect the interests of the Government.  This reserve may not exceed 15% of the total fee, or $100,000, whichever is less. 

(15)	Each invoice should have a roll up page and detail information for each task.

	For Example



Contract Estimated Cost		$100,000

Fixed-Fee		    6,000

Total CPFF					$106,000



Maximum Fee Payable		$  5,100

(85% of 6,000)



Fixed-Fee					$  6,000 - 6% 

Estimated Cost					$100,000



Therefore, fixed-fee may be billed at 6% of actual costs incurred until the maximum fee of $5,100 has been paid.  Any fee withheld is payable upon submission of appropriate closing documents after final audit of the contract has been completed and all audit exceptions have been resolved. 



(15)	Insert the total costs claimed and the fee due for the current ad cumulative periods.

If applicable, resubmission of any previously claimed amounts which were suspended should be shown below the current amount claimed and footnoted to cite the number of the public voucher on which the deduction was made and the date and number of the related suspension notice.

Suspensions from which the contractor has successfully appealed shall be identified by referencing the Contracting Officer's letter of approval.

(17)	Insert the current amount claimed.  Transfer this amount to SF 1034.



III. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS



A.	Costs Requiring Prior Authorization and Approval

The contractor should be aware of the requirements for prior written approval from the Contracting Officer for certain costs (e.g., premium pay, foreign travel).  Whenever the voucher includes such costs not authorized by the contract, reference must be made to the Contracting Officer's Authorization letter (COA). 



B.	Withholding and Releases of Contract Reserves

Contractual provisions covering fees, patents, royalties, etc., usually provide for the accumulation of a withholding reserve until certain contract requirements are met to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.  It is the contractor's responsibility to include appropriate adjustments in his reimbursement claims to cover the required accumulation and release of contract withholding reserves.  The contractor should resolve any questions regarding the amount of these reserves with the Contracting Officer.



C.	Contractor's Completion Voucher	DUE WITHIN 12 months of EXPIRATION

After all costs have been assigned to the contract and all contract performance provisions have been completed, the Contractor shall promptly submit, but in any event within twelve (12) months from the date of such completion, its completion voucher to the office designated in the contract directly to the Contracting Officer to finalize the financial settlement of the contract).  This voucher must be specifically identified as the completion voucher and should include the remaining cost, fees, and reserves claimed to be due by the Contractor.  It will not include items and amounts which may be set out in any qualifications in the Contractor's release of claims.  A separate completion voucher shall be submitted for each individual project or task order for which a separate series of public vouchers has been submitted.



Final payment on prescribed contracts may be made on the basis of a desk audit.  To expedite final settlement on these contracts, the Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to submit detailed support for costs claimed under one or more interim vouchers.





D.	Contractor's Final Voucher and Closing Documents	DUE WITHIN 18 months of EXPIRATION

After completion of the final audit and all suspensions and/or audit exceptions have been resolved and there is mutual agreement between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer on the final allowable cost and fee, if any, the Contractor shall submit its final voucher and the appropriate closing documents to the office designated in the contract.  This voucher shall be specifically identified as the final voucher, and must be supported by the following documents:



(1)	Contractor's Release

(2)	Assignee's Release, if applicable.

(3)	Contractor's Assignment of Refunds, Rebates, Credits and Other Amounts

(4)	Assignee's Assignment of Refunds, Rebates, Credits, and Other Amounts, if applicable

(5)	Contractor's Affidavit or Waiver of Lien, when required by the contract



If final settlement of the contract is in the amount shown on the completion voucher, the Contractor need not submit a final voucher, but only the additional closing documents cited above.



The final voucher shall also include any final indirect rate variance adjustments from indirect rates being finalized.  This final voucher is due within 6 months after receipt of the Completion Voucher mentioned above.  If the indirect rates are not finalized at this time the contract will be closed out based on the provisional rates.



E.	Currency

All Department contracts are expressed in the  dollars.  Where expenditures are made in a currency other than  dollars, billings on the contract shall be expressed, and reimbursement by the United States Government shall be made, in that other currency at amounts coincident with the actual costs incurred.  Currency fluctuation may not be on a basis of gain or loss to the Contractor.  Notwithstanding the above, the total of all invoices paid under this contract may not exceed the  dollars authorized.



F.	Government Liaison

Any questions concerning delays in payment of Contractor's vouchers should be addressed to the office designated to receive the voucher; matters relative to performance or the instructions set forth in this Guide, should be addressed to the Contracting Officer.

	BREAKDOWN OF PROPOSED ESTIMATED COST (PLUS FEE) AND LABOR HOURS



	INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF THE FORMAT



1.	Refer to Business Proposal Instructions, Section L of this solicitation. The Instructions contain the requirements for proper submission of cost/price data which must be adhered to.



2.	This format has been prepared as a universal guideline for all solicitations issued by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. It may require amending to meet the specific requirements of this solicitation.  For example, this solicitation may require the submission of cost/price data for three years listed on this form.  (See Section L.1., General Information for the estimated duration of this project.)  If this solicitation is phased, identify each phase in addition to each year.  Total each year, phase, and sub-element.



3.	This format must be used to submit the breakdown of all proposed estimated cost elements. List each cost element and sub-element for direct costs, indirect costs and fee, if applicable. In addition, provide detailed calculations for all items. For example:



a.	For all personnel, list the name, title, rate per hour and number of hours proposed. If a pool of personnel is proposed, list the composition of the pool and how the cost proposed was calculated. List the factor used for prorating Year One and the escalation rate applied between years.



Offeror's proposal should be stated in the same terms as will be used to account for and record direct labor under a contract (i.e. percentage of effort is used for most faculty and professional employees at educational institutions).  If percentages of effort are used, the basis to which such percentages are applied must also be submitted by the offeror.  The attached format should be revised to accommodate direct labor proposed as a percentage of effort.



b.	For all materials, supplies, and other direct costs, list all unit prices, etc., to detail how the calculations were made.



c.	For all indirect costs, list the rates applied and the base the rate is applied to.



d.	For all travel, list the specifics for each trip.



e.	For any subcontract proposed, submit a separate breakdown format.



f.	Justification for the need of some cost elements may be listed as an attachment, i.e., special equipment, above average consultant fees, etc. 



4.	If the Government has provided "uniform pricing assumptions" for this solicitation, the offeror must comply with and identify each item.

  1. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may disclose information from this system of records to the Department of Justice, or to a court or other tribunal, when (a) HHS, or any component thereof; or (b) any HHS employee in his or her individual capacity where the Department of Justice (or HHS, where it is authorized to do so) has agreed to represent the employee; or (d) the United States or any agency thereof where HHS determines that the litigation is likely to affect HHS or any of its components, is a party to litigation or has an interest in such litigation, and HHS determines that the use of such records by the Department of Justice, the court or other tribunal is relevant and necessary to the litigation and would help in the effective representation of the governmental party, provided, however, that in each case, HHS determines that such disclosure is compatible with the purpose for which the records were collected.

  2. Disclosure may be made to a congressional office from the record of an individual in response to a verified inquiry from the congressional office made at the written request of that individual.

  3. SAMHSA proposes to contract with private firms for the purposes of handling logistics for conferences, reviews, development of training materials, and of obtaining the services of consultants.  Relevant records will be disclosed to such a contractor or may be developed by the contractor for use in the project.  The contractor shall be required to maintain Privacy Act safeguards with respect to such records.

  4. Information in this system of records is used routinely to prepare W-2 and 1099 Forms to submit to the Internal Revenue Service and applicable State and local governments those items to be included as income to an individual.



SAFEGUARDS:

  Measures to prevent unauthorized disclosures are implemented as appropriate for each location.  Each site implements personnel, physical and procedural safeguards such as the following:

  1. Authorized Users: Only SAMHSA personnel working on these projects and personnel employed by SAMHSA contractors to work on these projects are authorized users as designated by the system managers.

  2. Physical safeguards: Records are stored in locked rooms, locked file cabinets, and/or secured computer facilities.

  3. Procedural safeguards: Contractors who maintain records in this system are instructed to make no further disclosure of the records except as authorized by the system manager and permitted by the Privacy Act.  Privacy Act requirements are specifically included in contracts and in agreements with grantees or collaborators participating in research activities supported by this system.  HHS project directors, contract officers, and project officers oversee compliance with these requirements.

  4. Implementation guidelines: DHHS Chapter 45-13 and supplementary Chapter PHS.hf: 45-13 of the General Administration Manual, and Part 6, "Automated Information Systems Security" in the HHS Information Resources Management Manual.

B.1.  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES



The purpose of this task order is to provide communications support for national outreach and public education initiatives across a variety of behavioral health topics.  SAMHSA is working to improve the understanding and awareness of mental and substance use disorders, promote emotional health and the prevention of substance abuse and mental illness, increase access to effective treatment, and support recovery.  Guided by SAMHSA’s strategic plan, this task order will support public education initiatives which advance critical and timely elements of SAMHSA’s mission.  



One of the tasks for the base year is to continue a national underage drinking prevention campaign in concurrence with the direction of the United States Congress, in consultation with the industry, advocates, and other interested parties, for an underage drinking prevention public service campaign directed at parents.  The campaign targets educational efforts to parents of children aged 9 to 15.  It identifies and promulgates research-based public health messages and activities, and supports national and local media efforts to reduce underage drinking.  A workgroup including representatives of the private and public sectors, including representatives from the industry and advocacy organizations working in the prevention of underage drinking, advises the process and participates in a mutually acceptable, comprehensive public service campaign over the period of this task order.



The focus for the base year will be to continue to  promote, disseminate, and evaluate the public education messages developed by SAMHSA’s Underage Drinking Prevention National Media Campaign.  These campaign implementation efforts will utilize SAMHSA’s communication platforms and the network of intermediary partners as well as coordinate across SAMHSA’s related public education efforts.  This task order directly supports Goal 1.2 – Prevent or reduce consequences of underage drinking and adult problem drinking, SAMHSA’s Strategic Initiative #1 – Prevention of Substance Abuse and Mental Illness.  In the second and third years (Option Years 1 and 2), the focus will be to refresh the messages and products targeted to parents based on the lessons learned from each iteration of the  underage drinking media campaign.

If the Government exercises these options, notice must be given at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of this contract and the estimated cost of the contract will be increased as set forth in Section B.   



b.	52.217-9, OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MARCH 2000)



(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor for up to (Insert Number of Option Years at Time of Award) additional years, provided that the Government shall give the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires.

(b)If the Government exercises these options, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option provision. 



(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years.



52.217-8, OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the period specified in the Schedule.



H.2.  Performance Based Contract Plan



Introduction



This is a performance-based contract oriented toward outcomes and products.  As such, it gives the contractor the liberty to propose creative solutions and conceive new or alternative methods to achieve the Government’s objectives.   Management of the award fee and performance objectives are discussed in detail below.  As an additional incentive option years for the continuation of this contract will only be awarded with continued acceptable performance (Satisfactory or better).



b.	Award Fee Plan



The contractor will receive a small base fee and will be eligible for an award fee, which will be tied to the achievement of the performance objectives and targets specified. The award fee determinations are not subject to the Disputes Clause (FAR 52.233-1).  The Agency's decision to pay or not to pay Award Fee in no way alters the contractor's responsibilities to perform any functions or produce any deliverables required by the contract.  The Agency’s decision to pay or not to pay award fee in no way alters the Department's obligation to pay the contractor for satisfactory deliverables in accordance with the contract.   The distribution of the award fee, in whole or in part, will occur annually at the end of each contract year, based on the Government’s evaluation of whether the Contractor has met or exceeded the performance standards, in accordance with the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, at Attachment 2.  Award Fee is available for services and products identified below:

ANNUAL AMOUNTS AVAILABLE FOR AWARD FEE (to be evaluated and paid annually):

* 	Percentage of Award Fee that can be actually awarded at this score.



                                    



The Contracting Officer and the COR shall together determine whether a product/service is delivered on time and within budget.  If it is deemed to be on time and within budget, it will be evaluated for quality by an Award Fee Evaluation Group (Group).  Each Group will consist of the COR, the Contracting Officer or his/her designee, and approximately one other government officials or non-government personnel (depending on specific expertise) specified by the P.O. and approved by the Contracting Officer.  The composition of the Group may change from task to task.

 

Each member of the Group will evaluate the quality of the task using a numerical rating scale from 0 to 100.  The scale will be defined as follows:





Each member of the Group will give the product a numerical rating and those ratings will be averaged.  An Average of less than 60 (Unacceptable) will result in a reduction in the base fee of $1,000 for that twelve month rating period.  An average score between 61-69 (Satisfactory Performance) will result in Award of 0%, an average of 70-79 (Satisfactory Plus) will result in Award of 40%, an average of 80-89 (Excellent) will result in Award of 80%, and an average of 90 through 100 (Superior) will result in Award of 100%.



H.3.  PRIVACY ACT



This procurement action requires the Contractor to do one or more of the following: design, develop, or operate a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974 (5 USC 552a) and applicable agency regulations.  Violation of the Act may involve the imposition of criminal penalties.  The Contractor shall ensure that each Contractor employee knows the prescribed Rules of Conduct and each Contractor employee knows that he/she can be subject to criminal penalties for violation of the Privacy Act.



The Privacy Act System of Records applicable to this project are Systems Notice 09-30-0049.  This document is incorporated into this contract as an Attachment 11 in Section J.





The Privacy Act is applicable to the records kept by the Contractor on paying honorarium and/or per diem to Consultants.  The Contractor shall destroy these records in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act after contract closeout has occurred and the accounting record retention requirements of the Internal Revenue Service and the General Accounting Office have been met.



H.4     HHSAR 352.231-70 SALARY RATE LIMITATION (MAR 2012)

Pursuant to the current and applicable prior HHS appropriations acts, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the Federal Executive Schedule Level II in effect on the date an expense is incurred.

For purposes of the salary rate limitation, the terms ``direct salary,'' ``salary”, and ``institutional base salary'', have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as ``direct salary'', in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's direct effort (costs) under the contract.  Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor.  Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs).

Note:  The salary rate limitation does not restrict the salary that an organization may pay an individual working under an HHS contract or order; it merely limits the portion of that salary that may be paid with Federal funds.

The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals under subcontracts.  If this is a multiple-year contract or order, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract or order funding.

See the salaries and wages pay tables on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Web site for Federal Executive Schedule salary levels that apply to the current and prior periods.

SECTION L - INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS



1. GENERAL INFORMATION



INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION



 (a)	Definitions. As used in this provision-- 



"Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. 



"In writing", "writing", or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information.



"Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. 



"Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. 



"Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. 



(b)	Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). 



(c)	Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals. (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision. 



(2)	The first page of the proposal must show-- 

(i)	The solicitation number; 

(ii)	The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available); 

(iii)	A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item; 

(iv)	Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the offeror's behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and 

(v)	Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal. Proposals signed by an agent shall be accompanied by evidence of that agent's authority, unless that evidence has been previously furnished to the issuing office. 

(3)	Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.  (i) Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modifications or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation.  If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. 

	(ii)	(A)	Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-- 



	(1)	If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or 

	(2)	There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 

	(3)	It is the only proposal received. 



	(B)	However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. 



	(iii)	Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 

	(iv)	If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 

	(v)	Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award. 



(4)	Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items. 



(5)	Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.22517, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.



(6)	Offerors may submit modifications to their proposals at any time before the solicitation closing date and time, and may submit modifications in response to an amendment, or to correct a mistake at any time before award. 



(7)	Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer. 



(8)	Proposals may be withdrawn at any time before award. Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. 



(d)	Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). 



[Note:  In accordance with HHSAR 352.215-1, the following paragraph (e) is substituted for the subparagraph (e) of the provision at FAR 52.215-1.]



(e)	Restriction on disclosure and use of data. (1) The proposal submitted in response to this request 

	may contain data (trade secrets; business data, e.g., commercial information, financial information, 

	and cost and pricing data; and technical data) which the offeror, including its prospective 

	subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the 

	proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government 

	determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 

	U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the 	

	following legend, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be restricted in

	 accordance with the conditions of the legend. The Government's determination to withhold or

	 disclose a record will be based upon the particular circumstances involving the record in question

	 and whether the record may be exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. 

	The legend reads:



Unless disclosure is required by the freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services, data contained in the portions of this proposal which have been specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. by the offeror as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes.



The offeror acknowledges that the Department may not be able to withhold a record (data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the Department's FOI officials must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if the Department has determined that disclosure is required by the Act.



If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act.



The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act. The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages (insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other identification).



(2)	In addition, the offeror should mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the

	 following statement:



“Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation.”



(3)	Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive legends or statements

	 differing in substance from the above legend may not be considered for award. The

	 Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with a nonconforming

	 legend.



(f)	Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this

	 solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after

	 evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. 



(2)	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's

	 interest. 



(3)	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. 



(4)	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions

	 with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the 

	offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and 

	technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the 

	Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer .

	determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range

	 exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting

	 Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number 

	that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. 



(5)	The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than

	 the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies 

	otherwise in the proposal. 



(6)	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or

	 counteroffer by the Government. 



		(7)	The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. 



(8)	If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source

	 selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. 



(9)	A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful

2.        INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS



A.	GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS



Introduction



The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and contents of proposals.  The Government requires a minimum acceptance period of 120 days.  Special attention is directed to the requirements for technical and business proposals to be submitted in accordance with these instructions. 



a.		General Clauses/Provisions:  In addition to the special clauses/provisions of this RFP, any resultant contract shall include the general clauses/provisions applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded.  Any additional clauses required by Public Law, Executive Order, or procurement regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.



b.	Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal:  The proposal shall be signed by an official authorized to bind your organization.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the address, and marked as indicated in Attachment 4, entitled, PACKAGING AND DELIVERY OF PROPOSAL, Part III, Section J hereof.  Proposals must be typewritten, paginated, reproduced on letter size paper, and must be legible in all required copies.  To expedite the proposal evaluation, all documents required for responding to the RFP should be separated in the following order:

c.  	Separation of Technical and Business Proposals:  The proposal shall be prepared in two (2) parts:

 		a Technical Proposal and a Business Proposal.  Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in 

		itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, 

		evaluation of the other.  The Technical Proposal should not contain any references to cost; 

		however, resources information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, 

		subcontracts, travel, etc., should be contained in the Technical Proposal so that the offeror's 

		understanding of the Statement of Work can be evaluated.  The Technical Proposal must 

		describe the technical approach in sufficient detail to provide a clear and concise presentation that 

		addresses, but is not limited to, the requirements of the Technical Proposal Instructions.

	

d.	Evaluation of Proposals:  The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with the evaluation factors set forth in Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award.



e.	Potential Award Without Discussions



		The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting    

             	Officer determines that the initial prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not 

		necessary.



f	.	Privacy Act:  The Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information, the authority which authorized the solicitation, whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used, the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information, and the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.



The Government is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Sec. 30l (g) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and Public Law 92-218, as amended.



Provisions of the information requested are entirely voluntary.  The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.



Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.



In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Sec. 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals are requested to disclose their social security number:



Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and efficient identification, referral, review and management of SAMHSA Contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is provided by Section 305 and Title IV of the PHS Act, as amended.



The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:



To the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange for dissemination of science information.

To the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Officer for auditing.

To the Department of Justice as required for litigation.

To respond to congressional inquiries.

To qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees for opinions as a part of the review process.



	g.       Selection of Offeror



1.  The acceptability of the technical portion of your contract proposal will be evaluated by a technical review committee.  The committee will evaluate your proposal in strict conformity with the evaluation criteria of the RFP, utilizing point scores and written critiques.  The committee may suggest that the Contracting Officer request clarifying information from an offeror.



2.  The business portion of your contract proposal will be subjected to a cost, cost realism and price analysis.  Proposed costs which are found to be unrealistic may be adjusted, in order to allow better evaluation of the total price of the offer.



3.  If award will be made without conducting discussions, you may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of your proposal or to resolve minor or clerical errors.



4.  The Government reserves the right to make a single award or no award at all to the RFP.  In addition, the RFP may be amended or canceled as necessary to meet government’s requirements. 



Salary Rate Limitation Legislation (MAR 2012)

Pursuant to the current and applicable prior HHS appropriations acts, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the Federal Executive Schedule Level II in effect on the date an expense is incurred.

For purposes of the salary rate limitation, the terms ``direct salary,'' ``salary”, and ``institutional base salary'', have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as ``direct salary'', in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's direct effort (costs) under the contract.  Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor.  Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs).

Note:  The salary rate limitation does not restrict the salary that an organization may pay an individual working under an HHS contract or order; it merely limits the portion of that salary that may be paid with Federal funds.

The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals under subcontracts.  If this is a multiple-year contract or order, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract or order funding.

See the salaries and wages pay tables on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Web site for Federal Executive Schedule salary levels that apply to the current and prior periods.

If these are not represented in the offeror's current operations, they should normally be supported by commitment or explicit arrangement, which is in existence at the time the contract is to be awarded, for the rental, purchase, or other acquisition of such resources, equipment, facilities, or personnel.  In addition, the offeror shall indicate his/her ability to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule taking into consideration all existing business commitments, commercial as well as Government.







10.  	Proposals from Subcontrctors or Other Collaborative Partners:



The organization identified as the Offeror in a proposal is the Prime Offeror that is responsible for all aspects of the proposal submitted and any contract awarded as a result of that proposal.  This is true regardless of any contractual arrangement between the Prime Offeror and any proposed subcontractor, or any proposed partner in a Joint Venture or other collaborative arrangement between two or more organizations. Consequently, the Prime Offeror must include in its proposal, all technical and business information pertaining to any subcontract or collaborative arrangement. Separate submission of proposals by subcontractors or collaborative partners is not permitted, and proposals submitted in that manner will not be accepted or further considered by the Government.



	11.	SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE:  



Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires agencies and their contractors to utilize Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) that is accessible to people with disabilities.



On June 25, 2001, accessibility requirements for Federal Electronic and Information Technology took effect under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  This law requires that such technology be accessible according to standards developed by the Access Board, which are now part of the Federal government's procurement regulations (Ref. to the Section 508 Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Final Rule published on April, 2001 in the Federal Register). 



These standards, as issued by the Board, cover a variety of products, including computer hardware and software, web sites, phone systems, fax machines, copiers, and similar technologies.  Provisions in the standards spell out what makes these products accessible to people with disabilities, including those with vision, hearing, and mobility impairments.  The Board included both technical criteria specific to various types of technologies and performance-based requirements, which focus on a product's functional capabilities.  



The law relies strongly on the procurement process to ensure compliance with the new standards.  Compliance with the standards is required, except where it would pose an "undue burden" (as defined in the standards) or where no complying product is commercially available.



Offerors must propose goods and/or services that meet the applicable provisions of the Access Board’s standards as identified by the agency.  Alternatively, offerors may propose goods or services that provide equivalent facilitation.  Such offers will be considered to have met the provisions of the Access Board’s standards for the feature or component providing equivalent facilitation.



	12.	Past Performance



Offerors must submit the following information as part of their Business Proposal.



Past performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which Offerors’ relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the Government.  Experience and past performance are factors which are relevant to the ability of the Offeror to perform and are considered in the source selection process.  Offerors must submit the information in a., below, for both the Offeror and all proposed major subcontractors.



	a.	A list of the last five (5) contracts and subcontracts completed during the past THREE (3) years and ALL CONTRACTS currently in process that are similar in nature to the solicitation work scope.  Contracts listed may include those entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments, and commercial concerns.  Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for all proposed key personnel.



		Include the following information for each contract or subcontract:

		

Name of Contracting Organization

Contract Number (for subcontracts, provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number)

Contract Type

Total Contract Value

Description of Requirement

Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number

Program Manager's Name and Telephone Number

NAICS Code



	b.  	By no later than the date proposals are due under this solicitation, Offerors should 

		complete and send Attachment 12 (Example Client Letter)  to each reference 

		identified above.   Offerors should include a copy of Attachment 13 (Contractor 

		Performance Information form) for the client to complete and send to 	SAMHSA, as specified in the client letter.  Offerors should ask each reference to 

		return the completed form to the SAMHSA Contracting Office, as prescribed on the 

		form.  Completed forms from references are due ten (10) calendar days after the 

		date proposals are due under this solicitation.  Offerors should request that the 

		reference please return the completed form to the SAMHSA Contract Specialist/ 

		Contracting Officer by this date.  Do not ask the reference to give you a copy of the 

		completed form or any information therein.  If additional information is determined 

		to be necessary, the Contracting Officer will contact the reference.



	c.	Subcontracts - The Offeror should also submit comparable information on all subcontractors that the Offeror proposes to perform a major subcontract under this effort.  For the purpose of this solicitation, a "major subcontract" is defined as a subcontract in excess of $550,000.  Past performance of any major subcontract will be weighted by the dollars share of that subcontractor to the entire contract value.  The total points for past performance will be apportioned among prime and subcontractors as determined by the dollar share of the organization to the dollars amount of the entire proposal amount, and will be scored based on past performance information.



The Offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the Offeror's corrective actions.



		 d.  	  By past performance, the Government means the Offeror's record of conforming to 

			  specifications and to the highest standards of excellence; adherence to contract schedules, 

			  including the administrative aspects of performance; history of reasonable and   

                          cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and business-like concern                               

                          for the interests of those entities with which it interacts.  



	e.	Each Offeror will be evaluated on its performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the acquisition under consideration.  



		  f.   	The Government reserves the right to evaluate relevant past performance information not 

			specifically provided by the Offeror.




SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD



M.1.	General



A.	Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on an evaluation of proposals against two factors.  The factors are as follows:  technical and cost.  Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the contract, cost/price is also important to the overall contract award decision.  In any case, the Government reserves the right to make an award(s) to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.



The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractor in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFP.  The merits of the proposal will be evaluated carefully. The proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFP.  The Offeror must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposal based on the detailed criteria listed below.  



B.	All proposals will be reviewed in accordance with the governing regulations and SAMHSA policies and procedures.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the likelihood of meeting the Government's requirements.  The evaluation will be based on the technical and administrative capabilities in relation to the needs of the program and each task and the reasonableness of costs shown in relation to the work to be performed.  The evaluation factors in Section M.2. are those that will be applied in the evaluation of each technical proposal including the assigned weight given to each factor (as applicable). 



C.  	Past Performance will be evaluated by SAMHSA staff using information gathered from the Offeror's current/previous clients (see Section L.C.12).  If an Offeror, or the proposed employees for the Offeror, does/do not have a past performance history relating to this solicitation, the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on this factor.



M.2    TECHNICAL, SDB PARTICIPATION, SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE, AND PAST 

	     PERFORMANCE EVALUATION		



The following Evaluation Factors 1. through 4., for a total of 100 points, will be evaluated by an Ad Hoc Technical Review Committee, who will also recommend technical acceptability or unacceptability of the proposal.  



Evaluation Factor 5., Section 508 Compliance (Pass/Fail); and Evaluation Factor 6, Past Performance (Pass/Fail), will be evaluated by SAMHSA/DCM staff.  These two (2) factors will be evaluated after establishment of the competitive range.  Proposals in the competitive range that receive a “Fail” score for the Section 508 Compliance factor will be removed from further award consideration.



The assigned weight for each evaluation factor is indicated.  If there is no stipulation as to the specific weights for a given subfactor/subpart under a criterion, then each subfactor/subpart is considered equally weighted.

M3.	 Evaluation of Options (JUL l990) (FAR 52.217-5)



Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government’s best interest, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the options.



M4. Cost Evaluation



Proposals will be evaluated for the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost.  The Government may adjust the proposed cost for evaluation purposes based upon an assessment of the proposal’s overall cost realism.  Cost realism analyzes whether the costs in an Offeror’s proposal are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the Offeror’s technical proposal.



M5.  Basis for award



Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal represents the greatest overall value to the Government																						, from both a technical and cost standpoint.  The technical factor is more important than the cost factor.

Project Title: National Outreach, Public Education and Engagement Initiatives (NOPEEI)  



A.	Background Information



The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) was created in 1992 to work in collaboration with States to improve prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services for individuals with mental and/or substance use disorders. Its vision is to provide leadership and devote its resources toward helping the Nation act on the knowledge that: behavioral health is essential for health, prevention works, treatment is effective and people recover from mental and substance use disorders.  Toward that end, SAMHSA has identified Public Awareness and Support as one of the lead strategic initiative efforts with an emphasis on increasing the public understanding about mental and substance use disorders and the numerous issues associated with increasing public acceptance and furthering self determination and support for those in recovery from these conditions.  This will be the umbrella for setting the strategic direction for SAMHSA’s communications work through 2014 to help people with mental and/or substance use disorders and their families build strong and supportive communities, prevent costly behavioral health problems, be resilient after traumatic experiences and promote better health for all Americans.



Individuals with mental and/or substance use disorders experience high rates of trauma, unemployment, homelessness, poverty, social isolation, discrimination, poor health outcomes, and early mortality. Despite promising new approaches, little improvement has taken place and these individuals remain continually marginalized and excluded from their communities. Additionally, prejudice and discrimination have been identified as major impediments to social inclusion.



Public education and outreach to SAMHSA’s mission-oriented constituencies has been a cornerstone of SAMHSA’s efforts to prevent and reduce the incidence of mental and substance use disorders and the trauma associated with these disorders.  Moreover, SAMHSA’s legislative Authority (SEC. 501. 290aa. SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION) and subsequent Congressional mandates (Section 2(d) of the 2006 Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act (STOP Act)) call for SAMHSA to carry out public information and knowledge dissemination functions on these issues.  



Within this context, SAMHSA seeks to engage key constituencies  to conduct efforts that will help to  promote increased public awareness and understanding of the multitude of issues that currently hinder the advancement of wellness as well as those that can promote the wellbeing of those affected by mental and/or substance use disorders. Through these efforts, SAMHSA will engage the public in a broad dialogue about how to prevent, treat, and broaden public and familial connectedness and support for those affected by mental and/or substance use disorders so we can continue to reduce the incidence of mental illnesses and addictions and generate the necessary support to get people into treatment as well as to sustain those in recovery from these conditions.



The purpose of this task order is to provide communications support for national outreach and public education initiatives across a variety of behavioral health topics.  SAMHSA is working to improve the understanding and awareness of mental and substance use disorders, promote emotional health and the prevention of substance abuse and mental illness, increase access to effective treatment, and support recovery.  Guided by SAMHSA’s strategic plan, this task order will support public education initiatives which advance critical and timely elements of SAMHSA’s mission.  



One of the tasks for the base year is to continue a national underage drinking prevention campaign in concurrence with the direction of the United States Congress, in consultation with the industry, advocates, and other interested parties, for an underage drinking prevention public service campaign directed at parents.  The campaign targets educational efforts to parents of children aged 9 to 15.  It identifies and promulgates research-based public health messages and activities, and supports national and local media efforts to reduce underage drinking.  A workgroup including representatives of the private and public sectors, including representatives from the industry and advocacy organizations working in the prevention of underage drinking, advises the process and participates in a mutually acceptable, comprehensive public service campaign over the period of this task order.



The focus for the base year will be to continue to  promote, disseminate, and evaluate the public education messages developed by SAMHSA’s Underage Drinking Prevention National Media Campaign.  These campaign implementation efforts will utilize SAMHSA’s communication platforms and the network of intermediary partners as well as coordinate across SAMHSA’s related public education efforts.  This task order directly supports Goal 1.2 – Prevent or reduce consequences of underage drinking and adult problem drinking, SAMHSA’s Strategic Initiative #1 – Prevention of Substance Abuse and Mental Illness.  In the second and third years (Option Years 1 and 2), the focus will be to refresh the messages and products targeted to parents based on the lessons learned from each iteration of the  underage drinking media campaign.

 

Youth who begin drinking before the age of 15 are seven times more likely to develop alcohol problems as compared to those who wait until 21.  Each additional year of delayed drinking onset reduces the probability of alcohol dependence by 14 percent. Students diagnosed with alcohol abuse were found to be four times more likely to experience major depression than those without an alcohol problem (NIAAA, 1997).  Alcohol use is linked with youthful death by drowning, fire, suicide, and homicide.  In particular, alcohol use among youth has been associated with considering, planning, attempting, and completing suicide (NIAAA, 1997 and 2000).  SAMHSA recognizes addressing underage drinking is a priority goal in the improvement of prevention services and the reduction of future substance abuse.    



B.	Objectives



Historically and currently, SAMHSA has conducted a number of key initiatives that have addressed both Congressional and SAMHSA priorities. These include the Sober Truth on Preventing (STOP) Underage Drinking Act, National Recovery Month, National Prevention Week, Suicide Prevention, National Dialogue, National Insurance Enrollment, Children’s Mental Health, Wellness, and ADS Center (SAMHSA’s Resource Center to Promote Acceptance, Dignity and Social Inclusion Associated with Mental Health).  Each one of these efforts reach specific target audiences and collectively contribute to the overall improvement of behavioral health services and access to care, and, to a positive shift in public attitudes about those in need of these services as well as those in recovery. Moreover, many of these efforts address the critical need of dissemination of preventive messages to safeguard the wellbeing of our children and youth.



For the base year, the goal of the Underage Drinking Prevention National Media Campaign directed at parents is to delay the onset of underage drinking and reduce underage drinking by increasing communication between parents and youth concerning alcohol issues and by encouraging parents to get others involved in the effort to prevent underage drinking.  The Underage Drinking Prevention National Media Campaign is designed to improve parents’ awareness, understanding, and behavior around the importance of communication concerning the harms associated with underage drinking.  The campaign targets parents in all parts of the nation and will include ethnically and racially diverse populations and rural populations.

6. SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE: 

 

A—Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, requires agencies and their Contractors to buy Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) that is accessible to people with disabilities.

 

B—On June 25, 2001, accessibility requirements for Federal Electronic and Information Technology took effect under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. This law requires that such technology be accessible according to standards developed by the Access Board, which are now part of the Federal government's procurement regulations (Ref. to the Section 508 Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Final Rule published on April, 2001 in the Federal Register).

 

C—These standards, as issued by the Board, cover a variety of products, including computer hardware and software, websites, phone systems, fax machines, copiers, and similar technologies. Provisions in the standards spell out what makes these products accessible to people with disabilities, including those with vision, hearing, and mobility impairments. The Board included both technical criteria specific to various types of technologies and performance-based requirements, which focus on a product's functional capabilities.

 

D—The law relies strongly on the procurement process to ensure compliance with the new standards. Compliance with the standards is required except where it would pose an "undue burden" (as defined in the standards) or where no complying product is commercially available.



E—To be considered eligible for award, offerors must propose goods and/or services that meet the applicable provisions of the Access Board's standards as identified by the agency. Alternatively, offerors may propose goods or services that provide equivalent facilitation.  Such offers will be considered to have met the provisions of the Access Board's standards for the feature or component providing equivalent facilitation.

 

F—In instances in which deliverables and other artifacts generated by the contractor are intended for distribution via the Internet, deliverables must comply with Section 508 requirements.  Additional online resources, including the Section 508 compliance standards are available for reference ().

Target Audiences - specific target audiences that need to be reached to achieve these objectives 

Program, Product or Service - what will be delivered to these target audiences in order to reach the identified objectives 

Formatting - how messages about these deliverables will be formatted to reach the identified objectives 

Creative Mix of Tactics and Message Products - Advertising, Promotion, Events, Public Relations and Personal Communications approaches that will be combined with electronic or print message products to help achieve the identified objectives, timed against a projected product life expectancy.

Dissemination - implementation of this creative mix to reach identified objectives  

Evaluation and Quality Improvement - data gathering needed to improve task performance, and justify public investment in activities supporting SAMHSA’s mission  



Use of the template is a requirement for creation, promotion, dissemination and evaluation of communications products developed through this task order.
