STATEMENT OF WORK
CLOUD HOSTING SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR THE INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES I. BACKGROUND

The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) currently hosts an array of websites that support its data collection and dissemination activities in its own dedicated server facility. To reduce costs, improve efficiency, and allow for growth and innovation, IES has identified Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or cloud hosting as the best option to replace its physical datacenter. IaaS hosting model enables convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable and reliable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal user effort or service provider interaction. Additional server, storage, and bandwidth resources can be added almost immediately as demand increases and as applications grow in complexity and size. Managing IaaS can be done by IES staff using a web interface or programmatically using an application programming interface (API), allowing us to scale up or down resources as necessary. Instead of paying for individual servers on a purchase or lease basis, IES will pay for abstract metered computer resources such as central processing using (CPU) cycles, memory, storage, with an ability to increase or decrease our usage as needed with the associated fees adjusting accordingly. The IaaS service sought by IES would host and serve most or all of the public-facing websites and systems currently housed in IES' physical data center. The proposed IaaS service should be able to be certified and accredited to Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements with a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 categorization of Moderate and comply with the security standards detailed in the FIPS 140-2.

II.

The contractor shall maintain the confidentiality of all documents, data, and other information supplied by IES/ED or acquired in the course of performance of this contract, except for any documents or other information specifically designated as non-confidential by IES/ED. The contractor shall take such measures as are necessary to maintain the required security and protection of confidential information (see section Data Security Plan). Compliance with ED IT Security Policy The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall comply with ED's IT security policy requirements, specifically those set forth in the `Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy (OCIO -01)', and other applicable procedures and guidance. The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall develop and implement management, operational and technical security controls to assure required levels of protection for information systems. The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall further comply with all applicable Federal IT security requirements including, but not limited to, the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Process (FedRAMP). These security requirements include, but are not limited to, the successful Certification and Accreditation (C&A) or Security Authorization (SA) of the system (includes commercially owned and operated systems managed by the commercial vendor and its sub-contractors, supporting Department programs, contracts, and projects); obtaining a full Authority to Operate (ATO) before being granted operational status; performance of annual self-assessments of security controls; annual Contingency Plan testing; performance of periodic vulnerability scans; updating all information system security documentation as changes occur; and other continuous monitoring activities, which may include, mapping, penetration and other intrusive scanning. Full and unfettered access for ED's third party Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP) must be granted to access all computers and networks used for this system. 8

Additionally, when there is a significant change to the system's security posture, the system (Federal and commercial prime- and sub- contractors included) must have a new C&A or SA, with all required activities to obtain a new ATO, signed by the Authorizing Official (AO). System security controls shall be designed and implemented consistent with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-53 Rev 3, `Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations.' All NIST SP 800-53 controls must be tested / assessed no less than every 3 years, according to federal and Department policy. The risk impact level of the system will be determined via the completion of ED's inventory form and shall meet the accurate depiction of security categorization as outlined in Federal Information Publishing Standards (FIPS) 199, `Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.' System security documentation shall be developed to record and support the implementation of the security controls for the system. This documentation shall be maintained for the life of the system. The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall review and update the system security documentation at least annually and after significant changes to the system, to ensure the relevance and accurate depiction of the implemented system controls and to reflect changes to the system and its environment of operation. Security documentation must be developed in accordance with the NIST 800 series and Department of Education policy and guidance. The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall allow ED employees (or Department designated third party contractors) access to the hosting facility to conduct C&A/SA activities to include control reviews in accordance with NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 3 and NIST SP 800-53A. The contractor, and all sub-contractors, shall be available for interviews and demonstrations of security control compliance to support the C&A/SA process and continuous monitoring of system security. In addition, if the system is rated as `Moderate' or `High' for FIPS 199 risk impact, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing shall be performed on the hosting facility and application as part of the C&A/SA process. Appropriate access agreements will be reviewed and signed before any scanning or testing occurs. Identified deficiencies between required NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 3 controls and the contractor's, and all sub-contractor's implementation, as documented in the Risk Assessment Report, System Security Plan (SSP) and Security Assessment Report (SAR), shall be tracked for mitigation through the development of a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) in accordance with the `Handbook for Information Assurance Security Policy (OCIO-01).' Depending on the severity of the deficiencies, ED may require remediation before an ATO is issued. All awarded contracts shall ensure that: 1. Their IT product/system is monitored during all hours of operations using entrusted detective/preventive systems; 2. Their IT product/system has current antiviral products installed and operational; 3. Their IT product/system is scanned on a reoccurring basis; 4. Vulnerabilities are remediated in a timely manner on their IT product/system; and

9

5. Access/view for cyber security situational awareness on their IT product/system is made available to ED CIRC (cyber incident response capability). Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) For IPv6, the contractor shall provide commercially available, off-the-shelf solutions that are IPv6 capable. An IPv6 capable system or product shall be capable of receiving, processing, transmitting and forwarding IPv6 packets and/or interfacing with other systems and protocols in a manner similar to that of IPv4. Specific criteria to be deemed IPv6 capable are:    An IPv6 capable system that meets the IPv6 base requirements defined by the USGv6 Profile and Testing program as found here (http://www.antd.nist.gov/usgv6/profile.html). Systems being developed, procured or acquired shall maintain interoperability with IPv4 systems/capabilities. Systems shall implement IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack and shall also be built to determine which protocol layer to use depending on the destination host it is attempting to communicate with or establish a socket with. If either protocol is possible, systems shall employ IPv6.

The contractor shall provide IPv6 technical support for system development, implementation and management. System Development Standards Information systems shall be developed in accordance with the ED Lifecycle Management Framework (LCM), ACS-OCIO 1-106. Reporting of Data Security Breaches If there is a suspected or known breach/disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) due to lost, theft, intercepted transfer, or other, the contractor must ensure that this breach is reported to the agency as soon as the contractor has knowledge of it. Per Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-0619, Federal agencies have a requirement to report breaches of PII security to a Federal incident response center. IES must notify ED within 30 minutes of discovering the incident (and the agency should not distinguish between suspected or confirmed breaches). The data security plan must be written to reflect this requirement, and the contractor must provide sufficient notification and documentation of the suspected loss, as it is understood at the time of notification to the agency for this requirement to be met. Follow-up reports of the final status of loss events will also be prepared by the contractor within a reasonable period of time as advised by the IES COR. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requests If the contractor receives a FOIA request for any data under this contract, then the contractor will immediately refer this request to the COR. IES will process all FOIA requests related to this contract. Implementation of Data Security Plan The contractor shall conform to the agreed-upon approved data security plan, in all activities, and shall 10

strictly enforce all procedures for ensuring confidentiality. These procedures will apply to all phases of the project, including (but not limited to): 1) Data collection in the field; 2) The transfer or transport of PII in any format, including paper records and electronic data files; 3) Safeguarding and storage of master data files and response/collection documents and electronic files. Affidavit of Nondisclosure Any contractor employee with access to confidential information including IT systems used for receiving, storing, transmitting, and accessing confidential information (i.e., personally identifiable information) under this contract shall first sign an Affidavit of Nondisclosure. Before any contractor employee starts work on the contract and has access to confidential information, a signed Affidavit of Nondisclosure must be completed. As new staff start and require access to confidential information or as staff who originally did not require such access subsequently need it, an Affidavit of Nondisclosure shall be executed by them on the first working day of the assignment. The contractor shall indicate the position in the organization of the person signing the Affidavit of Nondisclosure, and the person's functional relationship to this project in a memorandum provided to the COR. The contractor shall execute these Affidavits of Nondisclosure, submit the signed Affidavits to the COR, and the contractor shall maintain the copies at its office. The contractor shall make Acrobat pdf copies of new Affidavits as they are completed. Throughout the life of the contract Affidavits of Nondisclosure for new project staff, including any short-term personnel, will be submitted to the COR on a flow basis. The contractor shall be able to produce the original hard copies of the Affidavits within a few hours notice from the COR. Security and Confidentiality Training During the course of work on the tasks in this contract, contractor employees will be supporting IaaS used for receiving, storing, transmitting, and accessing data that are confidential. Given the restrictions on the use and handling of confidential information, all contractor employees with access to confidential information related to this contract shall be required to participate in IES approved security and confidentiality training. Contractor Employee Security Screening Requirements ED has established policy on personnel security screening for all contractor and subcontractor employees and their field staff. The relevant Departmental Directive is OM:5-101. It was last updated in July 2010 and can be found at: http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/leg/foia/acsom5101.pdf . The contractor must comply with the personnel security-screening requirements in OM:5-101 throughout the life of the contract. All contractor and subcontractor employees must undergo personnel security screening if they will be employed for thirty (30) days or more.

11

The type of screening and the timing of the screening will depend upon the nature of the contractor position, the type of data the contractor employee will have access to, or the type of ED IT system they will access. Personnel security screenings will be commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm the individual could cause to ED or the public. A position risk level will be assigned to each contractor employee position, before a solicitation is released, consistent with the descriptions in Appendix I of OM:5-101. Hence, each contractor employee working on this contract must be assigned a position risk level. Depending on the risk level assigned to each person's position, a follow-up background investigation by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may occur.

The contractor must identify one of their employees as a security liaison for this process. This Contractor Security Liaison coordinates the distribution, collection, and dissemination of various forms required in this process. They answer general questions from their employees on completing the security screening process. And, they are the first point of contact for contractor employees in using the OPM's internet based security screening portal called the Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) ( http://www.opm.gov/e-qip/ ). The contractor is also responsible for ensuring that all subcontractors follow these personnel security screening procedures.
IES requires each contractor employee to have or apply for a clearance for the security level designated for the position held on a contract. Contractor employees who have undergone appropriate personnel security screening for another Federal agency will be required to submit proof of that personnel security screening for validation. For these employees, the contractor or subcontractor must follow these required steps:

1. The contractor must send the COR a letter on Company letterhead that lists the full name of each
employee with a pre-existing clearance, the agency that cleared the employee, the level of the clearance, and the date of the clearance. This letter must be transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of starting work on an IES contract.

2. In those cases where any of the required information on level of clearance, agency that cleared the
employee and date of clearance is not available, the contractor must send the COR a letter on Company letterhead that lists the full name and Social Security Number for each employee with a pre-existing clearance. This letter must be transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of starting work on an IES contract.

3. The COR will transmit the letter to the IES Security Representative for processing. 4.
The IES Security Representative reviews the letter to ensure that the required information is provided and either returns it to the contractor for completion or releases it to ED's Chief of Personnel Security. The contractor must resubmit the letter to the COR within 7 business days or the contractor employee must be removed from the contract. clearance was identified and ruled to be acceptable by ED's Chief of Personnel Security.

5. The IES Security Representative will notify the contractor or subcontractor if the pre-existing

12

6. Those employees whose pre-existing clearances are not verified and approved must follow the
process outlined next to apply for a security clearance. For contractor employees who have not undergone appropriate personnel security screening for another Federal agency, all contractors must comply with the Principal Office (PO) Executive Office or Computer Security Officer's pre-processing requirements for personnel security screening and granting access privileges. No contractor employees are permitted unsupervised access to unclassified sensitive information (i.e., personally identifiable information), direct access to respondents who are minors, or Department of Education IT systems until they have submitted applicable security screening documents. For each contractor employee in a high risk level position the completed security screening documents must be accepted by the COR and the IES Security Representative and submitted to ED's Chief of Personnel Security within 14 days of the date the contractor employee starts working on the contract. In order to meet this Departmental requirement, steps 1 through 7 must be completed within 14 days of the date the contractor employee starts working on the contract. To meet this 14 day deadline and the interim deadlines specified below, it is strongly recommended that the contractor request the account initiation three (3) weeks before the contractor employee starts contract work and encourage each contractor employee to complete all required security screening forms before starting contract work. Contractor employees in High Risk IT (6C) Level positions require preliminary personnel security screenings before they are given access to unclassified sensitive information or Department of Education IT systems. The security screening of contractor and subcontractor employees not holding ED recognized security screening credentials must follow these required steps: 1. The contractor must provide the COR with an electronic listing of all employees on a specific contract, with the risk level associated with the position held by each employee as specified in the contract solicitation. The COR will review the electronic listing for completeness and approve. The listing will not be approved if it is found to be incomplete. 2. ED's participates in the OPM e-QIP system to facilitate the security screening process for contractor employees. IES will initiate an e-QIP account for each contractor employee. It is advisable to request the account initiation three (3) weeks before the contractor employee starts contract work. For the initiation of these accounts, the Contractor Security Liaison must use the CORapproved list of employees and the risk levels assigned to the employees' positions to produce and submit the following list using the attached template: a. For each contractor employee provide: Social Security Number, Full Name, Date of Birth, Place of Birth, risk level, e-Mail Address, and phone number. The Contractor Security Liaison must place the spreadsheet in a password protected file, then upload the list to the IES secure server, and send an e-mail notification of the transmission to the IES Security Representative. The IES security staff will use this list to establish the contactor employee e-QIP accounts. The COR will work with the contractor to establish access to the IES secure server at the outset of the contract.

13

b. Once IES sets up the e-QIP accounts for contract employees, the IES Security Representative will send an email to the Contractor Security Liaison stating that the employee has an active account on the e-QIP system. The COR is copied on this email notification. c. The Contractor Security Liaison must notify their employees of this active account. A computer with Internet access and web browsing software is required for the contractor employee to access their E-QIP account. Each employee must log into their personal account in e-QIP, enter the requested information, finish the application process and print, sign, and date the e-QIP signature pages. 3. Each contractor employee must submit a completed set of security screening forms to their Contractor Security Liaison as provided by the IES Security Representative, including for example:

a. The signed and dated e-QIP signature pages, b. The Declaration of Federal Employment (OPM form OF-306), c.
The Fair Credit Release Form,

d. The Request for Security Officer Action (RSA) Form,
1) The contractor employee shall complete only those items in section 1 of the form (name, date of birth, place of birth, organization, position title, duty station, social security number, and work phone number). 2) The contractor shall complete section 5 (Project Requiring Highest ADP Level) using the assigned security clearance for each employee's position.

e. Two sets of fingerprints on separate copies of form FD-258,
1) The Contractor Security Liaison shall help arrange fingerprinting for each contractor and subcontractor employee. Fingerprinting can usually be done at a local police station. (Electronic fingerprints are not accepted at this time.) 4. Each contractor must ensure that the forms are complete and that all contractor employee required security screening forms are transmitted to the COR within two (2) business days of an employee starting work on an IES contract.

a. The Contractor Security Liaison must collate the forms in each security screening package by
employee and transmit a complete set of security screening documents for each employee to the COR via courier (e.g., Federal Express) using a tracking number with signature required,

b. The COR will not accept security screening packages that are not collated by employee (i.e., all
forms noted in point 3 above will be bundled by employee). The COR will review all security screening documents for each contractor employee for completeness, returning any incomplete security screening documents to the Contractor Security Liaison for completion. The contractor must resubmit the completed security screening documents to the COR within 7 business days or the contractor employee must be removed from the contract. No contractor employees are permitted unsupervised access to unclassified sensitive information (personally identifiable information), direct access to respondents who are minors, or Department of Education IT systems until they have resubmitted applicable screening documents. 14

5. The COR will submit the completed packages of security screening documents to the IES Security
Representative for processing. 6. The IES Security Representative reviews each package of security screening documents and electronic information submission to ensure everything required has been provided and either rejects the package, sending it back to the submitter for completion/correction or releases it to ED's Chief of Personnel Security. In the event that an application is rejected at this stage, the contractor must resubmit the corrected forms to the COR, or have the contractor employee correct the e-QIP submission, within two business days. The IES Security Representative must be notified as soon as the updated e-QIP submission is completed. 7. The contractor employee application for each individual in a moderate risk level position must be submitted to ED's Chief of Personnel Security within 14 days of the date the contractor employee starts working on the contract. Contractor employees in High Risk IT (6C) Level positions require preliminary personnel security screenings before they are given access to unclassified sensitive information or Department of Education IT systems. 8. After a package of security screening documents is transmitted to ED Chief of Personnel Security, the Office of Management security staff conducts a further review and either rejects the package of security screening documents, sending it back to the submitter for completion/correction or releases it to OPM. 9. OPM then assigns an investigator to conduct the type of investigation indicated by the department (this is tied to the level of access to PII that the applicant will have). 10. The Chief of Personnel Security will request the expansion of background investigations to obtain additional information to the extent necessary to make personnel acceptability or suitability determinations. These determinations will be made using criteria established by the OPM for the purpose of determining suitability for employment in the Federal competitive service, as described in 5 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 731.202, and other OPM guidance as applicable. The Chief of Personnel Security determines whether a contractor employee is acceptable for the position from a personnel security standpoint. 11. When the OPM investigation is complete, the RSA form with the clearance indicated is sent to ED's Office of Management for processing. 12. The Office of Management returns the RSA form to the IES Security Representative for recordation and distribution to the COR. 13. The COR transmits the RSA form with clearance indicated to the Contractor Security Liaison for their records and for distribution to the Contract Project Leader. 14. The Contract Project Leader then distributes copies of the clearance to the employee. 15. The Chief of Personnel Security will inform the IES COR when he or she determines that a contractor employee is not acceptable to render service(s) or, if appropriate, to otherwise perform under a contract. 16. Each contractor will officially notify its contractor employee if he or she will no longer work on an ED contract. 17. In the event a contractor employee is deemed unacceptable for the position from a personnel security standpoint, the Chief of Personnel Security will usually provide the contractor employee with an opportunity to refute, explain, clarify, or mitigate information in question. 15

18. If, after final determination by the Chief of Personnel Security, a decision is made that the contractor
employee is not acceptable to render services on a contract and access is denied, the COR will inform the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer must inform the contractor (i.e. employing firm) that the contractor employee is not acceptable to render services in this particular position, or, if appropriate, to otherwise perform under the contract. The contractor will notify the contractor employee. A final determination cannot be appealed. 19. At any time during the life of the contract a contractor or subcontractor employee (including any field staff) discontinues work on the contract or leaves the employment of the contractor, the contractor shall notify the COR within two days of the date that the employee is no longer working on the contract or within one business day if removed for cause. The contractor shall provide the reason why the employee is no longer working on the contract. The COR will provide this information to the IES Security Representative. 20. Each contractor is responsible for the protection of sensitive or Privacy Act-protected information from unauthorized use or misuse by its employees, subcontractors, or temporary workers, and for preventing access to others, who are not authorized and have no need to know such information. 21. The contractor shall submit monthly information to the COR indicating which employees were billed to the contract that include the e-QIP number of the person being billed. The COR will reject payments to employees without an e-QIP number. For employees with pre-existing clearances from other contracts, this shall be noted on the monthly payment form. The contractor shall verify with the COR that the security screening processes have not changed by the time the contract is active.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
CLOUD HOSTING SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR THE INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES

Introduction This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) sets forth procedures and guidelines that the Department of Education will use to monitor performance of the Contractor under this contract. A copy of this plan will be furnished to the contractor so that the contractor shall be aware of the methods that the Government will employ in monitoring performance on this project and address any concerns that the contractor may have prior to initiating work. Purpose of the QASP The QASP is intended to accomplish the following:   Define the roles and responsibilities of participating Government officials and outside experts; and Describe the process of quality assurance surveillance.

Each of these purposes is discussed in detail below. Roles and Responsibilities of Participating Government Officials The following Government Officials will participate in assessing the quality of the contractor's performance. Their roles and responsibilities are described as follows: Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR will be responsible for monitoring, assessing, recording, and reporting on the technical performance of the contractor on a day-today basis. The COR will also be responsible for inspecting all deliverables submitted under this contract and providing a recommendation regarding the acceptability of the deliverable to the Contracting Officer. It is essential that the COR establish and maintain a team-oriented line of communication with the Contractor's Project Director (PD) in order to perform monitoring functions. The COR, CO, and PD must work together as a team to ensure that required work is accomplished in an efficient and proper manner. Meetings should be held on a regular basis in order to resolve serious problems. Less serious problems should be discussed and resolved on an impromptu basis. The Contracting Officer (CO) will have overall responsibility for overseeing the contractor's performance. The Contract Specialist will be responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of the contractor's performance in the areas of compliance, administration, cost control and property control; reviewing the COR's assessment of the contractor's performance; and resolving all differences between the COR's version and the contractor's version. The CO may call upon the expertise of other Government individuals as required.

Quality Assurance Surveillance Process Even though the Government, through the COR, will be monitoring the contractor's performance on a continuing basis, the volume of tasks performed by the contractor makes technical inspections of every task and step impractical. Accordingly, the Department of Education will use a quality-assurance review process to monitor the contractor's performance under this contract through the contract deliverables, specifically through a review of the timeliness of submission and the acceptability of the content of each deliverable. The COR will inspect each deliverable and recommend acceptance of the deliverable to the Contracting Officer. In the event the COR has a concern regarding the timeliness or quality of the content of a deliverable, the contractor shall be notified as well as the Contracting Officer shall be notified. The Contractor's performance shall be documented and measured through the annual past performance evaluation through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). Performance will be evaluated in the areas of:      Quality of Product or Service Timeliness of Performance Cost Control Problem Resolution Business Relations

The following rating elements will be used to evaluate each area:  Exceptional. Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective. Score: 4 Very Good. Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective. Score: 3 Satisfactory. Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory. Score: 2 Marginal. Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. Score: 1 Unsatisfactory. Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective. Score: 0

BILLING INSTRUCTIONS
The Department wants all of our contractors to understand how the Department processes invoices The basic rule is this, The Department will pay invoices within 30 days of receipt of a proper invoice, yet close to the 30th day. There are two key terms that determine when the 30 day clock starts--receipt and proper invoice. Receipt occurs on the latter of: 1) Invoices are transmitted electronically through email (OCFOCAMInvoicing@ed.gov), we look for the date a readable transmission is received by our office, or if it is received after normal working hours we will use the next business day. 2) The seventh day after the date on which the property is actually delivered or the performance of services is actually completed. This date may not be accurate if the contract calls for a longer acceptance period or if we actually accept goods or services before the seventh day. (5 CFR Â§ 1315.4) 3) On the date of delivery, if specified in the contract. 4) On the date placed on the invoice by the contractor, if we fail to annotate the date of receipt in our office. Second, what makes an invoice a proper invoice? An invoice is deemed proper through the following process. We receive your invoice, and then we review it for the following information, if the information is complete then we pay it: 1) Name of vendor 2) Invoice date 3) Government contract number (10 digits) 4) Vendor invoice number, account number, or other number identified in the contract 5) Description (including, for example, contract line/subline number), price, and quantity of goods or services rendered. 6) Shipping and payment terms (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract) 7) TIN (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract) 8) Banking information for payment by EFT (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract) 9) Contact name (where practicable), title and telephone number 10) Other substantiating documentation or information required by the contract. This documentation should include information regarding where the requested funds were spent. We need to see detailed labor hours per task, travel expenses (where travelers went, transportation costs, etc.), supplies purchased, etc. If we determine that your invoice is not proper, we will return it to you and identify all defects that prevent payment. You should correct the invoice and return it to us for payment. 5 CFR Â§ 1315.9 It is the goal of the Department to pay small business invoices within 15 calendar days from the date in which the invoice was received.
NOTE--There is a difference between an invoice and a voucher. Since the FAR refers to "prope r invoices" when applying the Prompt Payment Act, we will use the term invoice also. This does not mean that vouchers are not covered in the same manner.

52.212-1 -- Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (February 2012) Addendum to 52.212-1 Â­ Proposal Instructions I. General Instructions

The US Department of Education (ED) intends to award a firm-fixed-price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to a single, successful offeror.

It is anticipated that the resulting contract will be divided into the following tasks at the time of award:     Task 1 Â­ Server Operations Support Task 2 Â­IaaS Solution Task 3 Â­ System Licenses (Task Order Requirement) Task 4 Â­ Technical Writing (Task Order Requirement)

Work under Task 3--System Licenses and Task 4--Technical Writing will be issued as firmfixed priced task orders, as the need arises. The contractor shall not perform the following tasks unless ED issues a task order. There will be a minimum of at least one task order for Task 3 and Task 4, but no more than 15 task orders and 5 task orders for Task 3 and Task 4 per year, respectively. Offerors should prepare separate technical and business proposals for the project. Each proposal should be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of the other. Cost information should be restricted to the business proposal and the technical proposal must not contain reference to specific costs (although resource information may be included so that the offeror's understanding of the scope of the work may be evaluated). Past performance information should be included in the technical proposal. An official authorized to bind your organization must sign the proposals. You must submit the technical proposal electronically in WORD AND PDF format and the business proposal as an EXCEL WORKBOOK AND PDF to Jennifer.Arthur@ed.gov. In addition, you must submit one original and 5 hard copies of your technical proposal and one original and 5 hard copies of your business proposal. The proposals should not be bound and offerors are encouraged to submit proposals in ring binders. Offerors are also encouraged to produce double-sided copies in order to conserve paper and to use recycled paper with a high post-consumer waste content. Proposals are due by 12:30 PM, ET on August 20, 2012, and shall be delivered to: U.S. Department of Education 19

Offerors are encouraged to suggest improvements to the approaches detailed in the SOW, along with a justification of the merits of these alternative approaches. Offerors may find it necessary to make adjustments to the schedule provided in the SOW, in accordance with the newly proposed strategies and/or procedures. In this case, offerors shall clearly identify any changes in the schedule and explain their rationale. Technical Proposals must not exceed 25 sheets of paper, double-sided.

24

Second, the offeror must send the "Contractor Performance Information" form (Attachment B) to current or previous clients. Each current or previous client that agrees to be a reference for the offeror must complete the form and return it to the Contract Specialist, Jennifer Arthur, as prescribed on the form. Completed forms from references are due on the same day as Technical & Business Proposals under this solicitation. Completed "Contractor Performance Information" forms will not be accepted from references who are employed with a parent or an affiliate of the offeror. The Government reserves the right to contact past performance references to verify the information provided. The Government also reserves the right to obtain past performance information from other sources. IV. Business Proposal

ED anticipates awarding a fixed price contract through a small business set aside competition. The offeror shall submit proposed prices for each task, including the task order requirements, based on the proposed price for the relevant deliverables. The offeror shall also include proposed prices for the project overall. Please note that the Government must make a determination that the price is fair and reasonable; therefore, please provide your complete price buildup to explain how you arrived at your total price per task. Price buildup should take into account yearly escalation rates. In addition, the resultant contract will include FAR clause 52.217-8 if the successful offeror will need additional time to perform services beyond the life of the contract (i.e., beyond the 12month base period and four one-year options). As such, offerors must price out their services starting at the 12-month base period and ending at the six month extension beyond base and option periods. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to authorize any extension of up to 6 months beyond the life of the contract. The Government estimates that the overall level of effort required to undertake the tasks described in this Statement of Work is approximately one base year and four option periods (with one person equaling one Full-time Equivalent or 2,080 hours.) This information is provided for offeror's information only and is not considered restrictive for proposal purposes. The page limit of 25 sheets of paper, double-sided does not apply to the business proposal section. V. Conflict of Interest Plan

The offeror shall submit a Conflict of Interest Plan, providing details on its policies and procedures to identify and avoid potential organizational or personal conflicts of interest (or 25

apparent conflicts of interest). The Plan should also address procedures taken to neutralize or mitigate such conflicts, if they have not been or cannot be avoided. The Plan should indicate that such policies and procedures are operative throughout the period of performance of the contract. The policies should address, at a minimum, gifts, outside activities, financial interests, or other significant connections or identifications that would establish, or give the appearance of establishing, a conflict of interest. A method for periodically reviewing financial interests of employees, subcontractors and consultants, and their immediate families, in order to assess actual or apparent conflicts of interest, should be included in the plan. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The thoroughness, completeness and effectiveness of the Plan shall be evaluated as part of the offeror's overall quote. The Plan will be incorporated into the contract awarded to the successful offeror. Offerors and all proposed subcontractors/consultants shall complete the Conflict of Interest Certification from EDAR 3452.209-70, provided in the clause section, and include in their business proposal. The page limit of 25 sheets of paper, double-sided does not apply to the Conflict of Interest Plan. The Conflict of Interest Plan may be presented in the offeror's business proposal. (End of Addendum) 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (January 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Although price is an important factor, technical merit is significantly more important than price. As technical merit becomes more equal, price will become a more significant factor. The Contracting Officer will determine whether any difference in technical merit is worth the difference in price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1. Technical Qualifications and Experience of the Proposed Staff Â­ 40 points  Demonstrates experience, technical training and other qualifications that are appropriate for the task assignments; experience in fields related to the task assignments.  Demonstrates experience supporting websites and database driven web applications; web application and database migrations, problem solving, data backups, and security and patch management; managing physical and virtual servers; virtual server migrations; Windows Server OS; Internet Information Services (IIS); .NET; Microsoft SQL Server; Active Directory and RADIUS services; network load balancers; implementing federal IT regulations.  Demonstrates experience handling federal data systems and sensitive statistical data. 2. Quality and Soundness of the Technical Proposal--35 points  Demonstrates clear understanding of the purpose and context of potential activities and task orders, the major issues and objectives of the contract, and 26





how they related to each task. Demonstrates a clear understanding of the requirements of the IaaS solution as detailed in the statement of work, including web based management interface and application programming interface (API) for managing services, scalable services, network load balancing, and hosting facilities in multiple geographical locations within the continental United States; includes a wide range of services and options for virtual servers, virtual storage, and network connectivity; demonstrates a clear understanding of security requirements and privacy concerns; Quality of the activities proposed to accomplish each task, including the clarity, feasibility, creativity, and soundness of plans for implementing out each task and the identification of any anticipated problems and recommended solutions.

3. Past Performance--15 points  Evidence of prior successful work in conducting projects of similar nature. Consideration of the offeror's reputation in terms of quality, problem resolution, cost control, timeliness, business relations and customer service will be evaluated. 4. Quality of the Management Plan--5 points  Demonstration that the project management and staffing plan will result in timely and quality products delivered within budget, including clear lines of responsibility, corporate oversight, budget accountability and reporting, and relations with subcontractors.  Appropriate matching of staff skills to task requirements. 5. Corporate Capability and Related Experience--5 points  Evidence of the feasibility of producing high quality work products in a timely manner; evidence of prior successful experience in website support, technical writing, database development. TOTAL: 100 POINTS Basis for award: For this requirement, the results of the technical evaluation shall outweigh the results of the price evaluation. As the technical evaluations become more equal, the price shall become a more significant factor. However, to be considered for an award, an offer must be fairly and reasonably priced. The Contracting officer shall determine whether any difference in technical evaluation is worth the difference in price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 27

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Other End Products: Line Item No. Country of Origin ______________ _________________ ______________ _________________ ______________ _________________ [List as necessary] (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 35

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Â§6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Â§6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Â§6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. Â§362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that-- (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-- (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and

(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).

3452.209-70--Conflict of Interest Certification (May 2011) (a) (1) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: (i) Unequal access to information. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to nonpublic information through its performance on a government contract. (ii) Biased ground rules. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract. (iii) Impaired objectivity. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent, or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. ``Impaired objectivity'' includes but is not limited to the following

39

situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: (A) Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; (B) Significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property, or services; or (C) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property, or services. (2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. (3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term ``potential conflict'' means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if ``impaired objectivity'', or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. (e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e). 40

(f) Conflict of Interest Certification. The offeror, [insert name of offeror], hereby certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Quote No. [insert number] that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term ``potential conflict'' means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest).
