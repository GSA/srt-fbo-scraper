6.  Evaluation Method:
The Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) will track the response to the requirements of inspected tasks, conduct a comparison with actual
maintenance performance, and otherwise verify and validate contractor performance.  The contractor will monitor compliance as required by clause
52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in persons, and report any issues to the Contracting Officer.  Help desk ticket logs and automated reports
generated from the software will be used as documentation and compared to the AQL specific to the task.


7.  Incentives:
The following remedies apply: In the event that the IBM authorized re-seller ceases providing support for any computer program, then IBM, the
original equipment manufacturer, shall as part of its standard commercial procedures, provide at no additional charge one of two possible
solutions
               o a replacement IBM computer program (the "Replacement Program") which is Generally Available to IBM customers and which provides
                 similar, equal or greater substantially equivalent features, functionality and pricing as the Unsupported Computer Program.
               o At DISA's option, retain the original product, and IBM shall continue to maintain the product and provide documentation for the
                 product (provided continuing support and maintenance is provided) at no additional cost.
               o If resolution is not completed within the performance standard, the invoice will be reduced by the percentage of downtime
                 attributable to Severity-1 level error. For example, if downtime is attributable to IBM software issue and a system is down 2
                 hours, the invoice for the month of performance will be reduced by 2%.

2. Contract. IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) Software as a Service (SaaS)

3. Background.
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Enterprise Services Directorate (ESD) is in the process of systematically upgrading its event
monitoring capabilities in support of all Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs). DISA ESD has undertaken an effort to enhance and improve
its monitoring architecture for several years. There are a multitude of managed elements including Oracle databases, security configurations,
storage devices, network devices, network appliance profiling, joint enterprise Microsoft applications such as DoD Enterprise Email (DEE), DoD
Enterprise Portal Services (DEPS) and others, facility equipment, websites, and transactions. Managing the vast number elements at DECCs around
the world was previously achieved by utilizing a multitude of tools. ESD Enterprise Service Monitoring (ESM) tools include Oracle Enterprise
Manager (OEM), Access Security Configuration and Control (ASCC)/(BMC BladeLogic, McAfee Host Based Security System (HBSS), CA eHealth/Spectrum,
Netscout, Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Iconics, Hewlett-Packard (HP) SiteScope, and HP Business
Availability Center (BAC). Non-standard event management of ESD’s monitoring tools, results in the generation of duplicate events and inaccurate
events. In order to correlate and streamline the event management process and support data sharing among other DISA organizations including
Network Services, ESD has implemented a standard event correlation tool and intends to send all events to the single enterprise event
correlation layer known as Netcool OMNIbus.


4. Objectives:
The objective is to provide ITM SaaS to include the licensing and maintenance to meet current and future mainframe and distributed workloads,
security, and modernization requirements, while ensuring DISA customers receive uninterrupted, continuous access to their applications and data.
This project will be sustained under the SaaS model to provide existing levels of ITM licensing and maintenance, as well as allow for future
surge as required. Under the SaaS model, all required software licensing and maintenance support is provided by the contractor.

5. Scope.
The contractor shall provide ITM SaaS for current usage as well as future increases. The scope of this contract is for an IBM authorized
reseller/partner to provide licensing, maintenance, and future upgrades of the software for the length of the contract. The number of Resource
Value Units (RVUs) required is currently approximately 10,000, but with surge of roughly 3,400 RVUs per year.


6. Performance Requirements.
Software services will be managed under the SaaS model. Under this model, all required software licensing and application administration will be
provided by the contractor in a single variable cost structure invoiced monthly. Government usage levels will be monitored and adjusted monthly
to provide only the staffing, services, and licensing necessary to meet the Government’s requirements.


6.1. Task 1 – Provide Software Maintenance Support as Authorized Reseller
The contractor shall provide software maintenance support for IBM Tivoli Monitoring software as an Authorized Reseller. Maintenance includes,
but is not limited to; new releases and version upgrades to licensed software, revisions, corrections of reported errors, enhancements (to
include instructions for implementation and operation for all maintenance levels and product versions), technical support, contractor
resolutions to problems or failures, and DISA’s right to receive the most current commercial release or version of the contractor’s product.

6.1.1 - IBM Tivoli Monitoring software:  The contractor shall ensure that the Software Products and any product enhancements associated with the
products in this contract will support commercially available operating systems, hardware, and processing environment technologies including,
but not limited to, 64-bit architecture, Sysplex environments, IBM System z (zLinux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server); X-
86 (Windows Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Solaris, VMware); Itanium (HP-UX, HP VSE); SPARC, Solaris, Solaris
zones and Ldoms; IBM System p (AIX, AIX LPARs); and HP-UX, Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, RedHat Linux, SUSE Linux, and Windows Server Operating Systems
and their associated follow-on operating systems software.

6.1.2 - Asset Documentation:  The contractor shall provide the necessary software documentation to ensure DISA is current with the most up-to-
date information on the software vendor’s products deployed within DISA’s Enterprise. At a minimum, the documentation shall address product
functionality, functionality updates, and product operating specifications referenced by product release dates. Due to the critical emphasis on
IT asset configuration management and inventory accounting throughout DISA and the DoD, the contractor shall provide DISA with written
notification(s) of changes to product names, descriptions and product numbers for products listed in the schedule of supplies and services as
changes occur. Notification of changes resulting from product upgrades and renaming or repackaging of products shall be provided as changes. The
contractor shall identify the product name, description and product number on the contract to be replaced with the new product name, description
and product number (for accurate cross-reference and historical purposes). Annually, the contractor shall update the contract's schedule of
supplies and services and submit the updated draft schedule of supplies and services to the Contracting Officer (CO) and the COR of the contract
in Microsoft Excel compatible format for contract modification and incorporation. For the life of the contract, the product upgrades and renamed
or repackaged products added to the contract shall retain the same firm-fixed prices provided in the schedule of supplies and services and
designated as current versions of these products and services.

The contractor on an annual basis sixty (60) days prior to the end of the current year, the contractor shall provide a cross-reference
(“mapping”) of the products, versions, and/or configuration changes associated with the managed software provided to DISA.  This cross-reference
and any product configuration changes shall be notated in a draft revised schedule of supplies and services that the contractor shall provide to
the CO and the COR of the contract. If there are product dependencies required for certain software products to be operational, contractor will
assist in identifying such dependencies as well as no charge options bundled with the licensed software products and available to DISA. Upon
review and approval from the COR, any contractor product updates will be used to revise the schedule of supplies and services of the contract
for the upcoming option year. The revised schedule of supplies and services will be incorporated into the contract as a contract modification
and used as the baseline for the upcoming option year.

6.1.3 - License Inventory: DISA will conduct and manage the license inventory reconciliation process based on RVU’s. Reconciliation of the
inventory will be conducted on a monthly basis. Any increases or decreases of usage executed during the month shall be submitted with the
reconciled inventory provided by the Government.  Government usage levels will be monitored and adjusted monthly to provide only the staffing,
services, and licensing necessary to meet the Government’s requirements.  The contractor shall invoice in accordance with the fixed rate.


6.1.4- Releases/Updates/Revisions: DISA shall be entitled to all new versions, releases, updates, revisions and options of contractor provided
software products, including updates to product documentation as they become generally available (GA) from the software vendor.
The contractor shall provide support for each software product version. For any product covered under the contract, if the software vendor
discontinues the product, replaces the product, merges the product with another product or products, repackages/renames the product or otherwise
redesigns the product into another product or products with similar or equal functionality, DISA shall be entitled to the new product
functionality, containing the equivalent functionality, at no additional cost.

6.1.5 - End of Life/Sunsetting (End of Service): The contractor shall provide twelve (12) months’ notice to the CO and COR for any and all End-
of-Life (EOL) or product “sunsetting”. The notice may be provided electronically and should be made at the same time the product termination
notification is made generally available. The CO or COR will acknowledge receipt of the notice within five business days following receipt. The
contractor agrees to work with DISA to identify a functional replacement product, costs for the functional replacement product, possible
compatibility concerns and implementation guidance for the functional replacement product.


6.1.6 – Maintenance Support: The contractor shall provide Internet-based maintenance support to facilitate status reporting (acceptance and
socialization) of software problems, and provide downloads of software patches, fixes, and documentation.
      6.1.6.1    The contractor’s product support staff shall be accessible via a toll-free support line and available to assist in resolving
software errors, answering questions regarding installation procedures, compatibility with other software and general questions of the licensed
software.

6.2. Task 2 – Provide the Ability to Purchase Additional Licenses/Units/Capacity as Required by SaaS model:  Under this SaaS model, all required
ITM software licensing/maintenance and application technical support is provided by the contractor.  Government usage levels will be monitored
and adjusted monthly.  The contractor shall provide DISA the ability to increase or decrease licenses/value units of the ITM software as usage
requires.

6.2.1 - Central Processing Unit:  The IBM SaaS solution shall be applicable in physical/hard and virtual/soft partitioned operating
environments. DISA may partition through either physical/hard or virtual/soft partitioning. DISA shall only pay for software services for the
partitions on which contractor provided programs are running. The SaaS solution shall be provided for ITM software provided however usage
charges are applicable only on installed software provided under this contract, which may be operating at less than the total CPU/Processor or
machine capacity. Charges apply to production software where the provided software is installed and executed for its intended purpose.


6.2.2 - Non-Production Software Usage: DISA shall have the right to use the contractor provided software to perform non-production business
operations. There shall be no additional charge for non-production testing or usage of the contractor provided software products, regardless of
the usage levels established daily/monthly in the contract. These non-production business operations are critical to the success of computing
services for the DoD and include, but are not limited to, the following areas:
      • Quality Assurance/Quality Acceptance (QA) testing
      • Integration Testing
      • Release Management testing and distribution
      • Disaster Recovery/Continuity of Operations (COOP)/Assured Computing Environment (ACE) testing

Software versions, releases, and maintenance fixes may be subjected to a centralized installation compatibility assurance checkout in a test
environment at a DISA managed facility. This test environment may or may not be on the same CPU/processor on which the production software
resides. Software subjected to installation compatibility checkout will not be made available for production, development use, or execution on
other than the test domain.

6.2.3 - Disaster Recovery: Software can be copied and installed for backup and disaster recovery purposes and operated in a backup or disaster
recovery mode.
Back-up, Disaster Recovery, and Disaster Recovery Testing (COOP) refers to the use of installed software to perform disaster recovery testing,
disaster recovery, and production environment back-up operations. Disaster recovery software is activated to test a program or in response to a
production outage within the Enterprise. Software programs may be permanently installed for disaster recovery purposes. Should DISA need to test
a software program or initiate back-up production in response to a production outage, all software programs associated with the original
production environment shall be run as a back-up disaster recovery environment, regardless of capacity thresholds. There shall be no additional
charges for the first ninety (90) days of disaster recovery testing or back-up production in response to a production outage. If after ninety
(90) days, the software is still running in a disaster recovery mode on a back-up computer, charges shall be calculated based on the size of the
back-up environment on which the software is operating and in accordance with the terms of this contract.  The Government shall have the right
to perform Disaster Recovery/COOP testing for up to a maximum of fifteen (15) days per Disaster Recovery/COOP test for each licensed product at
no additional cost.


6.2.4 - Identification of Possible Significant Surge:  Dependent on changing requirements and new projects and software systems, each year, the
Government may require a significant increase in the services provided by this contract. The Government may provide up to 50% increase in the
total contract lifecycle funded amount to support increased software requirements.  Any increase or change to the contract will be approved via
a contract modification before service begins.

As prescribed in 4.804 (S-90), insert the following clause:

                                           CONTRACT/ORDER CLOSEOUT—FIXED-PRICE, TIME-AND-MATERIALS, OR
                                                              LABOR-HOURS (JAN 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order. The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order. A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification. A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order. If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an
invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period
of performance to allow for deobligation of excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

                                                                 (End of clause)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that
exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the
clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of
operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size
standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling
or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In
determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of
employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements,
facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.

(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its
size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the
following:

(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the
novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to
include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts--

(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that
corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard
corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/content/table-small-business-size-standards.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a
construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by
validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and
its other data in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The
Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have
been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is
not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in SAM, or does not have a representation in SAM for the NAICS code
applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office,
along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

The Contractor represents that it (  ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code      - assigned to contract number      .

(Contractor to sign and date and insert authorized signer's name and title).

indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" after the date of the clause.

52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have      , have not      , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of

(1)   Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.

(2)   The offeror’s price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404.  Competition is anticipated;

in a clear and useful format.

(4)        The offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness.  The total evaluated will be the sum of all

effect immediately prior to exercising any option period in accordance with FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.  Ensure you include the
pricing in your proposal – not in the total.  It will be used as a validation IAW 52.217-8


(4)   For EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY.  Total evaluated price will be calculated as provided in Attachment A, Pricing Template.  Contractor shall
propose a single price, per CLIN on the Attachment A, Pricing Template.

2. Contract. IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) Software as a Service (SaaS)

3. Background.
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Enterprise Services Directorate (ESD) is in the process of systematically upgrading its event
monitoring capabilities in support of all Defense Enterprise Computing Centers (DECCs). DISA ESD has undertaken an effort to enhance and improve
its monitoring architecture for several years. There are a multitude of managed elements including Oracle databases, security configurations,
storage devices, network devices, network appliance profiling, joint enterprise Microsoft applications such as DoD Enterprise Email (DEE), DoD
Enterprise Portal Services (DEPS) and others, facility equipment, websites, and transactions. Managing the vast number elements at DECCs around
the world was previously achieved by utilizing a multitude of tools. ESD Enterprise Service Monitoring (ESM) tools include Oracle Enterprise
Manager (OEM), Access Security Configuration and Control (ASCC)/(BMC BladeLogic, McAfee Host Based Security System (HBSS), CA eHealth/Spectrum,
Netscout, Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Iconics, Hewlett-Packard (HP) SiteScope, and HP Business
Availability Center (BAC). Non-standard event management of ESD’s monitoring tools, results in the generation of duplicate events and inaccurate
events. In order to correlate and streamline the event management process and support data sharing among other DISA organizations including
Network Services, ESD has implemented a standard event correlation tool and intends to send all events to the single enterprise event
correlation layer known as Netcool OMNIbus.


4. Objectives:
The objective is to provide ITM SaaS to include the licensing and maintenance to meet current and future mainframe and distributed workloads,
security, and modernization requirements, while ensuring DISA customers receive uninterrupted, continuous access to their applications and data.
This project will be sustained under the SaaS model to provide existing levels of ITM licensing and maintenance, as well as allow for future
surge as required. Under the SaaS model, all required software licensing and maintenance support is provided by the contractor.

5. Scope.
The contractor shall provide ITM SaaS for current usage as well as future increases. The scope of this contract is for an IBM authorized
reseller/partner to provide licensing, maintenance, and future upgrades of the software for the length of the contract. The number of Resource
Value Units (RVUs) required is currently approximately 10,000, but with surge of roughly 3,400 RVUs per year.


6. Performance Requirements.
Software services will be managed under the SaaS model. Under this model, all required software licensing and application administration will be
provided by the contractor in a single variable cost structure invoiced monthly. Government usage levels will be monitored and adjusted monthly
to provide only the staffing, services, and licensing necessary to meet the Government’s requirements.


6.1. Task 1 – Provide Software Maintenance Support as Authorized Reseller
The contractor shall provide software maintenance support for IBM Tivoli Monitoring software as an Authorized Reseller. Maintenance includes,
but is not limited to; new releases and version upgrades to licensed software, revisions, corrections of reported errors, enhancements (to
include instructions for implementation and operation for all maintenance levels and product versions), technical support, contractor
resolutions to problems or failures, and DISA’s right to receive the most current commercial release or version of the contractor’s product.

6.1.1 - IBM Tivoli Monitoring software:  The contractor shall ensure that the Software Products and any product enhancements associated with the
products in this contract will support commercially available operating systems, hardware, and processing environment technologies including,
but not limited to, 64-bit architecture, Sysplex environments, IBM System z (zLinux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server); X-

6.2. Task 2 – Provide the Ability to Purchase Additional Licenses/Units/Capacity as Required by SaaS model:  Under this SaaS model, all required
ITM software licensing/maintenance and application technical support is provided by the contractor.  Government usage levels will be monitored
and adjusted monthly.  The contractor shall provide DISA the ability to increase or decrease licenses/value units of the ITM software as usage
requires.

6.2.1 - Central Processing Unit:  The IBM SaaS solution shall be applicable in physical/hard and virtual/soft partitioned operating
environments. DISA may partition through either physical/hard or virtual/soft partitioning. DISA shall only pay for software services for the
partitions on which contractor provided programs are running. The SaaS solution shall be provided for ITM software provided however usage
charges are applicable only on installed software provided under this contract, which may be operating at less than the total CPU/Processor or
machine capacity. Charges apply to production software where the provided software is installed and executed for its intended purpose.


6.2.2 - Non-Production Software Usage: DISA shall have the right to use the contractor provided software to perform non-production business
operations. There shall be no additional charge for non-production testing or usage of the contractor provided software products, regardless of
the usage levels established daily/monthly in the contract. These non-production business operations are critical to the success of computing
services for the DoD and include, but are not limited to, the following areas:
      • Quality Assurance/Quality Acceptance (QA) testing
      • Integration Testing
      • Release Management testing and distribution
      • Disaster Recovery/Continuity of Operations (COOP)/Assured Computing Environment (ACE) testing

Software versions, releases, and maintenance fixes may be subjected to a centralized installation compatibility assurance checkout in a test
environment at a DISA managed facility. This test environment may or may not be on the same CPU/processor on which the production software
resides. Software subjected to installation compatibility checkout will not be made available for production, development use, or execution on
other than the test domain.

6.2.3 - Disaster Recovery: Software can be copied and installed for backup and disaster recovery purposes and operated in a backup or disaster
recovery mode.
Back-up, Disaster Recovery, and Disaster Recovery Testing (COOP) refers to the use of installed software to perform disaster recovery testing,
disaster recovery, and production environment back-up operations. Disaster recovery software is activated to test a program or in response to a
production outage within the Enterprise. Software programs may be permanently installed for disaster recovery purposes. Should DISA need to test
a software program or initiate back-up production in response to a production outage, all software programs associated with the original
production environment shall be run as a back-up disaster recovery environment, regardless of capacity thresholds. There shall be no additional
charges for the first ninety (90) days of disaster recovery testing or back-up production in response to a production outage. If after ninety
(90) days, the software is still running in a disaster recovery mode on a back-up computer, charges shall be calculated based on the size of the
back-up environment on which the software is operating and in accordance with the terms of this contract.  The Government shall have the right
to perform Disaster Recovery/COOP testing for up to a maximum of fifteen (15) days per Disaster Recovery/COOP test for each licensed product at
no additional cost.


6.2.4 - Identification of Possible Significant Surge:  Dependent on changing requirements and new projects and software systems, each year, the
Government may require a significant increase in the services provided by this contract. The Government may provide up to 50% increase in the
total contract lifecycle funded amount to support increased software requirements.  Any increase or change to the contract will be approved via
a contract modification before service begins.
