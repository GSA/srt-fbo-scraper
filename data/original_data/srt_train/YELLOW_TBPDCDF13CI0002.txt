Introduction
Introduction to CDFI Fund

The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (hereafter "CDFI Fund") was formed through the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The CDFI Fund is an award-making organization with the mission to "expand the capacity of financial institutions to provide credit, capital, and financial services to underserved populations and communities in the United States." The CDFI Fund provides grants, loans, equity, secondary capital, and tax credit allocation authorization to organizations certified as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Community Development Entities (CDEs), and to other qualified organizations. The major active financial assistance programs administered by the CDFI Fund include the Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) Program, Capital Magnet Fund (CMF) Program, Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Program, the Native American CDFI Assistance (NACA) Program, and the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program. The CDFI Fund is also in the process of starting a major Bond Guarantee (BG) Program for CDFIs. Through monetary awards and the allocation of tax credits (and soon bond guarantees), the CDFI Fund helps promote access to capital and local economic growth in urban and rural low-income communities across the nation. Through its various programs, the CDFI Fund enables locally-based organizations to further goals such as:    Economic development (job creation, business development, and commercial real estate development) Affordable housing (housing development and homeownership) Community development financial services (enhanced capitalization of financial institutions and provision of basic banking services and financial literacy training to underserved communities).

The CDFI Fund promotes these goals and the overall economic empowerment of the Nation's underserved and distressed communities by working through financial institutions to increase the capacity of these financial institutions and to thereby enhance these communities' access to financial products and services. Unlike many federal agencies that award funds directly to individuals and organizations, the CDFI Fund works through intermediaries (i.e., CDFIs and CDEs) to provide technical and financial assistance to economically distressed communities.

1.2

Objective

The primary objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) and resulting contract is to procure and implement an awards management information system (AMIS). AMIS shall be a Web-based, commercially-available off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS), or single software architecture enterprise application software (e.g., customer relationship management (CRM) software, business process management (BPM) software, enterprise TBPDCDF13CI0002

21 of 123

content management (ECM) software, etc.) product, hereafter, referred to as AMIS, that can be configured to meet the CDFI Fund's awards management requirements. AMIS will support the CDFI Fund's certification and award/allocation programs through all phases of the programs' life cycle, for each one of the business units that supports the mission of the CDFI Fund. This awards management modernization initiative is expected to enable the CDFI Fund to reduce information technology (IT) costs, increase organizational efficiency in processing and servicing applications, and provide higher accuracy, transparency, and scalability to the CDFI Fund's mission-critical processes. This initiative is therefore expected to realize benefits in the areas of both cost savings and improved services.

1.3

Background

AMIS will replace the CDFI Fund's existing legacy certification management and awards management manual and automated tools and systems. The current systems are at end-oflife, do not meet the present and future business requirements, and are too costly to operate. The CDFI Fund performed a Grants Management Line of Business (GMLoB) fit-gap analysis and demonstrated that none of the approved GMLoB consortium leads are immediately available or cost-effective, as they do not align well with the CDFI Fund's current business processes without significant modifications. The CDFI Fund has obtained a waiver from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirement to join the GMLoB consortia, and has received approval to procure and implement an awards management information system based on a commercial item software solution or as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution (e.g., cloud computing environment) that meets the CDFI Fund's business requirements.

1.4

General Overview of the CDFI Fund Award Processes and Programs

The CDFI Fund provides grants, loans, equity, secondary capital, and tax credit allocation authorization to organizations certified as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Community Development Entities (CDEs), and to other qualified organizations. Both the certification and award programs share similar needs and processes with differing business rules to accept, evaluate, score, make award determinations, and manage certifications and awards. Although unique business rules and workflows will need to be configured for each, it is important to note that some program data are shared across the certification and award programs, and that some business rules and workflows must be designed to enable cross-cutting processes and sharing of data. The CDFI Fund anticipates that a fully implemented AMIS will employ the capability for flexible business rules development to automate, to the extent possible, aspects of post-award/post-disbursement evaluation and compliance testing for the entire portfolio of financial awards and tax credit allocations.

1.4.1 CDFI Fund Program Processes
The CDFI Fund administers certification programs for CDFIs and CDEs. These certifications have value in the marketplace on their own and in most cases are also prerequisites to apply and receive financial and tax credit awards from the CDFI Fund. Some CDFI Fund programs make awards to non-certified organizations (e.g., Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) Program, Capital Magnet Fund (CMF) Program). Often, certification and funding/allocation applications are processed in parallel, in which case uncertified organizations are allowed to apply to funding/allocation programs. However, the ability of those organizations to receive an award is contingent on the outcome of the certification application. CDFI and CDE certification applications are accepted throughout the year. Once certified, organizations may receive awards from the CDFI Fund's monetary and tax credit programs, on an annual basis. Each funding/allocation application goes through a competitive review process. The CDFI Fund announces the selected applicants who receive award funding or tax credit allocations. Once an Assistance Agreement or Allocation Agreement is signed, the process to disburse an award may begin (for the monetary programs). An organization receiving the award must submit annual reports in line with the terms and conditions of the Assistance/Allocation Agreement. For more information, please refer to the CDFI Fund's website at www.cdfifund.gov. The CDFI Fund's awards management function includes a strong post-award and postdisbursement evaluation component, which is informed both by the results of CDFI Fund program reporting requirements and also by risk analysis that highlights awardees and allocatees whose financial viability and programmatic performance requires special attention from the CDFI Fund's compliance management staff. The CDFI Fund strives to use automation to facilitate a risk-based approach to its compliance activities. The CDFI Fund takes several important steps in order to ensure that its post-award/post-disbursement evaluation function is a robust effort, including:        Ensuring compliance of awardees and certified organizations to standards and conditions (which may include financial, programmatic, and reporting requirements) contained in partially-customized award agreements; Reviewing financial statements of awardees and allocatees, and addressing entities whose overall financial health presents a demonstrated risk for continued investment of public funds, or their continued viability for receiving and managing federal funds; Assessing investments in awardees made in the form of loans and equity capital to ensure continued satisfactory performance of those investments; Reviewing reports required from awardees and allocatees in compliance with their assistance and allocation agreements on a timely basis; Analyzing compliance reports for accuracy and data integrity, identifying cases of non-compliance with assistance and allocation agreements; Performing site visits and desk audits/reviews of transaction-level investment data, for awardees and allocatees for which higher level analysis indicates potential risk of continued public investment; Addressing promptly with awardees and allocatees instances of delinquencies in reporting required data, making required loan payments, or any other actions required by assistance or allocation agreements;

TBPDCDF13CI0002

23 of 123

 

Pursuing corrective actions in response to instances of non-compliance in reporting, delinquencies in managing loan or equity investments, or any other exceptions to requirements under assistance and allocation agreements; and Rendering findings of default and imposing appropriate sanctions when warranted.

Many federal agencies fund awards that are specifically project- or activity-based, with postaward compliance requirements evaluated prior to funds disbursement that is proportional to percentage of completion of the project or activity. At the CDFI Fund, typically, there are relatively few requirements for awardees to achieve agency authorization for full disbursement of funds. Post-award/post-disbursement requirements for the CDFI Fund's awards portfolio of grants, loans, equity, secondary capital, and tax credit allocations reflect the Government's expectations for awardees and allocatees to expand access to capital and investments in community and economic development in the markets they serve. Because in most cases, the CDFI Fund disburses its awards ahead of awardees accomplishing programmatic goals that will take place over many years, the CDFI Fund's post-award/postdisbursement requirements are focused largely on the awardee/allocatee's performance as institutions as well as on the projects and businesses in which they invest. As a result, postaward/post-disbursement evaluation manifests a combination of traditional public sector compliance monitoring and other evaluation aspects that may be more analogous to the ongoing non-financial component of monitoring of outstanding commercial loans or equity investments (e.g., using automated tools to ensure borrowers are reporting financial statements on schedule, that loan proceeds are being used in accordance with covenants, risk ratings are assigned and updated periodically, etc.) or long-term programmatic investments by private foundations.
1.4.1.1 Award Life Cycle

All CDFI Fund award programs follow a similar life cycle process. Applications for award funding and tax credits are received on an annual funding round basis1. The process consists of the following steps: 1. Development and publishing of Notice of Funds Availability (NOFA)/Notice of Allocation Availability (NOAA)/Notice of Guarantee Authority (NOGA) and associated program documentation. 2. Outreach and training for applicants and announcements of funding alerts. 3. Development of Award/Allocation Application Packages (fully electronic), including instructions and regulations. 4. Electronic application intake, including but not limited to Grants.gov and a CDFI Fund Web-based portal (online forms and document submission). 5. Eligibility review including, but not limited to, acceptance of eligible applications and the rejection of applications that do not meet completeness, certification requirements (if necessary), acceptable past performance, and other eligibility criteria.

For purposes of this document, "award" will refer to both monetary awards and tax credit allocations. Similarly, "awardee" will refer to recipients of either monetary awards or tax credit allocations. However, if a specific report or process is referenced, "award/allocation" or "awardee/allocatee" will be used.

6. Reviewer selection, training, and review, including, but not limited to: reviewer preselection, conflict of interest review, case assignment, and reviewer evaluation and correspondence. 7. Application review, including evaluation policy methodology documentation, applicant categorization, past performance scoring, award amount modification, matching fund and other applicable requirements, development of final ranking and approval documentation, and award determination. 8. Obligation/allocation. 9. Public announcement. 10. Notice of Award (NOA) and debriefings. 11. Determination/development of performance goals and measures. 12. Assistance/Allocation Agreements inclusive of performance goals and measures and compliance terms. 13. Disbursement/subsequent disbursement/de-obligation/de-allocation. 14. Compliance reporting by awardee, based on Assistance Agreement requirements for report submission and meeting loan requirements. 15. Compliance management, including corrective actions and sanctions, as appropriate. 16. Award Amendments. 17. Award closeout.
1.4.1.2 Certification Life Cycle

All CDFI Fund certifications follow a similar life cycle process. Unlike applications for award funding and tax credits which are received on an annual funding round basis, applications for certification are accepted and reviewed year-round. The process at a high level is similar to the award process (described above), with the most significant exception being that there is no award or assistance granted. Rather, the organization is deemed certified and is able to receive an award for one of the CDFI Fund's award programs. The certification process consists of the following steps: 1. Development and publishing of certification guidance and requirements. 2. Outreach and training for applicants and announcements of funding/allocation program-related due dates. 3. Development of the certification application package (fully electronic), including instructions and regulations. 4. Electronic application intake (online forms and document submission). 5. Eligibility review, including but not limited to: acceptance of eligible applications, rejection of applications that do not meet completeness, acceptable past performance, and other eligibility criteria. 6. Reviewer selection, training, and application review, including but not limited to: conflict of interest review, case assignment, and reviewer evaluation and correspondence. 7. Second level review in determination of certification decision. 8. Notice of certification decision to applicant. 9. Certification agreement, inclusive of compliance terms and material events report (optional). 10. Compliance determination based on report submission. TBPDCDF13CI0002

1.4.2 CDFI Fund Programs
The CDFI Fund accomplishes its mission through the following programs:
1.4.2.1 Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Certification

CDFI certification is a designation conferred by the CDFI Fund. A Community Development Financial Institution is a community-based specialized financial institution that serves lowincome people or works in economically distressed communities, often working in market niches that may be underserved by traditional financial institutions. Only financial institutions certified as CDFIs by the CDFI Fund can receive financial assistance awards through the CDFI Program and the Native American CDFI Assistance (NACA) Program. Technical Assistance awards are available for both programs to certified CDFIs and entities that propose to become certified. CDFIs must be recertified on an annual basis.
1.4.2.2 Community Development Entity (CDE) Certification

CDE certification is another designation conferred by the CDFI Fund. CDEs are eligible to apply for allocation of tax credit authority through the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program. A CDE is a domestic corporation or partnership that is an intermediary vehicle for the provisions of loans, investments, or financial counseling in low-income communities through the NMTC Program. Many CDEs create multiple subsidiary CDEs to own specific assets or classes of assets; thus the number of CDEs is much greater than CDFIs. A CDE certification does not expire.
1.4.2.3 Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Program

The CDFI Program is one of the primary ways that the CDFI Fund works to achieve its mission. The purpose of the CDFI Program is to use federal resources to invest in CDFIs and to build their capacity to serve low-income people and communities that lack access to affordable financial products and services. Through the CDFI Program, the CDFI Fund provides two types of monetary awards to CDFIs - Financial Assistance (FA) awards and Technical Assistance (TA) awards. Since 1994, the CDFI Fund has awarded more than $874 million in FA and TA awards through the CDFI Program.

1.4.2.3.1 Financial Assistance (FA) Awards
The CDFI Fund makes awards of up to $2 million to certified CDFIs under the FA component of the CDFI Program. A CDFI may use the award for financing capital, loan loss reserves, capital reserves, or operations. FA awards are made in the form of equity investments, loans, deposits, or grants, and the CDFI may be required to match its FA award dollar-fordollar with non-federal funds of the same type as the award itself. This requirement enables CDFIs to leverage private capital to meet the demand for affordable financial products and services in economically distressed communities.

1.4.2.3.2 Technical Assistance (TA) Awards:
TA grants allow certified CDFIs and established entities seeking to become certified to build their capacity to provide affordable financial products and services to low-income TBPDCDF13CI0002

26 of 123

communities and families. Grants may be used for a wide range of purposes. For example, awardees can use TA funds to purchase equipment, materials, or supplies; for consulting or contracting services; to pay the salaries and benefits of certain personnel; and/or to train staff or board members. The CDFI Fund makes awards of up to $100,000 under the TA component of the CDFI Program.
1.4.2.4 New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program

The NMTC Program was established by Congress in 2000 to spur new or increased investments into operating businesses and real estate projects located in low-income communities. The NMTC Program attracts investment capital to low-income communities by permitting individual and corporate investors to receive a tax credit against their federal income tax returns in exchange for making equity investments in specialized financial institutions called Community Development Entities (CDEs). The credit totals 39 percent of the original investment amount and is claimed over a period of seven years (five percent for each of the first three years, and six percent for each of the remaining four years). The investment in the CDE cannot be redeemed before the end of the seven-year period. NMTC Allocation Agreements require allocatees to notify the CDFI Fund of the receipt of a Qualified Equity Investment (QEI) within 60 calendar days of originally receiving the QEI. AMIS must allow allocatees to comply with this requirement by collecting information about the QEIs issued by the allocatee or any eligible subsidiary Community Development Entity; collecting information about the investors who provided the QEIs; and allowing an allocatee to transfer any or all or its allocation award to authorized subsidiary CDEs. Since the NMTC Program's inception, the CDFI Fund has made 594 awards allocating a total of $29.5 billion in tax credit authority to CDEs through a competitive application process. This $29.5 billion includes $3 billion in Recovery Act Awards and $1 billion of special allocation authority to be used for the recovery and redevelopment of the Gulf Opportunity Zone.
1.4.2.5 Native American CDFI Assistance (NACA) Program

The CDFI Fund's Native Initiatives are designed to overcome identified barriers to financial services in Native Communities. These initiatives seek to increase the access to credit, capital, and financial services in Native Communities through the creation and expansion of CDFIs primarily serving Native Communities. The NACA Program is very similar to the CDFI Program, both offering financial assistance and technical assistance grant awards. Both the NACA and CDFI programs use the same award application and have similar processes, with different business rules. Through the NACA Program, the CDFI Fund provides funding to build the community development capacity of Certified Native CDFIs, Emerging Native CDFIs, and Sponsoring Entities, and to increase access to capital in Native Communities. Funding is offered in two forms:

1.4.2.5.1 Financial Assistance (FA) Awards ­
Only Certified Native CDFIs are eligible to receive FA awards. The awards are made in the form of loans, grants, deposits, and equity investments to support the Certified Native CDFIs' financing activities and may require the awardee to match the CDFI Fund's award dollar-fordollar with funds from a non-federal source. TBPDCDF13CI0002

27 of 123

1.4.2.5.2 Technical Assistance (TA) Grants ­
TA grants are offered to Certified Native CDFIs, Emerging Native CDFIs, and Sponsoring Entities. Awardees may use TA dollars to increase their capacity to serve Native Communities and/or to create or become Certified Native CDFIs.
1.4.2.6 Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) Program

The BEA Program was created in 1994 to support Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured financial institutions around the country that are dedicated to financing and supporting community and economic development activities. The BEA Program complements the community development activities of insured depository institutions (i.e., banks and thrifts) by providing financial incentives to expand investments in CDFIs and to increase lending, investment, and service activities within economically distressed communities. Providing monetary awards for increasing community development activities leverages CDFI Fund dollars and puts more capital to work in distressed communities throughout the nation. The BEA Program provides formula-based grants to applicants for increasing qualified activities from a baseline period to an assessment period.
1.4.2.7 Capital Magnet Fund (CMF) Program

Through the Capital Magnet Fund Program, the CDFI Fund provides competitively awarded grants to CDFIs and qualified non-profit housing organizations. CMF awards can be used to finance affordable housing activities as well as related economic development activities and community service facilities. Awardees will be able to utilize financing tools such as loan loss reserves, loan funds, risk-sharing loans, and loan guarantees to produce eligible activities whose aggregate costs are at least ten times the size of the award amount.
1.4.2.8 Bond Guarantee (BG) Program

The CDFI Fund is currently implementing the Bond Guarantee Program and anticipates releasing program documents by the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. The Bond Guarantee Program was enacted through the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-240) on September 27, 2010. The legislation directs the Treasury Department to guarantee the full amount of notes or bonds issued to support Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that make investments for eligible community or economic development purposes. The bonds or notes will support CDFI lending and investment by providing a source of longterm capital to CDFIs. The Treasury Department may guarantee up to 10 bonds per year, each at a minimum of $100 million. The total of all bonds cannot exceed $1 billion per year. The CDFI Fund will work with the Federal Financing Bank (FFB) in administering this program. The CDFI Bond Guarantee Program is authorized through fiscal year 2014.
1.4.2.9 Financial Education and Counseling (FEC) Pilot Program

The CDFI Fund no longer makes awards through the FEC Pilot Program, and as such, the program is no longer active. The program was in effect for only two years (FY 2009 and FY 2010). Through the FEC Pilot Program, the CDFI Fund provided grants to eight organizations to enable them to provide a range of financial education and counseling services to prospective homebuyers. Please note that FEC Pilot Program historical data will need to be converted to AMIS. Table 1 lists each active program offered by the CDFI Fund, identifying whether it is a certification or award program, including the type of award. TBPDCDF13CI0002

1.4.3 CDFI Fund's Current Awards Management Landscape
There is approximately 80 CDFI Fund staff supporting the certification and award programs at the CDFI Fund. Furthermore, many external users come into contact with CDFI Fund programs and processes as reviewers, government entities, applicants, awardees, etc. Currently there are approximately 7,700 organizations and 31,500 users who are registered as external users with the CDFI Fund. Organizations and users are continually registering with the CDFI Fund. As of April 2013, there were 1,004 certified CDFIs, the most in the CDFI Fund's history, serving all states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. This includes 38 CDFIs newly certified since the beginning of FY 2012. The CDFI Fund expects the number to continue to grow, as they are certifying more organizations each month. As of April 2013, there were 6,025 certified CDEs, headquartered in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. This number includes 727 CDEs newly certified since the beginning of FY 2012. Since CDEs are typically established to take advantage of New Markets Tax Credits on a project-specific basis, the CDFI Fund expects the number of CDEs applying for certification to continue to grow. Moreover, these certified CDE figures include both "Applicant CDEs" and "Subsidiary CDEs." Subsidiary CDEs only exist in relationship to Applicant CDEs, which are the parent entities of Subsidiary CDEs. Approximately one-third of all CDEs are Applicant CDEs and two-thirds are Subsidiary CDEs. Table 2: 2011 CDFI Fund Award and Allocation Activity CDFI Program TBPDCDF13CI0002 NACA Program BEA NMTC

1.5.1 Present Computing Environment
CDFI FUND/TTB infrastructure consists of two primary data centers. The data centers provide the services required for day-to-day support of end users (email, file shares, etc.) as well as host the custom business applications. Each data center supports High Availability (HA), including local redundancy with no single points of failure. In addition, each data center supports Disaster Recovery (DR); capable of individually supporting 100% of CDFI FUND/TTBs services in the event of an emergency with minimal data loss. To support DR, CDFI FUND/TTB uses replication technologies for Oracle, Microsoft SQL, Microsoft Exchange, EMC Celerra Replicator, and EMC RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines. The data centers are located within government facilities at CDFI FUND/TTB HQ in Washington, DC and the National Revenue Center (NRC) in Cincinnati, OH. For CDFI FUND/TTBs Office Automation and Application environment, the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has virtualized over 70% of its Microsoft Windows server platform using VMware for IIS Web, Microsoft SQL, and SharePoint servers. In addition CDFI FUND/TTBs custom applications are 30% virtualized, utilizing Sun Virtualization technology, as well as Linux running on VMware. To access custom applications, non-CDFI Fund personnel access Java based applications hosted on Web portals. The applications run on an n-tier J2EE application architecture. These users access the Web portal hosted in a firewall-protected DMZ via proxy and Web servers, residing behind Bigip Load Balancers and Web Application Filters (WAF). All business logic requests from the Web server are hosted on application servers, which in turn request information from the Oracle database server. For the application server, CDFI FUND/TTB primarily uses Oracle WebLogic and has begun to leverage JBoss. CDFI FUND/TTB uses Oracle Discoverer Plus and Viewer products as well as SAS Data Analytics to support its canned and ad hoc reporting needs. There are also applications that leverage Oracle Forms and Reports served to the users via the Oracle application server (no fat client footprint). In an effort to reduce total life cycle costs and provide products to production in less time, CDFI FUND/TTBs OCIO has begun leveraging Web-based, commercially-available off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions. The CDFI Fund's standard client workstation image is Windows 7 with Office 2010. The CDFI Fund also leverages a virtual desktop infrastructure utilizing the Citrix XenDesktop platform. Workstations and browsers are configured to meet National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) security guidelines and support HSPD-12 credentialing. The networking environment consists of Cisco routers, switches, and Virtual Private Network (VPN) devices, Cisco Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone system, Cisco and Tandberg Video Teleconferencing, Web Application Firewall, Web Proxies, and F5 Load Balancers. CDFI FUND/TTBs storage and server environment consists of EMC Storage Area Network (SAN) disk arrays and SAN switches, Windows Server 2008R2, Exchange 2010 cluster, Microsoft SQL 2008 cluster, SharePoint 2007 cluster, VMware 4/5 cluster, Red Hat Linux, Sun Solaris 10, and 11g Databases. The User computing environment consists of a variety of printers and scanners, Windows 7 workstation images, Citrix XenDesktop 5 and Citrix XenApp 6 Farm.
1.5.1.1 Legacy Systems and Databases Supporting Certification and Award Processes

There are more than 17 legacy systems and tools supporting the CDFI Fund's certification and award processes. Currently these systems are hosted on Microsoft Web servers as well as Microsoft SQL Database servers. Since its inception in 2001, the database has grown from 5 GB, to 300 GB today. The current data architecture consists of 29 databases, TBPDCDF13CI0002

31 of 123

comprised of roughly 2,700 tables, 2,600 views, and 90,000 columns. The CDFI Fund's current enterprise architecture (EA) diagram is included in Appendix 2: CDFI Fund Enterprise Architecture. The CDFI Fund current data flow through legacy systems and databases is included in Appendix 3: Data Flow Through CDFI Fund Legacy Systems and Databases. Fifteen legacy systems are being retired with the implementation of AMIS. Two of the CDFI Fund's existing systems, CIMS and CIIS, will be maintained and will be interfaced with AMIS.

1.5.1.1.1

CDFI Fund Information and Mapping System (CIMS)

CIMS is a modeling tool used for mapping economically distressed communities. CIMS is available for geocoding addresses, mapping Census tracts and counties, and determining the eligibility of Census tracts and counties under the CDFI Fund's various programs' distress criteria. CIMS modeling outputs include maps and worksheets. External users use CIMS to generate and submit maps to the CDFI Fund, and CDFI Fund staff members approve or reject maps submitted by external users. Also, maps are generated internally for diverse business purposes. CIMS mapping is an integral aspect of determining how awardees and allocatees serve different geographic areas. CIMS is a Web-based application developed using Esri ArcGIS for Serve and the PenBay Solutions InVision Viewer for Flex. The GeoCoder is based on Esri ArcGIS Online. The following CIMS technical information is provided:

Objectives

The primary objective of this effort is to procure and implement an awards management information system (AMIS). AMIS shall be a Web-based, commercially-available off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS), or a single software architecture enterprise application software (e.g., customer relationship management (CRM) software, business process management (BPM) software, enterprise content management (ECM) software, etc.) product that can be configured to meet the CDFI Fund's awards management requirements. The system shall have the capability to accept certification and program applications, facilitate review of applications, and manage the award and compliance requirements. The CDFI Fund envisions using risk analysis to monitor and assess the health of its awardees/allocatees and ensure that CDFI Fund awards and allocations are properly used. Specifically, the CDFI Fund's portfolio-wide risk analysis plan will define key compliance and oversight indicators that increase the risk profile of an award/allocation or awardee/allocatee (e.g., size of awards, historical performance, internal controls, etc.); assess the likelihood and severity of these risks; triage risk-monitoring activities based on the relative levels of risks; and take corrective action as needed. These risk analyses are expected to improve the award decision-making process and drive successful--and compliant--completion of performance goals. If proposing a COTS or GOTS solution, the CDFI Fund requires that the core solution be designed specifically for use by award/grant-making organizations. If an enterprise application software is being proposed, the solution must be able to be personalized and configurable to meet the awards management processes and requirements. The functionality of the AMIS product, out of the box, shall be capable of managing and reporting on data related to multiple programs using an automated workflow to facilitate the CDFI Fund's processes. The product shall rely on configuration predominantly made through the product's user interface, preferably without the need for major customization/development efforts outside of the existing product. The CDFI Fund has a preference for a solution that has been successfully implemented by federal government award/grant-making agencies. The AMIS solution shall require little to no client-side components. The system shall provide a robust, feature-rich, scalable, and configurable capability to support management and operational reporting on performance of individual process workflows and the overall end-toend process. The objectives set forth below describe those features, technologies, and services that the CDFI Fund requires in accordance with capabilities that are mature and readily available in the awards management information system industry. If proposing a COTS or GOTS solution, the AMIS solution shall be deployed on government-furnished equipment and licensed for use in development, test, disaster recovery, and production environments. The CDFI Fund will be procuring and implementing AMIS to accomplish the following highlevel capabilities:

SCOPE OF WORK AND DESCRIPTION OF TASKS
Scope

3.1

The CDFI Fund seeks a Contractor to stand up, configure, and implement a secure, robust, and scalable awards management information system (AMIS). AMIS will support the CDFI Fund's certification and award programs through all phases of the programs' life cycle, for each of the business units that support the operations of the CDFI Fund, while providing reliable access to certification and program data. AMIS shall provide seamless integration with historical applicant, award, and compliance data. The scope of work and deliverables identified in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) will include the procurement of a solution which shall either be hosted in TTB's environment, or alternatively, be offered as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution (e.g., cloud computing environment). If the Contractor is proposing AMIS as a COTS solution, the Contractor's proposal shall be worded and submitted such that the intended solution shall be consistent with TTB's enterprise architecture (EA), and provide seamless integration with the CDFI Fund's network. If the Contractor is proposing AMIS as a SaaS solution, the Contractor's proposal shall be worded and submitted addressing the integration with TTB's enterprise architecture, as needed. The CDFI Fund requires the Contractor to follow a modified version of TTB's Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and processes in order to produce the documentation and perform the tasks required to implement the mandatory requirements in the AMIS solution. TBPDCDF13CI0002

54 of 123

This section is generally based on the tasks and deliverables required for a solution which will be hosted at TTB. The CDFI Fund recognizes that a SaaS solution implementation may require further consideration and modification to the SDLC processes and deliverables. If further variation of the standard SDLC methodology is required, the Contractor shall work with CDFI Fund's designated Project Management Office (PMO) Project Manager, and TTB and the CDFI Fund stakeholders to define and clearly document the variation. The agreedupon methodology must then be submitted and approved using the SDLC Waiver Request Form. The TTB's SDLC Handbook is provided in Appendix 8: TTB Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Handbook. Furthermore, the Contractor shall follow an iterative implementation approach, where the core AMIS solution shall first be architected and initially stood up in a non-production environment (Section 3.4) while defining and configuring the product to support the mandatory requirements that apply across all of the CDFI program areas (Section 3.5). The Contractor shall follow an iterative and repeatable approach to then define and configure program-specific processes for each iteration. Therefore, the Contractor shall complete the scope defined in each of the following sections for each iteration: Project Management and Oversight (Section 3.3), Design and Configure CDFI Fund Program-Specific Processes (Section 3.6), CIIS and CIMS Interface Design and Development (Section 3.7), Legacy Data Migration and Conversion (Section 3.8), Testing (Section 3.9), Training (Section 3.10), and Production Deployment (Section 3.11). The following is a proposed AMIS iterative program implementation order. The final order in which the Contractor shall implement the programs may be altered based on the common understanding between the Contractor and the CDFI Fund of the requirements and scope of work: 1. Iteration 1 shall include the implementation of the following programs:  Cross-Program Functionality  CDFI Certification  CDE Certification  CDFI Program  NACA Program (very similar to the CDFI Program, as previously noted) 2. Iteration 2 shall include the implementation of the following programs:  NMTC Program  BEA Program 3. Iteration 3 shall include the implementation of the following programs:  CMF Program  BG Program  Other, if applicable At the completion of the base period, the Contractor shall fully deploy all of the CDFI Fund programs and legacy data in the proposed AMIS solution. The total period of performance for this task order will be from the date of the award through a not-to-exceed period of 120 total months.

STANDARDS COMPLIANCE

The Contractor shall comply with CDFI Fund, TTB, and federal government standards and guidelines through the life of the contract.

Conformity to TTB Systems Development Life Cycle Handbook
Documentation created by the Contractor specifically for the CDFI Fund shall conform to the requirements found in Appendix 8: TTB Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Handbook. Out-of-the-box documentation available from the Contractor for the COTS AMIS software can be used in lieu of TTB's SDLC template format if it follows TTB SDLC guidelines and all required content is addressed. The Contractor shall supplement any out-of-the-box documentation, as necessary.

Conformity to TTB Baseline Security Requirements
The United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB), evolved from the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC), is a federal government-wide initiative that provides guidance to agencies to create security configuration baselines for IT products widely deployed across federal agencies. USGCB currently exists for Microsoft Windows 7. Additionally, the Center for Internet Security (CIS), provides security benchmarks that TTB utilizes when other guidelines are not available. CIS provides benchmarks for Windows and UNIX servers, Internet Web browsers, and application/Web servers.    The Contractor shall certify applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the USGCB for Windows 7. The Contractor shall certify that applications are fully functional and operate correctly as intended on systems using the CIS benchmarks for Windows/UNIX servers, application/Web servers, and Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10). The standard installation, operation, maintenance, updates, and/or patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the approved USGCB configuration. The Contractor shall also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default "program files" directory and shall be able to silently install and uninstall. Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges. The Contractor shall design, implement, test, and deploy the application following a set of secure coding guidelines (such as the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Principles).

 

The TTB Baseline Security Requirements (BLSR) Matrix is derived from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. All section and subsection headings in this TTB Baseline Security Requirements Matrix directly correspond to those headings in NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4. The TTB BLSR Matrix provides consistent and repeatable security controls for moderate information systems categorized in accordance with Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 199 (FIPS PUB-199). All Contractor-provided work shall conform to Appendix 16: TTB Baseline Security Requirements Matrix.

TBPDCDF13CI0002

76 of 123

Compliance with the CDFI Fund's Baseline Security Requirements
The CDFI Fund is responsible for the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) and authority to operate for the AMIS software. The AMIS Contractor shall comply with the CDFI Fund's baseline security requirements as stated in the CDFI Fund IT Security Program's Software Security Guide found in Appendix 11.

Conformity to the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002
The Contractor's technical solution shall conform to the Privacy Provisions of the EGovernment Act of 2002 to ensure privacy in the conduct of federal information activities. Additional information on the E-Government Act of 2002 can be obtained at: http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/omb/egov/g-4-act.html.

Conformity to the TTB Configuration Management Handbook
Unless otherwise agreed to in advance and in writing by all parties, all Contractor-provided work shall conform to the requirements found in Appendix 17: TTB Configuration Management (CM) Handbook. The Handbook describes the Bureau's strategy for implementing configuration management (CM) in support of enterprise architecture (EA) hardware and any systems developed or maintained by the Bureau. It explains the Bureau's approach to CM, defines the organization needed to support CM, and identifies the CM responsibilities of the members of the TTB organization.

Conformity to the TTB Enterprise Architecture Document (EAD) and the Enterprise Architecture Technical Reference Model (EA TRM)
The Contractor shall propose and implement a system design that is in compliance with the TTB Target Enterprise Architecture Document (EAD), TTB Transition EAD, and the Enterprise Architecture Technical Reference Model (EA TRM) in the TTB Target EAD (Appendix 18: TTB Target Enterprise Architecture Document and Appendix 19: TTB Transition Enterprise Architecture Document, respectively). These standards define the approved software used to support software development and system architecture. The software standards to be used for system development will be those that are defined in the TTB Target EA Document/TTB Transition EA Document or agreed to by TTB in advance.

Conformity to TTB Data Management (DM) Requirements
All Contractor-provided work shall conform to the relevant data management requirements as prescribed in Appendix 14: TTB Data Management (DM) Handbook.

Quality Assurance
This section identifies the most important quality factors for the AMIS implementation. The assessment of these quality factors helps in setting expectations and standards that will ensure implementation of a high-quality system. Correctness Correctness is the extent to which all specified functions are implemented, the design is documented according to standards, and the software's performance is within the criteria set for performance. Correctness is important because data contained in AMIS is sensitive and accessible only by authorized users. Functionality supporting AMIS business needs shall be designed and implemented to accurately store, present, and manipulate/transform data. For instance, data values shall accurately store in the database and accurately present through TBPDCDF13CI0002

77 of 123

the user interface the correct value entered; calculations/logic manipulating/transforming data shall accurately reflect formulas specified. Efficiency Efficiency is the extent to which resources needed to provide the required functionality are affordable. Workflow through the system shall be intuitive, clear, and concise to support a streamlined process rather than creating extra steps or requiring an inordinate number of screens in order to accomplish any given task. Expandability Expandability is the ability to enhance the functionality or performance of the software. Use of a COTS product will limit the expandability of functionality. However, with the limited functionality come shorter implementation time and less implementation risk. Flexibility Flexibility is the extent to which modifying the software for different environments requires little more than a user interface or change of data, without resorting to expandability-type changes. This is also related to the ability of the AMIS to be customized/configured to support changes to regulations, processes, and applications that govern the application submission, review, and approval processes. Integrity Integrity is the assurance that the software and data are not being tampered with or stolen and that the software is performing updates appropriately. Security and access controls shall comply with TTB's Baseline Security Requirements (please refer to Appendix 10: TTB Baseline Security Requirements). Interoperability Interoperability is the extent to which the software can be easily coupled with other systems, and the results will comply with industry standards. Interoperability is important to ensure that AMIS is capable of integrating with Grants.gov and interfacing with other CDFI Fund systems, i.e., the Community Investment Impact System (CIIS) and the CDFI Fund Information and Mapping System (CIMS), and with the Bureau of the Public Debt's Oraclebased financial management system. Maintainability Maintainability is the ease of finding and fixing errors to allow production to continue, even with the issuance of new releases. With limited maintenance and operational resources to support the system, maintainability is a high priority. This includes the ability to obtain technical support during planning, installation, and into operations. The Contractor shall provide support and maintenance (e.g., technical support) through multiple means (e.g., phone, website, email, knowledge base) during normal business hours (7:00 a.m. through 7:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST)). Support and maintenance shall include access to patches, service packs, bug fixes, and general releases (upgrades). Where a reliance on third party relationships/products exists, those dependencies shall be identified. Usability Usability is the extent to which the system is user-friendly, documentation is thorough and accurate, and few keystrokes are required per command. Usability is important to AMIS users to enhance the ease of learning, allowing users to become readily familiar with the system and to navigate intuitively between its Web pages. The user interface design is TBPDCDF13CI0002

78 of 123

modern, Web-enabled, intuitive, and has a consistent look and feel (e.g., the solution provides consistency in commands, dialog windows, data structures, and information presentation between Web pages and integrated systems). Reliability Reliability addresses the prevention of inaccurate results, slow response, system "freezes" (stops without recovery), and system failures. To increase the reliability of the system, AMIS shall provide automated mechanisms to recycle processes, recover memory from leaks, and provide commit/rollback mechanisms in the event of a system error (e.g., Web browser crash or network failure). Accessibility Accessibility provides assurance that the system complies with the EIT Standards including Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Response Time Response time for a system is generally measured from initiation of request (e.g., click or button press) to the complete rendering of the user interface with the results of the action. Extended response time impacts user productivity and is tied to the complexity of the request/action being taken within the system. In general, low-complexity functionality (e.g., logging in, navigating between screens) is expected to provide a response within 5 seconds; generation of simple reports and limited queries is expected to provide a response within 10 seconds. High-complexity functionality (e.g., generation of complex reports or large data sets returned from queries) may increase system response time; however, any response greater than 30 seconds is considered unacceptable. The Contractor shall assist with determining cause and remediation of excessively slow response (e.g., response time greater than 30 seconds). Security  Dependability: Dependable software executes predictably and operates correctly under all conditions, including hostile conditions and when the software comes under attack or runs on a malicious host.  Trustworthiness: Trustworthy software contains few if any vulnerabilities or weaknesses that can be intentionally exploited to subvert or sabotage the software's dependability. In addition, to be considered trustworthy, the software must contain no malicious logic that causes it to behave in a malicious manner.  Survivability (also referred to as "Resilience"): Survivable--or resilient--software is software that is resilient enough to: (1) either resist (i.e., protect itself against) or tolerate (i.e., continue operating dependably in spite of) most known attacks plus as many novel attacks as possible, and (2) recover as quickly as possible, and with as little damage as possible, from those attacks that it can neither resist nor tolerate.

8 SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS
Conflict of Interest (COI) Associated with Agency Services
Due to conflict of interest issues inherent in this contract, Offerors are excluded from participating in this solicitation if they are under contract with TTB to perform IT program management services, IT services and software maintenance support, or any other oversight work for TTB. TTB is currently providing IT program management services support to the CDFI Fund through an Interagency Agreement. These services are expected to continue into the future; therefore, the AMIS Contractor will be excluded from performing IT program management services, IT services and software maintenance support, or any oversight work for TTB.

Key Personnel
Contractor employees proposed by the Offeror are designated as key personnel for this contract and are listed as follows: # Key Position 1 TBD 2 TBD 3 TBD 4 TBD The Contractor shall submit the resume of the Contractor employee(s) that will fill the position(s) identified in the table above.

Security Performance at Government Sites
The Contractor shall coordinate with and receive approval from the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) prior to Contractor personnel accessing the CDFI Fund, other government agencies, and/or other Contractor facilities.

Contractor Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements
Performance of this contract requires Contractor personnel to have a federal governmentissued personal identification card before being allowed unsupervised access to a government facility and/or information system. The COR will be the sponsoring official, and will make the arrangements for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) and card issuance. At least two business weeks before start of contract performance, the Contractor shall identify all Contractor and subcontractor personnel who shall require physical and/or logical access for performance of work under this contract. The Contractor must make its personnel available at the place and time specified by the COR in order to initiate screening and TBPDCDF13CI0002

87 of 123

background investigations. The following forms, or their equivalent, will be used to initiate the credentialing process: The designated Standard Form. Fillable forms available at: www.opm.gov/forms/html/sf.asp OF 306. Fillable forms available at: www.opm.gov/forms/htmlfof.asp 1-9 Form, Documents utilized in identity proofing at: www.uscis.gov/files/form/i-9.pdf Fingerprint Card Release to Obtain Credit Information Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card application Contractor employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. Government personnel may contact the Contractor personnel being screened or investigated in person, by telephone or in writing, and the Contractor agrees to make them available for such contact. Alternatively, if an individual has already been credentialed by another agency, and that credential has not yet expired, further investigation may not be necessary. In this case, the Contractor shall provide the COR with documentation that supports the individual's status. During performance of the contract, the Contractor shall keep the COR apprised of changes in personnel to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes. Cards that have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR and Issuing Office within 18 hours or no later than the next business day. Replacement shall be at the Contractor's expense. If reissuance of expired credentials is needed, it will be coordinated through the COR. At the end of contract performance, or when a Contractor employee is no longer working under this contract, the Contractor shall ensure that all identification cards are returned to the COR. If the Contractor does not return all identification cards, the last payment may be withheld. Before starting work under this contract, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint check will be conducted and the appropriate level background investigation will be initiated. The minimum level background investigation conducted will be a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI). This provides for the Government to positively identify and make a suitability determination of the individual applying for access under this contract. If at any point during this process investigative results are unfavorably adjudicated, the individual will be denied admittance to work on the contract, including both physical and/or logical access. If it is determined that the sensitivity of the government information that will be accessed under this contract is Critical-Sensitive in nature, then it may be required that the background TBPDCDF13CI0002

88 of 123

investigation be completed and adjudicated prior to granting the Contractor access. Upon receipt of a favorable FBI fingerprint check, an identification card will be issued and access will be granted. In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the Government concerning the suitability of an individual to perform work under this contract, the Government will have the right of final determination. This requirement must be incorporated into any subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have regular and routine unsupervised physical access to a federally-controlled facility for six (6) months or more, or any unsupervised logical access to a federally-controlled information system. Physical Access is the ability to enter a federally-owned facility or federally-leased space. If federal space is limited to a portion of a building then Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 applies only to that portion owned or leased by the federal government. Physical access requirements do not apply to: Contractors (permanent, intermittent, temporary, or seasonal), guest researchers, and volunteers needing access for less than six (6) months. Logical Access: Ability to access federal IT systems or databases - applies to everyone regardless of how long access is required and whether within a federal facility or by remote connectivity. Additional information regarding HSPD-12 can be located by clicking one of the following links: http://csrc.nist.gov/piv-project http://arc.publicdebt.treas.gov/files/pdf/fsbpdapplicanttrainmodfinal.pdf The applicable Contractor employees shall not begin working under this contract until all security forms have been properly completed and submitted.

Identification/ Badges
All Contractor employees shall be required to wear identification badges when working in government facilities.

Personnel Removal and Replacement
The applicable Contractor employees are subject to investigation/re-investigation by the Government. Applicable Contractor employees who undergo Contractor background investigations that reveal, but are not limited to, the following, may be unacceptable under this contract: conviction of a felony, a crime of violence or a serious misdemeanor, a record of arrests for continuing offenses, or failure to file or pay federal income tax. The Government reserves the right to determine if a Contractor employee assigned to a task will continue with the task. The Contractor shall agree to remove the person assigned within one calendar day of official notification by the Government and provide a replacement within five calendar days. New hires or substitutions of personnel are subject to the Contractor clearance requirement. All costs associated with obtaining/possessing a background investigation will be borne by the CDFI Fund. The CDFI Fund places a limitation on the number of background TBPDCDF13CI0002

89 of 123

investigations to two additional personnel per year after the initial setup. Additional investigations shall be at the cost of the Contractor. However, if at any time the cleared individual is substituted for other than reasons stated below in this contract, with someone who has not been cleared by the Department of the Treasury, Office of Security Programs (OSP), the cost shall be borne by the Contractor. Background investigations are very costly to the Government. The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for background investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing, shall ensure that otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for as long as needed. The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure that Contractor and/or subcontractor personnel who are selected for assignment to the contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein. The fact that the Government will be responsible for performing background investigations under this contract shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of its responsibility to assure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character. Should a background investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated its responsibilities to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character. Should there be need to replace a Contractor or subcontractor employee due to poor performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated responsibilities to make every effort to select trained, experienced, and reliable employees of reputable background and sound character. Should the Contracting Officer determine that the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to: (a) provide coverage (performance) throughout assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of Contractor personnel would cause either a security threat or Department of the Treasury program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required. Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacements of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time. The Contractor shall consider the unique security concerns present when hiring contract personnel who are not citizens of the United States (U.S.), or who have not resided in the U.S. for at least three of the last five years immediately prior to employment on a Department contract. For investigative purposes, an extended residency outside the U.S. immediately prior to employment on a Department contract may prevent a sufficient background investigation from being conducted. Consequently, without a background investigation, the Contractor employee cannot be granted access to any CDFI Fund data or information.

Disclosure of Information
The Contractor will have access to sensitive data during the execution of this contract. A completed non-disclosure agreement (NDA) shall be required of all Contractor staff assigned to this project. Additionally, all Contractor staff shall adhere to the TTB and CDFI Fund IT TBPDCDF13CI0002

90 of 123

Rules of Behavior. The CDFI Fund reserves the right to require all Contractor staff to undergo background investigations and security clearances, depending on the sensitivity level of the CDFI Fund data being handled. All sensitive CDFI Fund data must be encrypted. All CDFI Fund data must be securely deleted from Contractor staff machines, servers, and devices at the conclusion of the contract. Upon contract award, Contractor staff shall complete a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) provided by the CDFI Fund. Please refer to Appendix 20: AMIS CDFI Fund Sample NonDisclosure Agreement (NDA), Appendix 23: TTB IT Rules of Behavior and Appendix 22: CDFI Fund IT Rules of Behavior.

Confidentiality of Data
All work performed under this contract is confidential and is not to be released to outside parties without express written permission from the CDFI Fund. Confidentiality is essential to satisfactory performance. Due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of data generated by the CDFI Fund, the Contractor shall maintain confidentiality of all documents, data, and other information supplied by the CDFI Fund in accordance with all applicable federal guidelines and regulations. The Contractor shall not disclose any information concerning the work under this contract to any persons or entities unless prior written approval is obtained from the Contracting Officer. Further, in the event of a breach of any of these requirements or restrictions, the Contractor shall provide written notification to the CDFI Fund COR as soon as possible. The Contractor acquires no possessory or proprietary interests in data used in performance of PWS tasks.

Past Performance References
The Government is also seeking information on the Offeror's past performance from organizations for which the work was performed. The Offeror shall forward Appendix 25: AMIS Past Performance Questionnaire to at least three (3) applicable references from the past performance description above, and strongly encourage the references to return the completed forms to the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) on or before the proposal due date. Questionnaires should be emailed to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov or faxed to 304-480-7203 and must contain the subject line "Past Performance Reference for TBPDCDF13CI0002, Attn: SP/GH." The Offeror is responsible for ensuring reference questionnaires are complete and returned on or before the proposal due date. The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel that have relevant experience, or subcontract work performed on major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the acquisition. The Government may contact references other than those identified by the Offeror. Past performance references will also be evaluated for relevance to the requirements of the PWS. (See Evaluation Factor 6 for additional information.)

Submission of the Price Proposal
The Offeror shall submit an electronic copy of its Price Proposal (Volume II) separately.

Volume II: Price Proposal
The Offeror shall also submit an electronic copy of its Price Proposal separately from the Technical Proposal. The Offeror shall submit a firm fixed-price proposal for the majority of the requirements within the PWS. However, the following four discrete tasks shall be priced using labor hours: Task 3.7 CIIS and CIMS Interface Design and Development, Task 3.8 Legacy Data Migration and Conversion, Task 3.9.3 CIIS and CIMS Testing, and Task 3.9.4 Legacy Data Migration/Conversion Testing. As part of its Price Proposal, the Offeror must submit Appendix 26: Pricing Template. Price Proposals shall be broken down in sections that correspond to each task identified in the PWS in accordance with Appendix 26: Pricing Template. Each section shall include a firm fixed-price, or labor-hour pricing for the four discrete tasks referenced above, that indicates the proposed labor categories, applicable labor rates, total number of hours, the price of software and add-on components required to operate the solution, and any applicable other direct costs (ODCs). For licenses costs, the Offeror shall specify whether the licenses are for administrators, regular end users, or other. If the Offeror proposes using subcontractors, the Offeror shall provide the same pricing information for its teaming partners. The Offeror shall discuss its methodology and the basis of its estimate to support how the pricing model was developed. The Offeror shall also list (but not provide pricing for) the hardware required to run the proposed solution, unless it is provided as part of the solution. The Offeror shall indicate clearly those items that are included as part of the core product and those that TTB/CDFI Fund will need to obtain (e.g., server count, processor, RAM, Disk I/O and capacity, etc.) to support the implementation and production of its AMIS solution. Costs associated with required items will be considered when evaluating the Price Proposal, whether provided by the Contractor or the Government.

Travel associated with the required services includes trips to CDFI Fund offices located in Washington, D.C. Local travel is defined as up to 75 miles within the government site and will not be reimbursed. Long-distance travel will be reimbursed in accordance with FAR sub 31.205-46, Travel Costs and the General Services Administration's Federal Travel Regulations (FTR). The Offeror shall not extend costs beyond two (2) decimal points (i.e., $12.19) in Appendix 26: Pricing Template or Appendix 27: Travel Pricing Template. The payment schedule found in Appendix 23: Anticipated Contract Deliverable Payment Schedule outlines the terms of deliverable payments, based on a 24-month deployment. The Offeror may propose an alternate deliverable payment schedule for consideration by the CDFI Fund in its Price Proposal. The payment schedule will be negotiated and finalized prior to contract award. (See Evaluation Factor 7 for additional information.)

Oral Presentations
Offerors determined to be in the competitive range may be invited to conduct an Oral Presentation at the CDFI Fund facility in Washington, DC. The CDFI Fund will use this opportunity to further assess the proposed AMIS solution and the key personnel's experience with the solution and proposed methodology. The CDFI Fund will utilize the presentation to further evaluate strengths, weaknesses, or deficiencies noted during the evaluation of the Technical Proposals if they are addressed during the presentation. As such, the rating of the Technical Proposal may be adjusted based on the Oral Presentation. (See Evaluation Factor 8 for additional information.) The Government will determine each qualified Offeror's presentation time and date. The Contracting Officer will contact Offerors via telephone or email giving the assigned time, date, and location for the presentation. Expenses incurred from the Oral Presentations will be the Offeror's responsibility.

A. Oral Presentation Format
A general timeline for the presentation follows. The presentation shall not last longer than two hours and shall follow these guidelines: - Each Offeror will have a two-hour time limit for an overview of the key personnel, a technical briefing, break, and clarifications. Within this two-hour limit, the Offeror's key personnel shall present its AMIS solution according to the following schedule: 10 minutes ­ Offeror Introduction 70 minutes ­ Product/Solution Demonstration 15 minutes ­ Break 25 minutes ­ Clarifications (as necessary) The presentation shall begin with an overview of the presenter's name, position, and company affiliation. The demonstration of the product will occur next, followed by a 15-minute break. During the break, the CDFI Fund will determine whether it requires clarification. After the break, the Offeror will have 25 minutes to address clarifications,

TBPDCDF13CI0002

if necessary. The Offeror must make the arrangements for scheduling set-up and take-down time outside the 120 minutes.  The Offeror's key personnel should be involved in the Oral Presentation; however, no more than three of the Offeror's key personnel shall be allowed to participate in the Oral Presentation.  The Contracting Officer, or their representative, will tell the Offeror when to start its presentation, keep time, and stop the presentation at the end of the allotted time, whether or not the presentation is complete.  During the Oral Presentation, Offerors may use hard copies of charts, graphics, and/or creative materials, which shall be made available to the Government for review after the presentation. A projection system with a standard computer video adapter will be available upon request. Connection to the Internet will also be available upon request.  Pricing information shall not be included in any part of the presentation.

B. Product Demonstration
During the Oral Presentation, the Offeror's key personnel shall demonstrate: 1. How authorized CDFI Fund staff would configure the product: a. To create and modify a new business rule, specifically to: i. Define program application evaluation criteria, scores, and weights. ii. Establish scoring thresholds, including numerical scores or pass/fail scores, to each program application evaluation criteria. b. To develop, edit, and deploy a workflow, specifically to: i. Assign a single or a batch of applications to a team of reviewers. ii. Remove a reviewer from a team of reviewers. iii. Manually re-assign application evaluations to reviewers to resolve any resource overload or conflict that may arise. 2. Communications between CDFI Fund staff and external users, specifically: a. How an internal user (i.e., CDFI Fund staff) would correspond with an applicant, e.g., to request additional information for an application. b. How an external user (e.g., awardee) would correspond with CDFI Fund staff, e.g., to ask a question on compliance reporting. 3. How an internal user (i.e., CDFI Fund staff) would access and use real-time system data to formulate a query using mathematical and/or statistical calculations to produce a report, e.g., determine if an awardee is compliant with the Operating Liquidity Ratio, calculated by dividing cash and cash equivalents by .25 of total expenses. Compliance is defined as having an operating liquidity ratio of 1 or greater. 4. How the system identifies/flags awardees as non-compliant based on a business rule (i.e., comparing awardee report data received against award/awardee parameters and rules). 5. Functions for external users, specifically: a. Create an account profile and establish affiliated relationships (e.g., using Employer Identification Numbers (EINs), linking subsidiary CDEs to institutions, certifications, etc.).

TREASURY AB # 12-01 REPRESENTATION BY CORPORATIONS REGARDING AN UNPAID DELINQUENT TAX LIABILITY OR A FELONY CONVICTION UNDER FEDERAL LAW (FEB 2012)
(1) The Offeror does [ ] does not [ ] have any unpaid federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability. (2) The Offeror, its officers or agents acting on its behalf have [ ] have not [ ] been convicted of a felony criminal violation under any federal law within the preceding 24 months.

52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS
Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

OVERVIEW OF THE SOURCE SELECTION PROCESS
The CDFI Fund will select the Offeror based upon evaluation of the submitted Qualifying Documents and if the Qualifying Documents are compliant, the Technical Proposal, and Price Proposal. The Government will review each document individually for compliance with the solicitation, focusing on the evaluation factors as shown below, as the PWS directs. Following this initial review, the Government will review the responses to the three Go/No-Go Evaluation Factors in the submitted Qualifying Documents. Proposals that meet all three Go/No-Go Evaluation factors will be considered compliant and will continue to the next phase. Proposals that fail to meet one or more of the Go/No-Go Evaluation Factors will be considered non-compliant and will not be reviewed further or given further consideration.

GENERAL EVALUATION AND AWARD CONSIDERATIONS
Offerors shall submit the Qualifying Documents, and Technical and Price Proposals in accordance with the Instructions to Offerors. The Government may reject the Offeror's proposal if the Contracting Officer determines the proposal does not materially comply with the Instructions to Offerors. Since the Government may establish this contract, in part, based upon the information submitted in the initial offers without further discussions, the Offeror shall submit its initial offer with the most favorable price and technical terms. The evaluation factors below represent the key areas of importance and emphasis that the Government will consider in its source selection decision, and support meaningful comparison and discrimination between competing proposals.

BASIS FOR AWARD

TBPDCDF13CI0002

103 of 123

Under this solicitation, the Government intends to make a single award for the implementation of commercially-available off-the-shelf (COTS), government off-the-shelf (GOTS), or a single software architecture Enterprise Application Software (e.g., customer relationship management (CRM) software, business process management (BPM) software, enterprise content management (ECM) software, etc.) product that can be configured to meet the CDFI Fund's awards management requirements. The Government will make an award to the responsible Offeror, whose solution and proposal represent the best value to the CDFI Fund, based on compliance with the CDFI Fund's AMIS requirements, evaluation factors, overall price, and the degree of risk in implementation and meeting the Government's requirements. The evaluation of the proposal will assess the Offeror's ability to achieve the requirements as stated in Section 2 ­ Objectives and Section 3 ­ Scope for the base period and option years. The Government reserves the right to award the contract to an Offeror other than that Offeror with the lowest price or with the highest merit rating. For this requirement, the Government is more concerned with obtaining technical capability than making an award at the lowest price. The importance of cost/price may increase as the difference in technical proposals decreases. For this contract, the Government will award to the Offeror whose proposal represents the best overall value to the Government, considering Technical Capability/Approach; Past Performance; Oral Presentation; Management Approach, Staffing Plan, and Quality Control; and Price. When evaluated, as technical scores become more even among competing proposals, price carries a greater weight in the best value analysis. The Government is not obligated to award to the highest technical proposal or the lowest price proposal. The selection will be made based on the proposal having the best overall value to the Government.

Evaluation Factors and Sub-Factors
Phase 1 ­ Go/No-Go Evaluation Factor 1 ­ Workflow Engine to Facilitate Business Processes

The Quality Control Plan describes the method for identifying and preventing problems before the level of performance becomes unacceptable.

3. Past Performance Evaluation Factor Factor 6 ­ Past Performance
The Offeror will be evaluated on past experience in implementing projects of similar complexity and scope. If the Offeror is teaming with another company, it is preferable for the team to have worked together previously on a similar project. Past experience for existing and prior contracts must be relevant to grants and/or awards management products and services. Past Performance includes the descriptions of two (2) relevant task orders/contracts awarded for similar services submitted by the Offeror, as well as at least three (3) TBPDCDF13CI0002

107 of 123

past performance references received in response to the Past Performance Questionnaire. Both sources of input will be evaluated based upon the extent to which:

a. The Offeror's past performance demonstrates the use of a robust business
rules engine to successfully manage complex business rules and algorithms to meet the unique requirements of previous clients. b. The Offeror's past experience demonstrates that it has configured its solution to successfully meet the unique requirements of previous clients. c. The Offeror's past experience demonstrates data migration, including the variety, type, and complexity of legacy data and how it was incorporated during previous implementations. With the approval of the Contracting Officer, references other than those identified by the Offeror may be contacted by the Government, with the information received to be used in the evaluation of the Offeror's past performance.

Phase 3 ­ Price Proposal Evaluation Factor 7 ­ Price
The Government will review and evaluate each compliant Offeror's Price Proposal for reasonableness and to determine whether or not it is commensurate with the Offeror's proposed solution, including:

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.
