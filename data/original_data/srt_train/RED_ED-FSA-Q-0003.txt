CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


                                          Additional Terms and Conditions of the Resulting Award Clauses


  52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)

  The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may
be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised
more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by
written notice to the Contractor within fifteen (15) days before contract expiration.


  FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)

  (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within One Day of contract expiration provided that
the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The
preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.
  (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.
  (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 36 months.


1. Federal Student Aid Clauses
307-17a Conflict of Interest Certification
   (A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of their knowledge
   and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR
   Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that
   the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to
   exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor,
   subcontractor, employee or consultant).  Conflicts may arise in the following situations:




   1. Unequal access to information – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through
   its performance on a government contract.

   2. Biased ground rules – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on
   the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract,

   3. Impaired objectivity – a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent
   or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of
   government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to
   recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility.

   "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the
   relevant facts to question a person's objectivity:
       - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be
       purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the
       Department;
       - significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property
       or services; or
       - significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific
       curriculum, specific products, property or services.
Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest)
regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity.
In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions
to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when
appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the
work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict.  In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of
interest.
(B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest
(or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.
This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the
Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest).
 (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid
the appearance of a conflict of interest.  If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an
actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government
may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.  These remedies include
imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S.
Code, Section 3802.  Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.  The Contractor may also be
required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest.  An example of

currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or

conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its
ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage.
In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest.  The Offeror further certifies that it has and
will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such Conflict of Interest
(or apparent conflict of interest).
