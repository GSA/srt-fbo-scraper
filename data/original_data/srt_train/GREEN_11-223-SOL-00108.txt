                       Glossary

Aggregated data – High-level summary data on groups that is composed of a collection of other more individual data

Commercially available – The data resource, or access to it, is available for sale or has been sold to the general public as of January, 2009
(Note: The FDA does not intend to use this solicitation to initiate or complete development of a resource.)

Currently existing – The data chosen for this award must be a commercially available product at the time of the proposal.  The FDA does not
intend to use this solicitation to initiate or complete development of a resource.

Data dictionary – A document that describes the information available in the data resource.  This information shall minimally include field or
variable name, description, definition (including business rules for computed fields and missing data), allowed values, and percentage of
discharges or patients in the data resource where it is present.  All fields or variables in the data resource shall be included in this
document.

 De-Identified data – Data that has had key patient information removed, e.g., name, address, social security number, and date of birth, so that
any user or audience shall not purposefully or inadvertently discover a patient’s identity.  However, the capability of tracking a single
individual (e.g. patient A) across multiple encounters over time and of differentiating that individual from another individual (e.g. patient B)
shall be required.

Demographic – The age and gender of the patient shall be required. Information on race/ethnicity shall be included if available, accompanied by
documentation of the origin of this data.

Desktop – Authorized FDA personnel shall be able to access the data from their own FDA issued computers (i.e., no special or customized hardware
shall be required for access)

Direct – Authorized FDA personnel shall be able to access raw or sample numbers from the data source from their desktop (i.e., no intervention
on the contractors part shall be necessary.  In addition, output that consists of formatted reports only will not be acceptable).

Disclosure policy – The process of providing FDA written authorization to disclose information from this resource in public forums or sharing
with third parties on collaborative projects initiated by FDA for public health safety and regulatory purposes.  This process shall ensure that
the information or data disclosed is accurate and does not violate any of the Offeror’s existing agreements.

Firewall-to-firewall virtual private network (VPN) – A Secure TCP/IP connection made between two firewalls that simulate a local area network.
Encryption/decryption and authentication are mandatory for the VPN solution.

Full disclosure of data collection– The FDA shall receive detailed information on how the sample is selected, how data are obtained and
cleaned/edited for analysis, how the data was built how variables are defined, and the relationship between variables within the data structure.


Immediate – Authorized FDA personnel shall be able to access the data whenever needed.

Multi-user environment – Two or more authorized FDA users shall be able to access the data at the same time from different locations.


Outpatient – Any place where health care is received without being admitted to the hospital as an inpatient. (NB: Day surgery, ambulatory care
centers, and other outpatient services provided by hospitals may be considered to be within the outpatient setting.)

Projection or other appropriate methodologies – Projection methodology is an algorithm that can be used to reliably and accurately estimate drug
utilization for the U.S. population using the sample captured in the data.  Other appropriate methodologies may include, but are not limited to,
gathering drug utilization data on the universe of OTC product sales and use (e.g., a “census” method), which may reduce or eliminate the need
for projection.  Should a “census” method be chosen, the Offeror shall provide mutually acceptable evidence that the data are adequately
representative of outpatient drug utilization in the U.S.

Raw data- Data in the form obtained from the data access tool which is not further summarized or processed.

Real-time – Real-time access refers to doing something while people are watching or waiting. FDA expects the Contractor to provide information
on how readily available access to their data will be.

Reliable – The projection method used must yield the same or similar results in the same or similar situations (e.g., must be reproducible and
repeatable)

Robust – in cases where the assumptions underlying the projection or other appropriate methodology are not all met, the results obtained should
be the same as in similar situations where all assumptions and conditions are fully met.

Secure – At no time will passwords, login, or data be open to inspection or intrusion by unauthorized parties.

Unlimited – authorized FDA personnel shall have the ability to use any data element in the database in any combination or query that is
necessary to address a specific issue

Valid – an assessment of how well the projected values reflect what is actually happening in the entire population of interest.

                                                              Section 508 Standards




Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 (29 U.S.C. § 794 (d) was enacted in the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. Section 508
requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with
disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not
individuals with disabilities. The Act required the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (Access Board) to create federal
standards for electronic and information technology (EIT) products (goods and services) to make them more accessible by individuals with
disabilities.

Each Offeror will be evaluated on their conformance to the Section 508 Standards identified below as being applicable for this requirement. The
conformance to these standards will be evaluated as follows:

   1. Conformance at proposal submission


   2. Conformance by scheduled delivery date, after insignificant or no contractor development


   3. Conformance by scheduled delivery date, after significant contractor development

No allowance is given here for partial performance as gradations are difficult to verify and add complexity.

Using the following web site, Offerors can access resources for understanding and implementing the requirements of Section 508

                                                       DATA DISCLOSURE CLEARANCE PROCEDURES




PURPOSE:

As provided for at FAR 52.227-14 (Alt II), [Name of Contractor] (“Contractor”) has provided a Limited Rights Notice to FDA (Attachments 2)
identifying Limited Rights Data (see definition below).  This Limited Rights Notice authorizes FDA to disclose these Limited Rights Data for
public health, safety, and regulatory purposes, provided that the disclosures of these data are made subject to prohibition against their
further disclosure.

In accordance with the Limited Rights Notice, the purpose of this document is to establish timely clearance procedures for the FDA and
Contractor to follow when FDA seeks either (1) to make Aggregated Limited Rights Data (see definition below) publicly available, or (2) to
disclose actual Limited Rights Data to specific third parties subject to prohibition against their further disclosure.

DEFINITIONS:

Aggregated Limited Rights Data -- Any collective or summary presentation of Limited Rights Data that does not disclose any raw data accessed by
FDA from [Name of Contractor] (Contractor) [Database System].

De-identified Data – Data that have had patient, hospital, and physician information removed, e.g., names, addresses, social security numbers,
and dates of birth, so that any user or audience cannot purposefully or inadvertently discover a patient’s identity.

Limited Rights Data – For purposes of these data disclosure clearance procedures, the definition of Limited Rights Data provided at FAR 52.227-
14 is understood to include raw data, accessed by FDA personnel through the [Database Systems].

Public Release – Any communications, meetings, or interactions where FDA personnel  make information publicly available, including by disclosing
it: to any private, public, or governmental entity other than in accordance with paragraph 5 of these procedures; at any public event, such as
the public portion of an advisory committee meeting or a public presentation or demonstration; through any publication in any media, such as
scientific and technical articles; or in any agency record that FDA makes available on a non-confidential basis to anyone outside FDA, including
in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.

PROCEDURES:

 These clearance procedures do not apply to disclosure of information, including of Limited Rights Data and/or Aggregated Limited Rights Data,
made in response to an authorized request of Congress or any other government body of competent jurisdiction (see [section of primary agreement
in which such disclosures are discussed]  [Database System]  (“Agreement”).

1. FDA and Contractor shall complete the Clearance Procedure Cover Sheet (Attachment 2 is a blank copy) upon execution of the Agreement.  This
   form provides the names and contact information for individuals who shall serve as the primary contact (Contact) for each party.  Each party
   must update the Cover Sheet any time any of its contact information or its Contact changes.
2. For each proposed disclosure, FDA shall submit a Clearance Request Form (Attachment 2 is a blank copy), a copy of the materials to be
   disclosed, and a copy of the source data files cited in those materials.

3. FDA shall identify Contractor as the data source when disclosing Aggregated Limited Rights Data or Limited Rights Data.


4. Within 24 hours of receipt by the Contractor's Contact of the Clearance Request Form, Contractor shall provide a clearance decision for the
   requested Public Release of Aggregated Limited Rights Data.

5. Disclosure approval applies to the life of the materials as approved.  FDA shall notify the contractor of further release, at the
   contractor’s request.

6. Within 48 hours of receipt by the Contractor's Contact of the Clearance Request Form, the Contractor shall provide a clearance decision for
   disclosure of Limited Rights Data to a third party in accordance with the following conditions:

     a. The third party must be actively engaged in a project initiated by FDA;
     b. Clearance to share the data with the third party shall be granted only for purposes of the FDA initiated project and shall not extend
        beyond the duration of the third party's active engagement in that project;
     c. The third party must execute in a timely manner the required Contractor Third Party Access agreement and agree in writing to return any
        copies of the data provided to, or made by, that party when the third party is no longer actively engaged in such project or at such
        earlier time as FDA may request in writing; and
     d. The third party must agree in writing not to release the Limited Rights Data to any additional party.

7. If a third party that received Limited Rights Data in accordance with paragraph 5 seeks to disclose materials that include Aggregated Limited
   Rights Data, the third party must submit an electronic copy of those materials and of the source data files relied upon to FDA for submission
   to Contractor for clearance approval.


8. Clearance to use Limited Rights Data and/or Aggregated Limited Rights Data does not grant any third party rights to use the (Name of
   Contractor) (Contractor) [Database Systems] software tools.

 TERM:This policy shall be in effect for the calendar year for the length of the contract and thereafter until either party notifies the other of
                                      its termination or Contractor provides to the FDA a different policy.
                                                                   Attachment 6

                                        Note on obtaining copies of proprietary software from contractors

If FDA may wish to receive from a data provider copies of associated proprietary software that was not developed with FDA funds:*

   (1) In addition to cross-referencing FAR 52.227-14, the data access agreement should--

        a. cross-reference FAR 52.227-14 Alt. III (1987) regarding access to "restricted computer software"; and


        b. include the following statement, explaining that such software constitutes "restricted computer software" for purposes of the
           agreement:

           Restricted Computer Software -- For purposes of [Agreement], the definition of Restricted Computer Software provided at FAR 52.227-14
           is understood to include any proprietary computer software the development of which FDA did not fund.

   (2) The Contractor should provide a Restricted Rights Notice to FDA with the software as provided for at FAR 52.227-14 Alt. III (1987). The
      content of the notice can be specified in the agreement. Contact legal counsel if the parties wish to use language in the notice that is
      different from the model language provided at FAR 52.227-14 Alt. III (1987).


      *If FDA paid for development of the software, the software would not be "restricted computer software" and these special provisions and
      procedures would not apply.




                                                                   Attachment 7

                                           Exchanging Certificates with the External Individual and FDA

                                                        FDA Secure Electronic Mail System

1. The external user must obtain his or her own certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA) like Digital Signature Trust Co., Thawte
   Consulting, (Pty) Ltd., or VeriSign, Inc.  (Instructions on how to obtain certificates are located at the end of this document.)


2. After he or she has obtained a commercial grade U.S. Domestic 1024-bit key certificate, the user will need to send a signed message to the
   address cert-query@fda.hhs.gov.  The message must have a subject of Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov.  The body of the E-mail may be blank because
   the certificate exchange process ignores it.


   By digitally signing this message, the user is providing his or her certificate to the Tumbleweed E-mail Firewall (EMF) system.  The address
   in the “To” field directs the message to an auto-responder built into the Tumbleweed EMF system.  EMF responds to the cert-query@fda.hhs.gov
   by returning the proxy certificate of the person specified in the “Subject” field, according to the alias name or username. Initially all
   secure testing is completed with Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov. However, all external users will need to complete these same steps with each
   person they need to correspond with at FDA to enable secure e-mail communications. Please make sure that you use the
   firstname.lastname@fda.hhs.gov ONLY.


A. The external user should simply double-click on Tumbleweed EMF’s certificate.  This will open the “Certificate” window.  Click on the
   “Details” tab to view this certificate’s details.


B. Click the “Install Certificate...” button at the bottom of this window’s “General” tab.  This will begin the Certificate Manager Import
   Window.  Click the “Next” button to continue.


C. Choose to “Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate” when prompted.


D. Click the “Finish” button to complete the wizard.  A warning will appear, asking if you want to add the certificate to the root store.  Click
   “Yes” to add it.  A message saying that the certificate has been added should appear.  Close the “Certificate” window by clicking “OK.”


1. By this time, the external user should have gotten a response to his or her certificate query.  The query response should appear to have come
   from the user that was queried.  In Outlook, a reddish ribbon and a blue lock will appear on the e-mail message showing that the message has
   been digitally signed and contains the sender’s certificate.  The user should right-click on the “From” address to add this sender (and his or
   her certificate) to the contacts list.  The external user should make sure to EXPLICITLY TRUST the certificate. This is a very important
   PROCEDURE.  If this step is not completed, any message sent to this user will not be readable.


2. Now that the certificate exchange has been done, the external user must e-mail the Tumbleweed EMF administrator-- so he or she can verify the
   external user’s certificate. The address is Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov. At this point the external user should be sending a SIGNED AND
   ENCRYPTED message.


3. Now that both the Tumbleweed EMF root certificate and the external user’s certificate have been exchanged and verified, the external user and
   the EMF administrator (through the Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov account) will VERIFY that the exchange test messages are being signed/encrypted
   and decrypted/verified.


   When sending E-mail to Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov, the external user must click on the “To...” button and choose Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov from
   the contacts list.  Outlook will not associate Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov proxy certificate with the E-mail if the external user just types
   Lawrence.Lake@fda.hhs.gov address in the “To...” field.  E-mail addressed by typing the address in will not go out encrypted.  (A “Non-Secure
   Recipients” alert will be displayed.)


A. For the external user to view his or her certificate, he or she must select “Options...” from the Tools menu of Outlook main window.  He or
   she will have to view the “Security” tab under the Options window.  Finally, he or she will click the button labeled “Encrypted e-mail...” in
   this section the external user will need to select either “add digital signature or encrypt contents and attachments or both.”


B. [pic]


C. A new window titled “Change Security Settings” will appear.  A section called “Digital Signature” will be a little more than halfway down the
   window.  In this section is a button labeled “Choose...”  The external user will have to click on this button to bring up a list of his or her
   certificates.  (Note:  there is another section called “Encryption.”  This should contain the same certificate that the “Digital Signature”
   section has.)


D. In the new window, the external user must choose the certificate he or she is working with by double-clicking it.  This opens the
   “Certificate” window.  The certificate’s thumbprint is under the “Details” tab.  (Note:  Microsoft products display the thumb/fingerprint
   using the SHA1 algorithm while EMF uses the MD5 algorithm.  The external user should explicitly state to the EMF administrator that the
   thumb/fingerprint being read is from SHA1.)


How OUTLOOK Users Obtain Certificates


External users of S/MIME clients must obtain a certificate from a CA and import it into their E-mail client.  This client must be configured for
commercial grade 3DES encryption when communicating with FDA/HHS, as that is a specification mandated by FIPS 140-1.  Although a certificate may
be obtained from any CA, these instructions show how to acquire one from VeriSign, Inc. and import it into Outlook with Internet Explorer.


1. Open the Outlook client program.


2. Pull down the “Tools” menu and select “Options.”


3. Click on the “Security” tab in the “Options window.”


4. Select “Get a Digital ID.”  This will automatically load VeriSign’s web page.


5. From VeriSign’s web page, select “Class 1 Digital ID.”


6. Fill out the form with payment information.  Press the “Submit” button.


7. E-mail from VeriSign Inc. should shortly arrive.  This E-mail has embedded hypertext markup language so that it looks like a web page.  Links
   in this E-mail will lead one through the final steps in importing the certificate.

Please refer to FAR Part 19.7 for instruction concerning the submission of a Commercial Plan:  SSR is due on 10/30 each year for the previous
fiscal year ending 9/30.

     a. Submit ISR (bi-annually) for the awarding Contracting Officer’s review and acceptance via the eSRS website.


     b.   Currently, SSR (annually) must be submitted for the HHS eSRS Agency Coordinator review and acceptance via the eSRS website.  (Note:
         Log onto the OSDBU website to view the HHS Agency Coordinator contact information
         (http://www.hhs.gov/about/smallbusiness/osdbustaff.html).


Note:  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will indicate whether a subcontracting plan is required.  Due to the nature and complexity of many HHS
contracts, particularly the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), the contractor may not be required to submit its subcontracting reports
through the eSRS.   The Contracting Officer will confirm reporting requirements prior to the issuance of an award.  For more information,
contact Teneshia Alston, Agency Coordinator-eSRS (Teneshia.Alston@HHS.GOV).

7.  Record keeping

FAR 19.704(a) (11) requires a list of the types of records your company will maintain to demonstrate the procedures adopted to comply with the
requirements and goals in the subcontracting plan.  The following is a recitation of the types of records the contractor will maintain to
demonstrate the procedures adopted to comply with the requirements and goals in the subcontracting plan.  These records will include, but not be
limited to, the following:

     a. SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB source lists, guides and other data identifying such vendors;

     b. Organizations contacted in an attempt to locate SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB sources;

     c. On a contract-by-contract basis, records on all subcontract solicitations over $100,000, which indicate for each solicitation (1)
        whether SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and/or SDVOSB concerns were solicited, if not, why not and the reasons solicited concerns did not
        receive subcontract awards;


     d. Records to support other outreach efforts, e.g., contacts with minority and small business trade associations, attendance at small and
        minority business procurement conferences and trade fairs;

     e. Records to support internal guidance and encouragement provided to buyers through (1) workshops, seminars, training programs, incentive
        awards; and (2) monitoring performance to evaluate compliance with the program and requirements; and

     f. On a contract-by-contract basis, records to support subcontract award data including the name, address, and business type and size of
        each subcontractor. (This is not required on a contract–by–contract basis for commercial plans.)
     g. Other records to support your compliance with the subcontracting plan: (Please describe)
        _____________________________________________________________


        _____________________________________________________________


        _____________________________________________________________


8.  Timely Payments to Subcontractors

FAR 19.702 requires your company to establish and use procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of your
subcontracts with SB concerns, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB concerns.

Your company has established and used such procedures:  ________ yes _________ no


9.  Description of Good Faith Effort

Maximum practicable utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of
national interest with both social and economic benefits.  When a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting
plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.  In order
to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB small business subcontracting
goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with the contracting official prior to approval of the
plan.

Part 3 – Description/Specifications/Work Statement

3.1   Background

A vital part of FDA and CDER’s mission is to protect the public health.  The mission of the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE) is to
evaluate drug risks and promote the safe use of drugs, prescription and over-the-counter (OTC), by the American people.  The statutory
provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA, Section 406),
Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to ensure the safety
and effectiveness of regulated marketed products.

In early 2005, FDA commissioned the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct a study to examine the US drug safety system.  In September 2006, the
Institute of Medicine Report entitled, “The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public” was released and outlined
numerous ongoing and future activities designed to continue to strengthen the FDA’s drug safety program.  The Office of Surveillance and
Epidemiology (OSE) contributes to this effort by evaluating drug risks and promoting the safe use of drugs by the American people.  Specific
recommendations in the IOM report addressed modernizing the drug safety program including activities for the expansion of database resources.

In addition, Title IX of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA 2007) contains numerous provisions related to post-
marketing safety and communication of safety information.  A subset of those provisions calls for enhanced authorities for accessing disparate
data sources, establish and improve procedures to identify drug use data trends on a national level for prescription as well as OTC drugs in the
outpatient setting.

The ability of FDA to respond expeditiously to the increasing number of drug safety issues is of paramount importance to the overall public
safety.  Access to OTC drug product use will complement and strengthen the utility of FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) currently in
place.  Access to these data will also increase the FDA’s ability to perform regulatory impact studies; in particular, those studies that assess
the impact of prescription to OTC switches.  Finally, direct access to these data in real-time enhances and accelerates the pace of FDA's
regulatory decision-making process.  The funding of "Access to Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drug Utilization Data" would serve as a mechanism for FDA
to respond expeditiously to serious public health or regulatory issues related to OTC drug products.

FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as the means to access the
data.

FDA's authority to fund research projects is set out in section 301 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA 42 U.S.C. 241).

3.2   Program Research Goals and Objectives:

The Contractor shall provide FDA personnel with direct access to a currently existing, commercially available data resource for Over-the-Counter
drug utilization data that includes household demographics, drug treatment patterns, and indications or ailments intended for treatment in the
outpatient setting using surveys and/or other methodologies. This data resource shall have the capability of providing national patterns of OTC
drug use patterns in the outpatient setting through the use of projection or other appropriate methodologies that are scientifically sound and
transparent to FDA personnel.


3.3   Scope of Work

The contractor shall provide the required personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things required for or incident to
the performance of the work as described below:



Database Requirements - Unlimited Access to OTC Drug Utilization Data; Projection or Other Appropriate Methodology, and Current and Complete
Data Dictionary

The Contractor shall provide continuous access to a de-identified HIPAA-compliant data resource on OTC drug product usage including, household
demographics, drug treatment patterns, and indications or ailments intended for treatment in the outpatient setting throughout the length of the
