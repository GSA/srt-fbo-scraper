           (1) ___ are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by

           (2) ___ have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
           against them for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a
           Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the
           submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false
           statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and


           (3) ___ are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission
           of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

           amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.


                 (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:


                       (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is
                       not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to
                       the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.


                       (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax
                       liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action
                       is precluded.


                 (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the
                 taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax
                 liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
                 all judicial appeal rights.


                       (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been
                       issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals
                       contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In
                       the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had
                       no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent  tax because it is not a final tax liability.
                       Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all
                       judicial appeal rights.


                       (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely
                       payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not
                       currently required to make full payment.


                       (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is
                       stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


      (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in
      paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
      Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)


           (1) Listed end products.

Listed End Product          Listed Countries of Origin
[ ]                         [ ]


           (2) Certification. (If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this
           provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.)

                 ___ (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or
                 manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.


                 ___ (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or
                 manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort
                 to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished
                 under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.


      (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
      statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects  to provide in
      response to this solicitation is predominantly--


           (1) ___ In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States
           exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or


           (2) ___ Outside the United States.


      (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance
      with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt
      services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)


           [ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ___ does ___ does
           not certify that--


                 (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are
                 sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general
                 public in the course of normal business operations;


                 (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
                 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and


                 (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the
                 same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.


           [ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror ___ does ___ does not certify that--


                 (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the
                 offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of
                 normal business operations;


                 (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR
                 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));


                 (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time
                 (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available
                 hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract;  and

                 (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a
                 Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as

           Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment--Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to
           this offeror; and


           (2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible, if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
           Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation.


      (d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of
      this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.
