C.1.0 INTRODUCTION C.1.1 FDA CENTER FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products (the Center) was established by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), a bipartisan bill signed into law by President Obama on June 22, 2009. The Tobacco Control Act grants FDA the authority to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products. With the relative newness of the Tobacco Control Act, regulatory information may be released that affects the public education campaigns of the Center and may result in the need to adjust strategy, messaging, and creative development and execution. The Center's goal is to use the best available science to develop and put into action effective public health strategies to reduce the enormous toll of illness and death caused by tobacco products. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tobacco use causes more than 400,000 deaths each year in the United States--about 1 out of every 5 deaths. On average, adults who smoke cigarettes die 14 years earlier than nonsmokers. And, more than 8.5 million Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking. Despite those facts, 1 in 4 high school students report current tobacco use. About 3,450 youth start smoking and 850 become regular smokers every day. The Center has responsibility for the implementation of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, H.R. 1256. The Center's Web site is http://www.fda.gov/tobacco .

C.1.2 OFFICE OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION The Office of Health Communication and Education (the Office) is a comprehensive communication enterprise that supports the priorities of the Center, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and its partners. The Office is the central point of communication and education about the Center's regulatory activity and tobacco prevention and control efforts. The Office develops and leads public health education campaigns that educate a variety of audiences about FDA tobacco product regulations and their intent to improve public health, coordinates cross-Center communication activities, ensures consistent branding and messaging, offers communication expertise and state-of-the-art digital tools for application across Center projects, and builds and maintains effective relationships with partners and stakeholders. As the communication component of the Center's effort to reduce the suffering caused by tobacco products and to protect youth from tobacco, the Office seeks to:

1. Prevent tobacco use among young people in the United States; and 2. Encourage those who use tobacco to quit.
The Office will accomplish these goals by integrating public education messages across traditional platforms and using new media, paid media, partnership, and community-level strategies to achieve the desired effect on intended audiences. An important aspect of campaign

8

11-223-SOL-00102
communication efforts will be the use of innovative and emerging digital technologies, including mobile, to reach young and multicultural audiences. In addition to traditional paid and new media, the campaigns will include community outreach to localize and amplify messages in ways that resonate with intended audiences. Campaign activities will likely include, but are not limited to, development of integrated advertising, social and earned media, Web sites and content; the holding of news media events or other local and regional events; the development of partnerships with corporations, state and local agencies, federal partners, and nongovernmental organizations; working with community-level groups and coalitions; and outreach to the entertainment industry. C.2.0 SCOPE The purpose of this contract is to provide the FDA Center for Tobacco Products with a mechanism to assist in a full range of activities associated with planning, developing, producing, and delivering consumer-based communication programs, strategies, and materials for multiple, national, multichannel public health education campaigns. The Contractor shall provide comprehensive campaign services for multiple national, large-scale public education campaigns targeting audiences of up to 40 million people to include, but not limited to financing and placing media buys in excess of $15 million. The Contractor's management responsibilities shall include all activities necessary to ensure the accomplishment of timely and effective support, performed in accordance with the requirements contained in the Task Order. Specifically, the Contractor shall be responsible for the development and execution of comprehensive public education campaigns with diverse intended audiences that enables the Office to meet public health objectives developed by the Office and the Outcome Evaluation Contractor. C.2.1 OBJECTIVES As stated in section 1.2, the Office objectives are to:

1. Prevent tobacco use among young people in the United States; and 2. Encourage those who use tobacco to quit
The Contractor shall work with the Office to develop specific measures for the communication objectives appropriate to the Task Order. C.2.2 CAMPAIGN MANAGEMENT AND STAFFING The Contractor is responsible for the overall management and coordination of strategic and creative development for advertising, new media, paid media, social media, earned media, partnership, and community-level strategies. As such, the Contractor must ensure integration of all campaign elements. In the performance of a task under this contract, Contractors may need to communicate with other contractors performing similar work in support of the Center for Tobacco Products. This may include participation in milestone meetings, strategy sessions, or discussions concerning the work product of one contractor being provided to another as government furnished property. Contractors are advised that any direction must come from the COR. The Contractor is responsible for the development and ongoing refinement of campaign strategies as directed by the Office, those working in communications and tobacco control fields, and other subject matter experts in related fields.

11-223-SOL-00102

Task Orders issued will require dedicated account management staff of exceptional breadth and depth­with expertise in developing complex advertising campaigns, formative research, strategic planning, paid and earned media, emerging technologies, public information, and ability to localize national and regional campaigns, as well as a firm understanding of health communication, with specific knowledge of tobacco control being preferred. The Contractor shall also be capable of providing both management and strategic campaign guidance, which may include briefings to expert panels, nongovernment organizations, and other entities. C.2.3 MAJOR AREAS OF FOCUS C.2.3.1 PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS The Tobacco Control Act provides the FDA with the authority to address the use of tobacco by young people and dependence on tobacco (21 USC 387 note). The Office is responsible for planning, implementing, and evaluating strategic public education campaigns for the Center that prevent tobacco use among young people in the United States and encourage those who use tobacco to quit. About 3,450 youth start smoking and 850 become regular smokers every day and 1 in 4 high school students report current tobacco use. A significant portion of public education campaign activities will focus on preventing the use of tobacco by teenagers. In addition to preteens and teenagers as intended audiences, tobacco retailers and teen influencers will also be the focus of youth tobacco prevention campaign activities. Public education campaigns will also be developed and implemented to encourage those who use tobacco to quit. Tobacco use causes more than 400,000 deaths each year in the United States-- about 1 out of every 5 deaths. A primary strategy to achieve this objective is to raise awareness and understanding of the public health basis for FDA tobacco regulations. FDA regulations prohibiting of the manufacture of cigarettes labeled as light, mild, or low or a similar descriptor and regulations requiring new and more visible warning labels on cigarette and smokeless tobacco products present an opportunity to educate tobacco users about the public health basis of the regulations and encourage them to quit. The Center anticipates that overall strategies for campaigns will include national media buys and an emphasis on new and social media and partner outreach. C.2.3.2 SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE Contractor teams proposed shall consist of individuals who have a proven understanding of the core subject matter and the key audiences of the public education campaigns. Contractor staff shall demonstrate in-depth knowledge and expertise in the area of tobacco control and/or health communication. The contractor shall have the ability to track and analyze related scientific literature. The capacity to take complex science-based information and convey it in the most understandable and salient way to key audiences, such as teens and their influencers, tobacco retailers, those who use tobacco, and communication intermediaries, such as partners and community-based groups, is critical.

10

11-223-SOL-00102

The Contractor shall engage professional experts in each subject matter area, convene expert panels/advisory groups for the purpose of contributing new information and insights, and work closely with other government and non-government organizations, as directed by the Center, with which the Office may rely upon for additional expertise. C.2.3.3 STRATEGIC CAMPAIGN PLANNING The Contractor shall support the Office's public education campaigns by providing comprehensive health communication planning, including (1) identifying goals and measurable objectives, (2) defining and researching targeted audiences, (3) exploring settings, channels, and activities to effectively reach targeted audiences, (4) identifying potential partners and develop partnership plans, (5) developing communication strategies and branding opportunities, and (6) drafting marketing plans. The Contractor shall develop a marketing plan that contains the rationale for executing the Public Education Campaign, measurable objectives, audience information, message and materials testing plans, strategy development, tactics, evaluation plan, timetables, and work plans. Detailed marketing plans should be based on research and reflect the latest science and trends in tobacco control, health communications, dissemination, and outreach; and provide innovative and comprehensive strategies. Whenever possible, plan tactics should include activities that are integrated across FDA and HHS. Plans should include strategies and tactics that are actionable and measurable. Detailed marketing plans and creative strategy shall include opportunities for media buys, purchased by the contractor on behalf of the government, to ensure appropriate exposure of intended audiences to campaign messages and content. Media buy plans should include the specific media properties and markets proposed, schedules, costs, and other relevant details. In crafting plans, the Contractor shall take into consideration the growth of mobile technology and social media in American society and recommend opportunities in digital communication with the potential to reach intended audiences with health messages and educational information more effectively and efficiently than traditional media buys. When ˇ ˇ ˇ developing strategic campaign plans, the contractor shall also prepare: supplementary materials, such as environmental scans, situation analyses, etc.; a slide presentation summarizing the plan; a review and summary of formative campaign research and relevant tobacco control and health communication research.

C.2.3.4 CREATIVE CAMPAIGN & CONTENT DEVELOPMENT The Contractor shall be responsible for all creative campaign and content development. Advertisements.

This will include (1) conducting environmental scans to inventory related health communications campaigns outside of the Center; (2) using audience research to draft message concepts; and (3) pretesting the concepts with intended audiences to understand which messages are most effective, identifying any potential problems, and uncovering new concepts. Message concept testing will ideally be conducted through focus groups or in-depth interviews, but the contractor may suggest other alternative or innovative methods that provide increased transparency and/or cost-efficiencies. The Contractor shall use the results of the message concept testing and the overall plan to develop preproduction draft materials to test with intended audiences to ensure accuracy, consistency, clarity, relevance, credibility, and appeal. Writing and Editing. The Contractor shall develop and write appropriate content, ranging from brief phrases to short articles or fact sheets to lengthy books. This includes developing content for a variety of campaign products. Digital content should be prepared and written in channel-specific formats.

Additionally, social media channels like Twitter will require rewriting of headlines to ensure 140 character limitations are met. The Contractor's written materials shall comply with the guidelines posted at PlainLanguage.gov ( http://www.plainlanguage.gov ), WebContent.gov ( http://www.usa.gov/webcontent/managing_content/writing_and_editing.shtml ), and Usability.gov ( http://usability.gov/methods/design_site/writing4web.html ).

H.10 CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE ACCESS
(a) Sensitive Information, as used in this Chapter, means any information, the loss, misuse, disclosure, or unauthorized access to or modification of which could adversely affect the national or homeland security interest, or the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under section 552a of title 5, United States Code (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense, homeland security or foreign policy. This definition includes the following categories of information: (1) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 29) as amended, the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager or his/her designee); (2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, "Policies and Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of S SI," as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or his/her designee); (3) Information designated as "For Official Use Only," which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and (4) Any information that is designated "sensitive" or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures.

11-223-SOL-00102
drives, network software, computer software, software programs, intranet sites, and internet sites. (c) Contractor employees working on this contract must complete such forms as may be necessary for security or other reasons, including the conduct of background investigations to determine suitability. Completed forms shall be submitted as directed by the Contracting Officer. Upon the Contracting Officer's request, the Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted, or subject to other investigations as required. All contractor employees requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information or IT resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures. (d) The Contracting Officer may require the contractor to prohibit individuals from working on the contract if the government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to, carelessness, insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns. (e) Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information. Therefore, the Contractor shall not disclose, orally or in writing, any sensitive information to any person unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. For those contractor employees authorized access to sensitive information, the contractor shall ensure that these persons receive training concerning the protection and disclosure of sensitive information both during and after contract performance. (f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts at any tier where the subcontractor may have access to Government facilities, sensitive information, or resources. (End of clause)

ALTERNATE I (JUN 2006)
When the contract will require contractor employees to have access to Information Technology (IT) resources, add the following paragraphs: (g) Before receiving access to IT resources under this contract the individual must receive a security briefing, which the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will arrange, and complete any nondisclosure agreement furnished by DHS. (h) The contractor shall have access only to those areas of DHS information technology resources explicitly stated in this contract or approved by the COR in writing as necessary for performance of the work under this contract.

In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate actions with regard to the contract and the individual(s) involved. (i) Contractor access to DHS networks from a remote location is a temporary privilege for mutual convenience while the contractor performs business for the DHS Component. It is not a right, a guarantee of access, a condition of the contract, or Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).

33

11-223-SOL-00102

H.12 FDA 1335 PERSONNEL SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS (AUG 2006)
1. BACKGROUND - The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), requires that DHHS employees and Contractor employees (including subcontractors) who will be working in a DHHS-owned or leased space and/or who will have access to DHHS equipment, and non-public privileged, proprietary, or trade secret information, undergo a background investigation of some type. Contractor employees who will be in DHHS-owned or lease space for less than thirty (30) days are exempted from the background investigation requirement. These contractor employees must be escorted at all time while in DHHS-owned or leased space. 2. GENERAL - The Contractor shall submit the following items to the Contracting Officer, ten (10) calendar days prior to commencement of work under this contract: a. Certification that all required security form packets and a list of contractor employees names for whom the requisite security information has been provided to Division of Security Operations, Policy and Planning, Personnel Security Staff. "Contractor's Commitment to Protect Non-public Information Agreement" forms signed by each employee named in paragraph a. above.

b.

With the exception of costs associated with fingerprinting Contractor employees outside of the FDA Personnel Security Office, the Government will conduct all required background investigations at no cost to the Contractor. The cost of fingerprinting Contractor employees at any location other than the FDA Personnel Security Office will be borne by the Contractor. Contractor employees shall obtain security badges in order to access to DHHS-owned or leased property without an escort. (See Section 3 for details on the badging process) However, in the event that work must commence before security badges can be issued, contractor employees will be allowed onto DHHS-owned or leased property, but must be escorted at all times. All Contractor employees who undergo a background investigation are required to log onto the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP) system to complete the forms necessary to initiate their background investigations. The forms required vary with the position risk levels for the contract. The position risk levels for this contract are Public Trust Positions -TBD by each individual task order. There are two (2) potential position risk levels, which are: a. Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1) (SEE CHART A) - Positions which involve the lowest degree of adverse impact on the efficiency of the Agency. The forms set forth by CHART A are required for Non-Sensitive Positions (Level 1). Contractor employees assigned to Level 1 who receive a security badge will be required to provide additional security information for a background investigation as specified in Paragraph 5 below. Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6) (SEE CHART B) - Positions in which the

b.

35

11-223-SOL-00102
incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish public confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned Government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs. The forms set forth by CHART B are required for Public Trust Positions (Levels 5 or 6). Contractor employees assigned Levels 5 or 6 must receive security badge as well as a background investigation. In order to access the e-QIP system, Contractor employees must provide the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist with the following information: (a) full name; (b) position title; (c) social security number; (d) date of birth; (e) place of birth; (f) email address; and (g) phone number. The Personnel Security Specialist will use this information to initiate each Contractor employee into the e-QIP system. Once this is done, each Contractor employee will receive an email that contains a web link to access the e-QIP system, as well as instructions and additional forms needed to initiate the suitability background investigation. The Project Officer for the contract will provide the name of the appropriate Personnel Security Specialist to the Contractor. A Contractor's failure to comply with the e-QIP processing guidelines will result in that Contractor's employees being denied access to FDA property until all security processing has been completed. 3. BADGING PROCESS - The FDA Project Officer will sponsor Contractor employees on the FDA Form 3391 for the purpose of obtaining an FDA Security Access Card. In order to obtain one, a Contractor employee must receive a "favorable" fingerprint return. Fingerprints must be submitted to the Personnel Security Office at least ten (10) days prior to the commencement of work. Fingerprints will be submitted in one of two ways, depending on where the contract will be performed: a. Contractor employees who will work in the Washington D.C. metro area will, at the direction of the FDA Project Officer or his/her designee, contact the Personnel Security Branch to schedule a fingerprinting appointment, or Contractor employees who will work in a field office will submit fingerprints to: Food and Drug Administration Physical Security Branch. FDA White Oak Command Center 10903 New Hampshire Avenue Silver Spring, MD 20993 301-796-2414.

b.

Upon the receipt of a "favorable" fingerprint return, each Contractor employee must present two forms of identification in order to receive his or her badge. One form of identification must be a government-issued photo identification document. Acceptable forms of photo identification are referenced on the FDA Form 3391. Acceptable forms of secondary identification are listed on the back of the I-9 Form. This form can be obtained at http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/files/i-9.pdf An individual who receives an unfavorable report may appeal that finding by submitting a written request to the Personnel Security Staff. 4. BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS - The Government shall conduct an additional background investigation for those individuals named to risk Levels 1, 5 and 6 serving under this

36

11-223-SOL-00102
contract. Required background investigations may include, but not be limited to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Review of prior Government/military personnel records; Review of FBI records and fingerprint files; Searches of credit bureaus; Personal interviews; and Written inquiries covering the subject's background.

Background investigations will be conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that the integrity of contract performance is maintained pending completion of all appropriate background investigations of Contractor employees. The Contractor shall submit the information required for eQIP access and other requisite forms for the risk level(s) specified. In addition, the Contractor shall provide a cover letter which includes: the Contractor's name, the contract number, the name of the Contracting Officer administering the contract, the names of all Contractor employees' for whom a background check is required and those employees' social security numbers, dates of birth, and former names. This cover letter and all completed forms shall be transmitted, in a separate sealed envelope marked, "TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY," to: Food and Drug Administration OSO/Office of Security Operations Physical Security Branch. FDA White Oak Command Center 10903 New Hampshire Avenue Silver Spring, MD 20993 301-796-2414. The Contractor shall send a separate letter to the Contracting Officer that includes the contract number and employee names. The Contractor shall advise its prospective employees that all standard forms submitted to the FDA will be forwarded to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for scheduling background investigations. Personnel Security Staff will resolve with the contract employee any issues arising out of inaccurate or incomplete forms. Employees who have been previously granted a Government security clearance shall advise Personnel Security Staff of the details of such clearances to determine if a previous clearance level is suitable for the current FDA position. At any time, if a Contractor employee for whom security forms have been submitted is terminated or otherwise ceases work under the contract, the Contractor shall immediately notify Personnel Security Staff, in writing, with copies to the respective FDA Project and Contracting Officers.

37

11-223-SOL-00102

The OPM background investigation will take approximately 120 days. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing if an employee is denied a clearance. Those individuals who have been cleared by Personnel Security Staff may continue to work under the contract. Those who are not cleared must cease work on the contract immediately. If a Contractor employee changes job responsibilities under this contract, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, and the Government will make a determination whether an additional security clearance is required. In the event that a cleared individual is replaced, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer and comply with all requirements of this clause, as specified herein, prior to the commencement of work by the replacement individual. The Contractor shall be responsible for the return of any Government issued security badges to the Project Officer. 6. NON-PUBLIC DATA PROTECTION - The Contractor shall protect the privacy of all information reported by or about contract employees and shall protect against unauthorized disclosure. CHARTS A & B ARE APPENDED TO THIS CLAUSE For clarification purposes and to facilitate the flow of all required security forms, the following matrix is provided:

H.18 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
As a regulatory agency charged with protection of the public health, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must maintain public confidence in the integrity of its decisions. The FDA has various policies and procedures that safeguard against both actual and apparent conflict of interest (COI) on the part of its employees. It is additionally critical that the FDA be assured that there is no actual or apparent COI on the part of either the Contractor's organization or its individual employees in performance of this contract action. Offerors submitting proposals to perform work under this contract must assure the protection of the information and data they receive in performance or under this contract from unauthorized use or disclosure, and must avoid actions that would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality of the Contractor, its employees, or the Government in the performance of this immediate contract and potential participation in future actions. Contractor will be held to the restrictions of the Organizational Conflict of Interest clause, unless an acceptable mitigation of risk plan is proposed, found acceptable by the Government and enforced POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST SPECIFIC TO THIS CONTRACT Offerors shall review the Statement of Work included in each RFTOP in detail to identify any particular aspects that may present organizational or individual COI, either actual or apparent. DEFINITION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST - Conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons or organizations, a person or organization is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, that the person's or organization's objectivity in performing the contract is or might be otherwise impaired, or that the person or organization has or might acquire an unfair competitive advantage (See FAR 9.501).

43

11-223-SOL-00102 H.19 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST/DO NOT COMPETE

The above prohibitions shall also apply to the contractor's employees, subcontractors, consultants or any other person who participates in the performance of this contract. The contractor shall require such persons to sign the below statement agreeing to the above restrictions. The original of the below statement shall be provided to the Contracting Officer, prior to the person beginning work under this contract/order. Noncompliance with the above restrictions and conditions shall be a cause for: termination of this contract for default; and/or, disqualification of any proposal submitted for a competition. ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT FDA Contract No. __________________ I, (Type name of employee), an employee of _________________, agree to: 1) not compete nor assist anyone in competing for any competitive acquisition of the requirements or services described in the documents which the contractor has been provided access to or delivers under this contract; specifically, the FDA's Capital Planning Investment Control documents, process and forms. 2) not furnish either as an employee of a prime contractor or subcontractor the requirements or services described in paragraph a.1) above. ________________________________ Signature _______________________ Date

11-223-SOL-00102

H.21 TRANSITION
The Contractor shall provide all management, administrative, clerical, and supervisory functions required for the effective and efficient performance of this contract. A smooth and orderly transition between the Contractor and a predecessor or successor Contractor is necessary to ensure minimum disruption to vital Government business. The Contractor shall cooperate fully in the transition. The Contractor shall adhere to the same professional and ethical standards of conduct required of Government personnel.

11-223-SOL-00102 H.24 Small Business Subcontracting Plan
The Small Business Act, Public Law 83-163 (hereafter referred to as the Act), began with the statement of Congressional policy quoted at the beginning of this chapter. The Act, as amended, established the authority for loans, procurement set-asides, management counseling, certificates of competency and advocacy to assist small businesses. The 1978 amendments to the Act, Public Law (PL) 95-507, established small business-small purchase set-asides, subcontracting plan requirements for certain prime contracts and provided the statutory basis for the 8(a) Business Development Program. PL 95-507 further required the establishment of an Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) in each Federal agency. It is the policy of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure that opportunities to compete for and receive a fair share of HHS' procurement expenditures are provided to small, 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, Woman Owned, HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned and Minority Owned Small Businesses (hereafter referred to as Small Business). In Section 15 of the Act, it requires that the OSDBU Director to "have supervisory authority over personnel of such agency to the extent that the functions and duties of such personnel relate to functions and duties" under the Act. The OSDBU Director collaborates with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to ensure HHS is actively working to meet and/or exceed its small business goals. The HHS OSDBU title was revised to reflect Office of Small Business Programs in November 2009 (hereafter referred to as OSBP). Section J, Attachment (5) meets the minimum requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, as amended, and implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.7. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) recommend offerors use the attached format to submit proposed Individual Subcontracting Plans, including modifications. It is not intended to replace any existing Corporate/Commercial Plan that is more extensive. A subcontracting Plan is required if the estimated cost of the contract may exceed $650,000. Small businesses are excluded. Questions should be forwarded to the Contracting Officer or Operating Division (OPDIV) Small Business Specialist.

If a subcontract is being used as a past performance reference, contact information for the prime contractor, not the customer, should be included. The list should include the contract/order number, title (if appropriate), the period of performance, and the dollar value of the contract/order. If the contract/order is NOT described in Section 1 of the Technical Volume, the Offeror shall include a one page narrative about the contract/order, describing the nature of the work performed and emphasizing outcomes reached.

The Offeror should send the Past Performance Questionnaire (Section J, Attachment 6) to the sources that it identifies in the past performance volume. The questionnaires should be sent to the individual most knowledgeable about the Offeror's performance on the identified order or program (e.g. the contracting officer's technical representative; the Program/Project Manager; or the Contracting Officer). Each reference must complete the questionnaire and email in PDF format and mail a hard copy to the Contract Specialist. The Offeror may opt to allow the return of completed questionnaires to the Government via electronic mail. This is solely at the discretion of the Offeror, with the understanding that e-mail systems, servers, internet, intranets and extranets are not considered secure. The Offeror shall ensure that all the point of contacts complete and return the questionnaires to the Government prior to the RFQ close date. Offerors are cautioned that the Government may use data provided by each Offeror as well as data obtained from possible other sources such as the National Institute of Health's (NIH) Contractor Performs System (CPARS) or the Department of Defense's Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRs) in the evaluation of past performance. BUSINESS VOLUME INSTRUCTIONS General Instructions The Offeror must submit the cover page (Section A) of this solicitation SF33 ­ Solicitation Offer and Award, with blocks 12 through 18 completed. Block 17 must be signed with an original signature of a person authorized on behalf of the Offeror to sign the offer. The Offeror must submit a proposal that complies with the instructions set forth herein. The price/cost proposal will be used for the purpose of evaluating price/cost for the award of the ID/IQ contract(s).

Offerors shall explain how they intend to budget for costs associated with ID/IQ oversight and reporting requirements. Pagination Every page of the pricing volume shall be numbered. There is no page limit on the pricing volume. Rounding All total dollar amounts provided shall be rounded to the nearest dollar. All loaded labor rates shall be rounded to the nearest cent. Pricing Schedules Offerors are to propose fully burdened rates inclusive of profit. Volume II - IDIQ Pricing Schedule: In the Section B-3, the FDA has provided labor categories, the Offeror shall fill in the fully burdened rate for both Government and Non-Government site. If the Offeror believes that it will need labor categories beyond those included in the worksheet, add rows as appropriate. Fill in the labor category and fully burdened rates columns. Attachment 1 is a pricing schedule with assumed hours per labor category. The Offeror must provide a breakdown of the labor hours, labor rates and labor categories for all contract years using Attachment 1. In order for the Government to evaluate the pricing of all proposals consistently in this environment, the pricing sheet assumes that the Offeror performs all of the estimated IDIQ labor hours in Attachment 1. This assumption is for evaluation purposes only, as the actual number of hours performed under the award may differ. The labor rates used in Attachment 1 must be as provided in Section B-3. Although the labor category titles used in Section B-3 and Attachment 1 may not match the titles used by a particular agency, Offerors must only use those labor categories listed in Attachment 1 when submitting a proposal. If the labor category title differs from what is provided in Section B-3 and Attachment 1, the Offeror must describe which labor category the differing title matches to, thus providing a crosswalk of vendor provided titles to government provided titles. Other Labor Category Descriptions can be found in Section J, Attachment 4. Volume IV - First Task Order Pricing Schedule: The Offeror shall provide a business proposal for the attached Task Order #1 SOW, based on the proposed technical solution. The rates must be in accordance with Section B-3. Although the labor category titles used in Section B-3 may not match the titles used by a particular agency, Offerors must only use those labor categories listed when submitting a proposal. If the labor category title differs from what is provided in Section B-3, the Offeror must describe which labor category the differing title matches to, thus providing a crosswalk of vendor-provided titles to government-provided titles. Other Labor Category Descriptions can be found in Section J, Attachment 4. In addition, Offerors must submit estimated other direct costs, to include travel costs. Travel costs must be in accordance

60

11-223-SOL-00102
with the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR). The level of staff effort for the option years for the first task order will likely vary based upon the proposed technical solution and key deliverables; however, for evaluation purposes only, the option years for the first task order are to assume the following fluctuations in labor across all labor categories to simulate variances in workflow and deliverables over the total period of performance: 75% in option Year 1, 100% in option Year 2, 75% in option Year 3, and 60% in option Year 4. The Task Order #1 business proposal should provide sufficient detail to determine whether the proposed staffing solution represents the best value to FDA. In order to facilitate a thorough understanding of the price proposed, the proposal should include at a minimum: (1) Price detail by task area, (2) narrative providing a basis for the estimate proposed, and (3) Other pertinent data that will aid the Government in determining price reasonableness and realism.

11-223-SOL-00102 SECTION M ­ EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M-1 EVALUATION The Government anticipates awarding up to four contracts as a result of this solicitation to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors in the solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award multiple Task Orders based on the proposed solution provided in response to this solicitation based on Task Order #1 SOW. The Government reserves the right to award the task order based upon initial submission. The Government has determined that technical merit is significantly more important than cost or price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining "Best Value" services than with making an award at the lowest overall cost to the Government. However, FDA will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly higher quality deliverables. Specifically, as technical merit becomes more equal, cost/price becomes more important. The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-offs between technical merit and cost/price offers the greatest overall value to the Government, cost or price and other non-price related factors considered. When combined, all non-price evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than price. If the Project Advisory Group (PAG) determines that competing technical proposals are essentially equal, the price factor becomes increasingly important and may become the determining factor in source selection. The FDA will evaluate past performance as a risk assessment; not as a weighted technical evaluation factor. For Technical Merit, FDA will evaluate proposals using an adjectival rating scheme. FDA will also assign a risk rating to each factor and the overall proposal. Weighting The relative order of importance of the non-priced factors is:    Taken as a whole, FACTOR I--Technical Understanding and Approach is more important than FACTOR II--Relevant Experience and FACTOR III--Management Approach and Organizational Structure combined. FACTOR I--Technical Understanding and Approach sub-factors are listed in descending order of importance. FACTOR II--Relevant Experience is more important than FACTOR III--Management Approach and Organizational Structure.

FACTOR I--TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING AND APPROACH The technical proposal will be evaluated to assess the Offeror's understanding of the scope of the work and its approach and capability to provide the required services.

62

11-223-SOL-00102
Sub-Factor 1 - Task Order #1 The Government will assess the Offeror's understanding of the task order's scope of work; its detailed approach to satisfying the technical requirements; its insights into the intended audience's respective behaviors and its demonstrated capability to effect attitudinal and behavioral change; its ability to anticipate potential technical, programmatic, and business issues and risks and provide approaches for their resolution or mitigation; and, the appropriateness of its proposed project management plan, staffing plan, resumes, and assignment of Key Personnel. A highly rated proposal will present examples of situations where the Offeror employed similar approaches and techniques to successfully influence the behavior and/or attitudes of the intended audience. A very highly rated proposal will also demonstrate the Offeror's capacity for creativity and innovation by citing applicable awards and other examples of third-party recognition received as a result of its proposed approach. Sub-Factor 2 - Technical Scenario: Strategic Media Planning and Buying The Government will evaluate the Offeror's detailed response to the specific requirements of the Technical Scenario including its recommended media strategy and approach to channel planning; its recommended media mix, including the breakdown of percentage spent by media type; the 12-month media flighting chart for each campaign; its recommended analytical measurement plan, including solutions for making mid-course adjustments; its recommended media plan, including proposed budget allocations to most effectively reach and engage teens and young adults; and its recommended fee structure, including potential performance incentives. Sub-Factor 3 ­ IDIQ: Overall Technical Approach The Government will evaluate the Offeror's overall understanding of the challenges presented in the IDIQ Statement of Work; its technical approach to providing the services detailed in the Task Areas; and its capacity to meet the technical requirements. Special emphasis will be placed on the following: the Offeror's capacity for strategic campaign planning and formative research; its ability to produce targeted messages and creative content and materials to convey complex science-based information in an understandable way to key audiences; its knowledge and understanding of the range of applicable marketing, communication, media and outreach channels and techniques and its approach to employing them to raise awareness in the intended audience segments and change societal norms. A highly rated proposal will present examples of situations where the Offeror has employed similar approaches and activities to successfully influence the behavior and/or attitudes of a target audience. A very highly rated proposal will also demonstrate the Offeror's capacity for creativity and innovation by citing applicable awards and other examples of third-party recognition received as a result of its work in services similar to those detailed in the Task Areas. FACTOR II--RELEVANT EXPERIENCE The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror's proposal demonstrates the success of efforts on current and previous contracts which are relevant to the Statement of Work in terms of type, scope, complexity, and size. The Government will also evaluate the relevance of the creative samples submitted with each project description. A highly rated proposal will (1) provide relevant experiences appropriate to the SOW task areas; (2) clearly demonstrate the similarity and relevance to work to be performed under this effort; and, (3) will contain at least

63

11-223-SOL-00102
one narrative example that demonstrates the Offeror's ability to overcome difficulties encountered during performance with minimum impact to the project.

FACTOR III--MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror's proposal demonstrates a comprehensive and effective management approach to ensure the accomplishment of FDA objectives. Particular emphasis will be placed upon the Offeror's ability to ensure full integration among all campaign elements, including advertising, public relations, and special events, and among all service providers including sub-contractors; to attract, coordinate, and retain key staff resources; and, its ability to identify and manage major risks and challenges to program success. The Government will also evaluate the Offeror's organizational structure for its impact on contract/task order performance and administration. PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offer. Performance risks are those associated with an Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that Offeror's record of past performance. The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an Offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information. When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the Offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the Offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the Offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the Offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the Offeror's performance. The lack of a past performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offer. PRICE EVALUATION FDA will evaluate the price realism of the Offeror's proposed IDIQ Labor Rates. The FDA's evaluation of cost reasonableness will consider the Labor Rates provided in B-3, the Pricing schedule provided (Section J, Attachment 1) and the First Task Order to the extent to which proposed labor hour, labor mix and labor rates indicate a clear understanding of the first task order requirements, reflects a sound approach to satisfying those requirements, and is consistent with the approach described in the Offeror's technical volume proposal. The cost

64

11-223-SOL-00102
reasonableness assessment will consider technical and management risks identified during evaluation of the proposal. Unrealistically low proposed rates/hours (initially or subsequently) may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the Offeror either doesn't understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic proposal. M-2 FFRDC EVALUATION SUPPORT Offerors are hereby notified that the Government may use the support of a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) contractor and/or of a commercial contractor to assist in the evaluation process. The FFRDC contractor shall follow established standards of conduct during the source selection process and shall maintain confidentiality of proprietary and source selection information.
