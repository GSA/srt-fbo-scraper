Server Virtualization Licenses



Introduction:

ATD operates IBM HS-22 blade servers in support of Oracle 11, Sakai, Kuali Rice, Kuali COEUS, UPortal, UMobile, JASIG CAS, research applications and Red Hat Directory.  Applications are operated on Red Hat and Windows operating systems.  The USU seeks to increase the efficiency of its available hardware platforms to support its mission while minimizing future procurements of hardware.



The USU requests pricing for software to support the server virtualization of 8, 12, 15 and 20 servers.  See Quote Format below for additional information.



Specification Requirements:

The offeror must address in a technical proposal how the software supports the following requirements:  

Management and Allocation

Must be capable of managing resources (processor, memory, storage, and network connectivity) across system enclosures and across physical locations within a single resource pool.

Must be capable of creating and managing multiple resource pools from a single interface.

Must be capable of managing and utilizing differing blade and enclosure configurations within the same resource pool (see Compatibility & Redundancy below).

Must offer a management platform for creation of virtual machines and allocation of hardware resources, including priority-based 'surge' capacity for high-demand situations.

Must offer a graphical interface for management of all virtual machines / servers / virtualized hardware.

Must offer hardware status reporting, including at a minimum:

Graphical display of hardware status (up / down).

Overall and per-virtual machine processor load / utilization.

Overall and per-virtual machine memory load / utilization.

Overall and per-virtual machine storage load / utilization.

Overall and per-virtual machine network load / utilization.

SNMP reporting of system utilization / state information.

Email notification of hardware and virtual machine outage.

Must offer a command line interface allowing for scripting of system operations (including the deployment of new virtual instances).

Must offer the ability to automatically deploy new machine instances when the virtual machines within a pool are under heavy load.

Must be capable of dynamic resource reallocation (up to the degree supported by the hosted operating system) to reapportion hardware resources as needed by existing virtual machines.

Storage Management

Must be capable of managing and allocating storage area network (SAN) space across a range of systems, including the pooling of systems from different vendors.

Must not interfere with virtual machines' ability to connect to / attach / mount (at normal speeds) SAN systems which are not managed by the virtualization solution.

Hosted Virtual Machines

Must work transparently and simultaneously with various flavors of Linux and Windows, to at a minimum include:

Windows Server 2008 (x32 and x64)

Windows Server 2008 R2 (x32 and x64)

Windows Server 2003 x32

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1

Must be able to deploy new virtual machines / instances from a template or image.

Must provide a tool for physical to virtual machine migration.

Compatibility & Redundancy

Must fully support IBM BladeCenter S storage and networking systems.

Must fully support IBM HS22 blade servers.

Must fully support resource pooling with existing offsite datacenter(s) managed by VMWare vSphere and allow for a unified management interface.

Must offer automated notification of hardware failure within the resource pool.

Must offer automated notification of virtual machine failure including the ability to automatically start a new instance of the machine.

Priority will be given to a platform which efficiently supports a wide range of hardware configurations.
