CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT
52.252-1     SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)

This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full
text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The offeror is cautioned that the listed provisions may include
blocks that must be completed by the offeror and submitted with its quotation or offer. In lieu of submitting the full text of those provisions,
the offeror may identify the provision by paragraph identifier and provide the appropriate information with its quotation or offer. Also, the
full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):

The FAR full text of solicitation provision/clauses may be accessed electronically at the following address:
http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFFARA.HTM. The DFAR full text may be accessed electronically at the following address:
http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARa.HTM.

                                                                (End of provision)

52.212-2 -- EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS.
As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows:
                                                    Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:


      (1) Price
      (2) Technical Capability

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

                                                                (End of Provision)


52.212-4 -- Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items.

As prescribed in 12.301(b)(3), insert the following clause:
                                           Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items (Feb 2007)
(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The
Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require
repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If
repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the government may seek an equitable price reduction or
adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights --
           (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
           (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.
(b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a
bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31
U.S.C.3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Government wide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not
assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.
(c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.
(d) Disputes. This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). Failure of the parties to this
contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be
a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor
shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.
(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.
(f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control
of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign
or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers.
The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable
delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly
give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.
(g) Invoice.
           (1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated
           in the contract to receive invoices. An invoice must include --
                 (i) Name and address of the Contractor;
                 (ii) Invoice date and number;

           Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its
           information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the

                 Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to:

                 agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name
                 agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be
                 considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds
                 transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the
CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.
