2.1 Background The National Information Technology Center (NITC) is a part of the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). The mission of NITC is to enable Government agencies to achieve their missions by providing innovative, cost effective, and secure information technology solutions. The NITC provides information management services and technology to support the missions of the USDA and its agencies, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), General Services Administration (GSA), and other Government clients. NITC headquarters is located in Kansas City, Missouri, with employees also stationed in Fort Collins, Colorado, St. Louis, Missouri, and Washington D.C. The NITC is a centralized computing facility of mainframe and mid-range platforms, software and support. NITC customers access their services from remote locations throughout the continental United States via private and public networks. NITC's computing facility of mainframe and mid range platforms, software and support represents leading edge capability, consistency, and reliability. The applications that run in the NITC environment are national in scope and importance, directly serving approximately 70,000 end users. The NITC works closely with customers to provide the technical resources, the expertise and the processing environments critical to their applications. NITC's primary production facility is located at 8930 Ward Parkway, Kansas City, Missouri, and disaster recovery facility is located at 4300 Goodfellow Boulevard, Bldg 104, in St. Louis, Missouri.

2.2 Statement of Work USDA requires service for the maintenance of EMC Equipment at the USDA National Information Technology Center's (NITC) Data Centers. LOCATIONS (codes, description, address) NITC KCMO: 8930 Ward Parkway, Kansas City, MO, 64114 NITC GoodFellow: Building 104 Second Floor, OCIO/NITC Computer Room, 4300 Goodfellow Blvd, St. Louis MO 63120 NITC SLC: 2222 W 2300 S., Salt Lake City, UT 84119 - 2020 NITC Fort Collins: 2150 Centre Dr.,Building A, Ft Collins, CO 80526 NITC Ft. Worth: 509 W. Felix St. Bldg. 23 Fort Worth, Tx 76115

Tasks to be Performed: Machine service response shall be 24 x 7 x 4, provided access site is available with necessary USDA on site support. Hardware maintenance shall include disk retention for all covered items. The contractor shall reconcile inventories of the above NITC Data Centers against the existing EMC equipment inventory that is not on an existing USDA contract or lease, including the current status of warranty and maintenance levels, verification of equipment serial numbers, assigned service levels, and end of service life status. The contractor shall develop a comprehensive system for the tracking of covered EMC equipment warranties so that the systems which are ending their respective warranty periods can be added to the Maintenance Services Contract in a timely manner. The contractor will identify and review the current EMC Call Center procedures for incoming service calls from NITC personnel, paying special attention to established EMC protocols for managing non-standard calls (i.e., covered hardware or software not listed in the EMC database or equipment that is flagged for non-payment of Maintenance Services invoices, resulting in NITC calls being significantly delayed when referred to Entitlement Verification, and so on). Once completed, the contractor will ask the NITC to identify and possibly allow the contractor to interview end users who have had actual experience with the EMC Call Center.

RFQ No. AG-3142-S-10-0019

The contractor shall develop a procedure with NITC staff to coordinate the deletion of covered EMC equipment from NITC service and the removal of the units from the Maintenance Services Contract. The contractor shall implement an internal billing review process intended to provide validated invoices for maintenance services to the NITC. Should an invoice require any change in the amount billed due to modifications of NITC inventory, the contractor will identify the changes and seek approval for the revised invoice as a component to the billing review process. It should be the contractor's intention to develop an expedited review and approval process with the NITC in order to assure prompt billing and payment of submitted invoices.

RFQ No. AG-3142-S-10-0019

2.1 Background The National Information Technology Center (NITC) is a part of the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). The mission of NITC is to enable Government agencies to achieve their missions by providing innovative, cost effective, and secure information technology solutions. The NITC provides information management services and technology to support the missions of the USDA and its agencies, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), General Services Administration (GSA), and other Government clients. NITC headquarters is located in Kansas City, Missouri, with employees also stationed in Fort Collins, Colorado, St. Louis, Missouri, and Washington D.C. The NITC is a centralized computing facility of mainframe and mid-range platforms, software and support. NITC customers access their services from remote locations throughout the continental United States via private and public networks. NITC's computing facility of mainframe and mid range platforms, software and support represents leading edge capability, consistency, and reliability. The applications that run in the NITC environment are national in scope and importance, directly serving approximately 70,000 end users. The NITC works closely with customers to provide the technical resources, the expertise and the processing environments critical to their applications. NITC's primary production facility is located at 8930 Ward Parkway, Kansas City, Missouri, and disaster recovery facility is located at 4300 Goodfellow Boulevard, Bldg 104, in St. Louis, Missouri.

2.2 Statement of Work USDA requires service for the maintenance of EMC Equipment at the USDA National Information Technology Center's (NITC) Data Centers. LOCATIONS (codes, description, address) NITC KCMO: 8930 Ward Parkway, Kansas City, MO, 64114 NITC GoodFellow: Building 104 Second Floor, OCIO/NITC Computer Room, 4300 Goodfellow Blvd, St. Louis MO 63120 NITC SLC: 2222 W 2300 S., Salt Lake City, UT 84119 - 2020 NITC Fort Collins: 2150 Centre Dr.,Building A, Ft Collins, CO 80526 NITC Ft. Worth: 509 W. Felix St. Bldg. 23 Fort Worth, Tx 76115

Tasks to be Performed: Machine service response shall be 24 x 7 x 4, provided access site is available with necessary USDA on site support. Hardware maintenance shall include disk retention for all covered items. The contractor shall reconcile inventories of the above NITC Data Centers against the existing EMC equipment inventory that is not on an existing USDA contract or lease, including the current status of warranty and maintenance levels, verification of equipment serial numbers, assigned service levels, and end of service life status. The contractor shall develop a comprehensive system for the tracking of covered EMC equipment warranties so that the systems which are ending their respective warranty periods can be added to the Maintenance Services Contract in a timely manner. The contractor will identify and review the current EMC Call Center procedures for incoming service calls from NITC personnel, paying special attention to established EMC protocols for managing non-standard calls (i.e., covered hardware or software not listed in the EMC database or equipment that is flagged for non-payment of Maintenance Services invoices, resulting in NITC calls being significantly delayed when referred to Entitlement Verification, and so on). Once completed, the contractor will ask the NITC to identify and possibly allow the contractor to interview end users who have had actual experience with the EMC Call Center.

Page 4 of 19

RFQ No. AG-3142-S-10-0019

The contractor shall develop a procedure with NITC staff to coordinate the deletion of covered EMC equipment from NITC service and the removal of the units from the Maintenance Services Contract. The contractor shall implement an internal billing review process intended to provide validated invoices for maintenance services to the NITC. Should an invoice require any change in the amount billed due to modifications of NITC inventory, the contractor will identify the changes and seek approval for the revised invoice as a component to the billing review process. It should be the contractor's intention to develop an expedited review and approval process with the NITC in order to assure prompt billing and payment of submitted invoices.
