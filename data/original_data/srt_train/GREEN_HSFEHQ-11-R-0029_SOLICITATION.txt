SECTION C -STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Flood Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning (Risk MAP) Customer and Data Services I. DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE:

As part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has operated the Flood Map Modernization (Map Mod) program since 2004. Funding for Map Mod ended in FY2008, however work continues on the projects that were funded during the Map Mod program. Map Mod began the work of conducting a large-scale overhaul of the nation's flood hazard maps. Work accomplished under Map Mod has included data collection and analysis, map production, product delivery, and effective program management. This initiative produced digital flood hazard data, provided access to flood hazard data and maps via the Internet, and implemented a nationwide state-of-the-art infrastructure that enables all-hazard mapping. In Fiscal Year 2009, FEMA began the Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning (Risk MAP) Program. The vision for Risk MAP is to deliver quality data that increases public awareness and leads to action that reduces risk to life and property. Risk MAP builds on flood hazard data and maps produced during the Map Mod program. Since the political and technological environments are continuing to evolve, this initiative will require the continuous review of existing systems and potential development of new standards or approaches in meeting the objectives outlined below. FEMA acknowledges that its current systems do not maximize technology, innovation and performance. FEMA's goal with this SOO is to receive solutions that are innovative, proven, easy to implement and effective, while also not programmatically disruptive. In light of constant funding constraints, solutions should be phased or have standalone components which can be implemented without the realization of the entire, broad solution. The purpose of this Statement of Objectives (SOO) is to obtain contracted support which will replace the expiring Customer and Data Services (CDS) contract. The CDS provider will support the completion of Map Mod projects as well as support Risk MAP operations and the changes necessary to fully enable the Risk MAP vision. This SOO will address only the Customer and Data Services acquisition. Other aspects of the program have been addressed in separate documents. II. BACKGROUND:

FEMA's flood maps are one of the essential tools for flood hazard mitigation in the United States. These maps are used an estimated 20 million times annually in the private and public sectors, in the following ways: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Lending institutions and insurance companies use them to determine who needs flood insurance and to determine flood insurance rates. Community planning officials, land developers, and engineers use them for designing and siting new buildings and infrastructure to be safe from flooding. States and communities use them for hazard mitigation planning and emergency management. Federal agencies use them when implementing Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management.

FEMA's Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA) is undergoing shifts in how it delivers information necessary for flood hazard reduction. FIMA's Risk Analysis Division (RAD) is in the early years of implementing the Risk MAP Program. In March 2009, FEMA issued a Multi-Year Plan for Risk MAP, which C-1

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029

Section C

can be found online at the Risk MAP page on FEMA's website: http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/fhm/rm_main.shtm. III. FEMA STRATEGIC INITIATIVES:

FEMA's mission, as laid out in the Fiscal Years 2011-2014 FEMA Strategic Plan, is "to support our citizens and first responders to ensure that as a nation we work together to build, sustain, and improve our capability to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate all hazards." Risk MAP clearly helps ensure that both the Nation, as well as individual communities, are prepared for future floods and other hazard events. With accurate, up to date flood hazard data, states and communities have the tools to reduce future flood losses. FEMA's Strategic Plan leverages the core values and guiding principles of "compassion, fairness, integrity, and respect," and identifies the following initiatives for 2011-2014: 1. 2. 3. 4. IV. Foster a Whole Community Approach to Emergency Management Nationally; Build the Nation's Capacity to Stabilize and Recover From a Catastrophic Event; Build Unity of Effort and Common Strategic Understanding Among the Emergency Management Team; Enhance FEMA's Ability to Learn and Innovate as an Organization. FEDERAL INSURANCE AND MITIGATION ADMINISTRATION MISSION:

The mission of FIMA is to create safer communities by reducing loss of life and property; enable individuals to recover more rapidly from floods and other disasters; and lessen the financial impact of disasters on the Nation. This is accomplished through three primary objectives:

ˇ ˇ ˇ

Analyze Risk - Determining the impact of natural hazards that lead to effective strategies for reducing risk. Reduce Risk - Reducing or eliminating long-term risk from hazards on the existing built environment and future construction. Insure for Flood Risk - Reducing the impact of floods on the Nation by providing affordable flood insurance.

FIMA's high level goals are to Value People and Relationships, Enhance Credibility, and Advance Hazard Mitigation in Support of Sustainability. V. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

In order to leverage the successes of Map Modernization and further enhance the usability and value of flood hazard mapping, FEMA has developed the Risk MAP program. Risk MAP combines flood hazard mapping, risk assessment tools and Hazard Mitigation Planning into one seamless program. The intent of this integrated Risk MAP program is to encourage beneficial partnerships and innovative uses of flood hazard and risk assessment data in order to maximize flood loss reduction. The Risk MAP MultiYear Plan is available online at http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=3587. The objectives of Risk MAP are:

C-2

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029

Section C

ˇ

Assess Nation's flood risk and use this information to increase public awareness of risk. This consistent, quantitative flood risk assessment will be used to track progress toward reducing flood risk and to target resources. Increase public awareness of risk from natural hazards and establish a baseline of local knowledge and understanding of risk management concepts. Ensure 80 percent of the Nation's flood hazards are current ­ the flood hazard data are new, have been updated, or deemed still valid. o Provide updated flood hazard data for 100 percent of the populated coastal areas in the Nation. o Evaluate levee status information to ensure the appropriate flood hazards are depicted on Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps for counties with levees, including those impacted by expiring Provisionally Accredited Levee status.

ˇ ˇ

ˇ

Continue to meet statutory requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program through assessing on a watershed basis, the need to revise and update all floodplain areas and flood risk zones identified, delineated, or established.

The goals of Risk MAP include:

ˇ ˇ ˇ

Goal 1: Address gaps in flood hazard data to form a solid foundation for flood risk assessments, floodplain management, and actuarial soundness of the National Flood Insurance Program. Goal 2: Ensure that a measurable increase of the public's awareness and understanding of risk management results in a measurable reduction of current and future vulnerability to flooding. Goal 3: Lead and support states, local and tribal communities to effectively engage in risk-based mitigation planning resulting in sustainable actions that reduce or eliminate risks to life and property from natural hazards. Goal 4: Provide an enhanced digital platform that improves management of limited Risk MAP resources, stewards information produced by Risk MAP, and improves communication and sharing of risk data and related products to all levels of government and the public. Goal 5: Align Risk Analysis programs and develop synergies to enhance decision-making capabilities through effective risk communication and management.

ˇ

ˇ

In 2008, FEMA crafted an acquisition strategy to optimize stakeholder acceptance; deliver results using an enabling vision; ensure needed flexibility and adaptability exists; facilitate smooth and seamless transition; and provide innovation with problem solving capabilities to meet the challenges facing the Risk MAP program. This strategy involved a restructuring of the business model where a National Service Provider provided program management, customer service and many other services required to run the overall effort. The approach includes establishing separate contracts to provide three groupings of services:

C-3

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029 ˇ ˇ ˇ

Section C

Program Management (PM) Customer and Data Services (CDS) Production and Technical Services (PTS)

The CDS contract is expiring and a new provider must be acquired. This acquisition is for the CDS provider only; PTS and PM providers are not a part of this acquisition.

VI. UNIVERSAL OBJECTIVES FOR PROGRAM MANAGEMENT; CUSTOMER AND DATA SERVICES; AND PRODUCTION AND TECHNICAL SERVICES
While each area will have separate contract(s), the success or failure of Risk MAP will hinge on the interaction and cooperation of all contractors working as a team to ensure the smooth, seamless flow of information to all stakeholders and partners, both internal and external, and a comprehensive, coordinated approach to provide information AND services to customers at all levels. A failure by a single contractor at any level may lead to Risk MAP program failure. It is the responsibility of all contractors to participate as team members with all other contractors. To this end, FEMA has established Universal Objectives for all Risk MAP contractors. Additionally, there are Overarching Assumptions and Constraints that apply to all contractors. Universal Objectives: Universal Objective A: Provide a high level of cooperation across the Risk MAP program contractors, ensuring that the Risk MAP program mission overrides the individual contractors' preferences. Universal Objective B: Implement program cost, schedule, scope, and quality management practices that enable reliable and efficient operations and forward-thinking innovation throughout the Risk MAP program.  Ensure that internal contractor systems for earned value management and performance management integrate with the Risk MAP program systems  Monitor, evaluate, and mitigate risks within the CDS portion of Risk MAP  Comply with the Risk MAP change control process  Support the Risk MAP Program Management contractor in achieving the Program's goals Overarching Assumptions and Constraints: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ All activities align with DHS/FEMA strategic goals and constraints All contractors will work together with FEMA to develop program goals and shared metrics that demonstrate the Risk MAP program goals are achieved. Outreach activities are coordinated, integrated, and consistent with Risk MAP messaging throughout the Risk MAP program including appropriate advisory focus groups Solutions leverage existing FEMA investments and resources, are cost effective, and demonstrate a sound return on investment (ROI) The solution meeting these goals and objectives must address important federal mandates and business drivers, including, but not limited to: the Government Paperwork Elimination Act; the Government Information Security Reform Act; the Clinger-Cohen Act; the Government Performance C-4

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029

Section C

and Results Act; the Federal Records Act; the Computer Security Act; the Freedom of Information Act; the Disabilities Act; Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act; the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000; the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994;the Stafford Act; the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969; and other laws and regulations specific to FEMA. ˇ The solution must comply with all statutes and demonstrate working knowledge of applicable regulations, policies, guidelines, and specifications that affect the NFIP, the mission of the Department of Homeland Security, and related multi-hazard programs including risk assessment in a pre- and post- disaster environment. The solution must demonstrate the flexibility to accommodate a changing environment that includes a shift to all hazards and homeland security. In addition, the solution may recommend changes to improve efficiency and effectiveness of Risk MAP program functions and management. Data security and privacy issues are a major focus of the federal government's information technology efforts. All activities must be compliant with the Government Information Security Reform Act, OMB policies, and FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security requirements. Information technology (IT) systems must be coordinated with and comply with FEMA and Department of Homeland Security enterprise architecture requirements. The solution must include a transition strategy describing how continuity of services will be maintained (e.g., production of flood hazard maps and related products, customer service and community outreach, program oversight, etc.) CUSTOMER AND DATA SERVICES OBJECTIVES.

ˇ ˇ

VII.

Each Objective is split into two sections: Operations and Improvements. The purpose of this is to differentiate between the ongoing operations and maintenance objectives from the objectives that are proposed to improve or enhance the new Risk MAP program. The Projects and Improvements sub-objectives are divided into "Primary" and "Secondary" lists. All solutions should cover all sub-objectives, however those deemed Secondary are more likely to be constrained by funding and resources. OBJECTIVE 1 Provide and Improve Direct, Knowledgeable, and Friendly Customer Service: Leverage existing systems and operations - and, where appropriate, use proven new media - to disseminate Risk MAP outreach, products and support. In coordination with content providers, identify the most effective medium for delivery and implement. Operations ˇ Provide technical support to prepare, deliver and maintain content from a variety of sources for posting to FEMA.gov or other relevant websites. ˇ Provide a Contact Center, staffed with employees that have experience with Letters of Map Amendment, to respond to stakeholder inquiries regarding the NFIP and Risk MAP programs, as well as providing technical and system support. ˇ Create the materials for and deliver outreach and training to stakeholders on a variety of Risk MAP tools. ˇ Provide an effective mechanism for effective internal communication and coordination for Risk MAP initiatives across FEMA staff, contractors, and, on a limited basis, partners.

VIII. DEFINITIONS:

Change Management: (Two perspectives apply). From the standpoint of systems engineering, change management is instituting a change control process and release management plan for IT systems that efficiently meets stakeholder needs and business requirements. From the standpoint of meeting desired future conditions, change management means providing support and guidance to reach improved stakeholder involvement and communication, improved alignment of technology with business processes and improved understanding and implementation of policies. Continuous Improvement is adaptation of systems and processes based on consistent solicitation of feedback and other data, and evaluation of changes to ensure they met needs. Data Center 2 (DC2) is a DHS owned IT hosting facility. The Mapping Information Platform (MIP) Production environment will be moved to this facility and hosted here as of April 2011. Hazus is a risk assessment software program for analyzing potential losses from floods, hurricane winds and earthquakes. In Hazus, current scientific and engineering knowledge is coupled with the latest geographic information systems( GIS) technology to produce estimates of hazard-related damage before or after a disaster occurs. Life cycle development methodology is the model of processes that will be used to create or refine a system and drive improvement of the system. "Map Service Center data distribution" includes data storage, archival repository, distribution, and inventory control of paper and digital products, with focus on transition to all-digital. Partner: An entity that leverages resources with FEMA, and potentially other entities, to achieve a shared vision of hazard and risk information communication. Partners typically provide access to data that they maintain, but may also provide other types of support. Products developed under Risk MAP includes Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), Flood Insurance Studies (FIS), Letters of Map Change (LOMC), Hazus, Flood Risk Maps, Flood Risk Database, and Flood Risk Report. Products may change or increase as the Risk MAP Program continues to evolve. C-7

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029

Section C

"Projects and Improvements" refers to initiatives within Risk MAP that go through an investment review prior to funding; are projects with a definable start and end; and result in an efficiency, improvement or benefit to the Risk MAP program. Risk Analysis Division programs: includes, at a minimum, Flood Hazard Mapping, Risk Assessment, Hazard Mitigation Planning, Dam Safety and others as identified. Stakeholder: Has vested interest in Risk MAP programs but may not be contributing data. Stakeholders include partners and users, in addition to other entities. Current stakeholders include general public, state and local officials, lenders, insurance agents, realtors, homebuilders, environmental groups, engineers, surveyors, planners, flood insurance policy holders, other Federal Agencies, Congress, Office of Management and Budget and others. User: Any technical or non-technical customers accessing, utilizing, or manipulating Risk MAP data, products, or systems. IX. ˇ ˇ ˇ CUSTOMER AND DATA SERVICES ASSUMPTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS: The CDS Contractor will support rapid issue resolution requests, such as requests and demands from Congress and other issues that arise that need immediate attention and quick responses. The NFIP and Risk MAP program must be agile in order to be sustainable. Funding is dependent upon the NFIP premiums and year-by-year appropriations. Currently, there is no guarantee that these Programs continue to be funded, or even authorized, from year to year. Contractors must comply with all DHS information technology requirements including but not limited to: ° Data center policy ° Enterprise Architecture ° IT security ° Enterprise Architecture target for geospatial information infrastructure requirements ° 508 compliance FEMA is consolidating all its development, testing, production, and disaster recovery environments to the two DHS Enterprise Data Centers. All applications shall be hosted at a DHS Enterprise Data Center, unless FEMA obtains a waiver approved by the DHS CIO. The DHS Data Center 2 (DC2) will host the Production environment of the Mapping Information Platform (MIP). This will require some CDS staff to occasionally work on site at the DC2 facility.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

ˇ ˇ
ˇ

All solutions must include a Data Quality Plan using the DHS Data Quality Planning Guidance and template. All solutions must investigate the use of the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) for data feeds and information exchanges as a means of improving the quality of information exchanged and minimizing the number of separate data feeds and information exchange developed. The DHS Systems Engineering LifeCycle (SELC) or comparable FEMA version of the DHS SELC shall be incorporated into the solutions approach.
Enterprise Licenses may be available through DHS and FEMA, and must always be investigated as part of the solution.

An integrated approach to E-commerce and fee collection. Change management Continuous improvement of systems IT Architecture for Risk MAP Solutions for making systems easy to use, (e.g. single point of entry, propagating data to avoid multiple manual entries, usability, user-centric design). Existing FEMA systems to be leveraged may include but are not limited to: MSC; FEMA Map Information eXchange (FMIX) call center; mitigation plan tracking systems; Coordinated Needs Management Strategy; Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Verification Tool (DVT); National Flood Hazard Layer; Map Viewer tools; Risk MAP Portal Sharepoint; FEMA's National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS); Mapping Information Platform; Community Information System; NextGen; Floodsmart; Mid-term Levee Inventory; FEMA Levee Information System; HAZUS tools and data; engineering studies library; e-commerce, fee collection, and data and paper map delivery solutions of the MSC. The MIP and MSC servers currently store large amounts of data that support the program. Below is the usage and availability on these servers: o MIP Production environment, FEMA-owned storage area network (SAN): 61TB used, 78 TB allocated, 98 TB total on SAN o MIP Production environment, DHS DC2 servers: 125 TB used, 134 TB allocated, 200 TB total on SAN o MIP Development and Test environments, hosted by CDS contractor: 207 GB used, 35 TB allocated o MSC, hosted by CDS contractor: 35 TB used, 50 TB allocated, 120 TB total on SAN Over the past year the MIP and MSC have seen growth in the amount of data that resides on the systems. The growth rate over a recent 12-month period was: o MIP Production environment, FEMA-owned SAN: 21% o MIP Production environment, DHS DC2 servers: 60% o MIP Development and Test environments, hosted by CDS contractor: 10% o MSC, hosted by CDS contractor: 25% The contact center is operated Monday-Friday, 8AM-6:30PM EST, self service options are available 24/7. The contact center may be closed for federal holidays. Historically, the contact center receives approximately 15,500 calls per month that can be responded to by the contact center staff (Tier 1). Additionally, approximately 500 requests per month are elevated to "Tier 2" meaning that they require coordination with one of the Production and Technical Services contractors to provide a complete answer. Historically, the contact center receives approximately 1100 emails per month through "Email a Map Specialist," "Ask the Expert" and the MSC email address. Currently, the contact center is required to meet the follow minimum metrics: o Average speed of answer: 40 seconds o Service performance: 83% calls answered within 45 seconds o Call abandon rate: 5% o Average talk time: 5 minutes 30 seconds o Average handle time: 6 minutes 30 seconds o Voicemails: respond within 2 business days Over the past year, approximately 2500 MT-1 cases (Letters of Map Amendment and Letters of Map Revision Based on Fill, conditional and final) per month and 100 MT-2 cases (Letters of Map Revision, conditional and final) per month were received at the Letter of Map Change (LOMC) Clearinghouse.

I.2 52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 14 days. I.3 52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of the end of the contract including exercised options; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 14 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five (5) years and six (6) months. I.4 52.219-9 SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTING PLAN ALTERNATE II (OCT 2001) (DEVIATION) (a) This clause does not apply to small business concerns. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause"Commercial item" means a product or service that satisfies the definition of commercial item in section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. "Commercial plan" means a subcontracting plan (including goals) that covers the offeror's fiscal year and that applies to the entire production of commercial items sold by either the entire company or a portion thereof (e.g., division, plant, or product line).

Section I

"Individual contract plan" means a subcontracting plan that covers the entire contract period (including option periods), applies to a specific contract, and has goals that are based on the offeror's planned subcontracting in support of the specific contract, except that indirect costs incurred for common or joint purposes may be allocated on a prorated basis to the contract. "Master plan" means a subcontracting plan that contains all the required elements of an individual contract plan, except goals, and may be incorporated into individual contract plans, provided the master plan has been approved. "Subcontract" means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime Contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract. "Direct Subcontract Award" means a subcontract award that is identified with the performance of one or more specific Government contracts. "Indirect Subcontract Award" means a subcontract award which, because of incurrence for common or joint purposes, is not identified with one or more specific Government contracts. Such subcontract awards are related to Government contract performance but remain for allocation after direct subcontract awards have been determined and identified to specific Government contracts. (c) Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall include a subcontracting plan that separately addresses subcontracting with small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. If the offeror is submitting an individual contract plan, the plan must separately address subcontracting with small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns, with a separate part for the basic contract and separate parts for each option (if any). The plan shall be included in and made a part of the resultant contract. The subcontracting plan shall be negotiated within the time specified by the Contracting Officer. Failure to submit and negotiate a subcontracting plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract. (d) The offeror's subcontracting plan shall include the following: (1) Goals, expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars, for the use of small business, veteran-owned small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. The offeror shall include all subcontracts that contribute to contract performance, and may include a proportionate share of products and services that are normally allocated as indirect costs. (2) A statement of(i) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted for an individual contract plan; or the offeror's total projected sales, expressed in dollars, and the total value of projected subcontracts to support the sales for a commercial plan; (ii) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small business concerns; (iii) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to veteran-owned small business concerns; (iv) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to service-disabled veteran-owned small business; (v) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to HUBZone small business concerns; (vi) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small disadvantaged business concerns; and (vii) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to women-owned small business concerns.

Section I

(3) A description of the principal types of supplies and services to be subcontracted, and an identification of the types planned for subcontracting to(i) Small business concerns; (ii) Veteran-owned small business concerns; (iii) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns; (iv) HUBZone small business concerns; (v) Small disadvantaged business concerns; and (vi) Women-owned small business concerns. (4) A description of the method used to develop the subcontracting goals in paragraph (d) (1) of this clause.

A firm may rely on the information contained in CCR's Dynamic Small Business Search function, as an accurate representation of a concern's size and ownership characteristics for the purposes of maintaining a small veteranowned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business source list. Use of CCR's Dynamic Small Business Search function as its source list does not relieve a firm of its responsibilities (e.g., outreach, assistance counseling, or publicizing subcontracting opportunities) in this clause. (6) A statement as to whether or not the offeror included indirect costs in establishing subcontracting goals, and a description of the method used to determine the proportionate share of indirect costs to be incurred with(i) Small business concerns; (ii) Veteran-owned small business concerns; (iii) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns; (iv) HUBZone small business concerns; (v) Small disadvantaged business concerns; and (vi) Women-owned small business concerns. (7) The name of the individual employed by the offeror who will administer the offeror's subcontracting program, and a description of the duties of the individual. (8) A description of the efforts the offeror will make to assure that small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns have an equitable opportunity to compete for subcontracts. (9) Assurances that the offeror will include the clause of this contract entitled "Utilization of Small Business Concerns" in all subcontracts that offer further subcontracting opportunities, and that the offeror will require all subcontractors (except small business concerns) that receive subcontracts in excess of $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction of any public facility) to adopt a subcontracting plan that complies with the requirements of this clause. (10) Assurances that the offeror will(i) Cooperate in any studies or surveys as may be required;

The reports shall provide information on subcontract awards to small business concerns, veteran-owned small business concerns, service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, HUBZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, women-owned small business concerns, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions. Reporting shall be in accordance with the instructions in eSRS as supplemented by agency regulations; (iv) Ensure that its subcontractors with subcontracting plans agree to submit the Individual Subcontract Report and/or the Summary Subcontract Report using eSRS; (v) Provide the prime contract number, the order number, if applicable, and the prime contractor's DUNS number and to all first-tier subcontractors with subcontracting plans so they can enter this information into eSRS with their reports; and (vi) Ensure that all subcontractors with subcontracting plans under the flow-down requirements of subparagraph (d)(9) above, at every tier, provide the prime contract number, the order number, if applicable, and their own DUNS number to all of their subcontractors with subcontracting plans.

The records shall include at least the following (on a plantwide or company-wide basis, unless otherwise indicated): (i) Source lists (e.g., CCR's Dynamic Small Business Search function), guides, and other data that identify small business, veteran-owned small business, and service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. (ii) Organizations contacted in an attempt to locate sources that are small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concerns. (iii) Records on each subcontract solicitation resulting in an award of more than $100,000, indicating(A) Whether small business concerns were solicited and, if not, why not; (B) Whether veteran-owned small business concerns were solicited and, if not, why not; (C) Whether service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns were solicited and, if not, why not; (D) Whether HUBZone small business concerns were solicited and, if not, why not; (E) Whether small disadvantaged business concerns were solicited and, if not, why not; (F) Whether women-owned small business concerns were solicited and, if not, why not; and (G) If applicable, the reason award was not made to a small business concern. (iv) Records of any outreach efforts to contact(A) Trade associations; (B) Business development organizations; (C) Conferences and trade fairs to locate small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business sources; and (D) Veterans service organizations.

Section I

(A) Workshops, seminars, training, etc.; and (B) Monitoring performance to evaluate compliance with the program's requirements. (vi) On a contract-by-contract basis, records to support award data submitted by the offeror to the Government, including the name, address, and business size of each subcontractor. Contractors having commercial plans need not comply with this requirement. (e) In order to effectively implement this plan to the extent consistent with efficient contract performance, the Contractor shall perform the following functions: (1) Assist small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns by arranging solicitations, time for the preparation of bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules so as to facilitate the participation by such concerns. Where the Contractor's lists of potential small business, veteranowned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors are excessively long, reasonable effort shall be made to give all such small business concerns an opportunity to compete over a period of time. (2) Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women- owned small business concerns in all "make-or-buy" decisions. (3) Counsel and discuss subcontracting opportunities with representatives of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women- owned small business firms. (4) Confirm that a subcontractor representing itself as a HUBZone small business concern is identified as a certified HUBZone small business concern by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database or by contacting SBA. (5) Provide notice to subcontractors concerning penalties and remedies for misrepresentations of business status as small, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, or women-owned small business for the purpose of obtaining a subcontract that is to be included as part or all of a goal contained in the Contractor's subcontracting plan. (f) A master plan on a plant or division-wide basis that contains all the elements required by paragraph (d) of this clause, except goals, may be incorporated by reference as a part of the subcontracting plan required of the offeror by this clause; provided(1) The master plan has been approved; (2) The offeror ensures that the master plan is updated as necessary and provides copies of the approved master plan, including evidence of its approval, to the Contracting Officer; and (3) Goals and any deviations from the master plan deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to satisfy the requirements of this contract are set forth in the individual subcontracting plan. (g) A commercial plan is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial items. The commercial plan shall relate to the offeror's planned subcontracting generally, for both commercial and Government business, rather than solely to the Government contract. Commercial plans are also preferred for subcontractors that provide commercial items under a prime contract, whether or not the prime contractor is supplying a commercial item. (h) Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract. (i) The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith withI-8

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029

Section I

(1) The clause of this contract entitled "Utilization Of Small Business Concerns;" or (2) An approved plan required by this clause, shall be a material breach of the contract. (j) The Contractor shall submit the Individual Subcontract Report and the Summary Subcontract Report as described below using the web-based eSRS (http:www.esrs.gov). Neither report is required from small businesses. These reports collect subcontract award data from prime contractors/subcontractors that: (a) hold one or more contracts over $500,000 (over $1,000,000 for construction of a public facility); and (b) are required to report subcontracts awarded to Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), HUBZone Small Business (HUBZone SB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns under a subcontracting plan. Purchases from a corporation, company, or subdivision that is an affiliate of the prime/subcontractor are not included in these reports. Subcontract award data reported on these forms by prime contractors/subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate subcontractors. Credit cannot be taken for awards made to lower tier subcontractors: (1) Individual Subcontract Report. This report is not required for commercial subcontracting plans, except as noted below. The report is required for each contract containing a subcontracting plan and must be submitted to the Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) or Contracting Officer if no ACO is assigned, semi-annually during contract performance for the periods ended March 31 and September 30. A separate report is also required for each contract at contract completion. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. Reports are required when due, regardless of whether there has been any subcontracting activity since the inception of the contract or since the inception of the previous report. The authority to accept or reject the Individual Subcontract Report resides with: (A) In the case of the prime contractor, it resides with the Government agency responsible for administering the prime contract; and (B) In the case of a subcontractor with a subcontracting plan under the flow down requirements in subparagraph (d) (9) above, it resides with the prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor that awarded the subcontract. (2) Summary Subcontract Report. This report encompasses all of the contracts with the awarding agency. It must be submitted annually using eSRS for the twelve months ending September 30th, except for contracts covered by an approved commercial plan. If the reporting activity is covered by a commercial plan, the reporting activity must report annually using eSRS all subcontract awards under that plan. Reports for other than commercial plans are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period. Commercial plan reports are due 30 days after the end of the contractor's fiscal year for all Government contracts in effect during that period: (A) The report must be submitted on a corporate, company or subdivision (e.g. plant or division operating on a separate profit center basis), unless otherwise directed by the agency awarding the contract. If a prime contractor/subcontractor is performing work for more than one Federal agency, a separate report shall be submitted via eSRS to each agency covering only that agency's contracts, provided at least one of that agency's contracts is over $500,000 (over $1,000,000 for construction of a public facility) and contains a subcontracting plan; (B) The annual report submitted by organizations having an approved commercial plan shall include all subcontracting activity under commercial plans in effect during the year and shall be submitted in addition to the required reports for other-than-commercial plans, if any; (C) The authority to accept or reject Summary Subcontract Reports in eSRS, including Summary Subcontract Reports submitted by subcontractors with subcontracting plans under the flow-down requirements in subparagraph (d) (9) above, resides with the Government agency awarding the prime contract; however, the

I-9

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029

Section I

authority to accept or reject Summary Subcontract Reports for commercial plans resides with the Contracting Officer who approved the commercial plan; and (D) The contractor shall maintain a hard copy of the Summary Subcontract Report signed by its Chief Executive Officer on file for four (4) years from the end date of the reporting period. (3) Contractors with approved commercial plans who wish to take advantage of eSRS' lower-tier reporting capability may voluntarily submit the semi-annual Individual Subcontract Report for one or more contracts covered by their commercial plan and may require their other-than-small subcontractors to submit a semi-annual Individual Subcontract Report for the same contract(s). No Contracting Officer or other Government official shall require a contractor with an approved commercial plan to submit the semi-annual Individual Subcontract Report if the contractor does not wish to do so. (4) All reports submitted at the close of each fiscal year (both individual and commercial plans) shall include a breakout, using eSRS. of subcontract awards, in whole dollars, to small disadvantaged business concerns by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsector. eSRS will prompt contractors to submit this report when they complete their year-end Summary Subcontract Report, but it will allow them to submit it at a later date if the data is not available when the year-end Summary Subcontract Report is submitted. For a commercial plan, the Contractor may obtain from each of its subcontractors a predominant NAICS Industry Subsector and report all awards to that subcontractor under its predominant NAICS Industry Subsector. I.5 52.252-6 AUTHORIZED DEVIATIONS IN CLAUSES (APR 1984) (a) The use in this solicitation or contract of any Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" after the date of the clause.

(b) "Information Technology Resources" include, but are not limited to, computer equipment, networking equipment, telecommunications equipment, cabling, network drives, computer drives, network software, computer software, software programs, intranet sites, and internet sites. (c) Contractor employees working on this contract must complete such forms as may be necessary for security or other reasons, including the conduct of background investigations to determine suitability. Completed forms shall be submitted as directed by the Contracting Officer. Upon the Contracting Officer's request, the Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted, or subject to other investigations as required. All contractor employees requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information or IT resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this contract unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures. (d) The Contracting Officer may require the contractor to prohibit individuals from working on the contract if the government deems their initial or continued employment contrary to the public interest for any reason, including, but not limited to, carelessness, and insubordination, incompetence, or security concerns. (e) Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information. Therefore, the Contractor shall not disclose, orally or in writing, any sensitive information to any person unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer. For those contractor employees authorized access to sensitive information, the contractor shall ensure that these persons receive training concerning the protection and disclosure of sensitive information both during and after contract performance. (f) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all subcontracts at any tier where the subcontractor may have access to Government facilities, sensitive information, or resources. (g) Before receiving access to IT resources under this contract the individual must receive a security briefing, which the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will arrange, and complete any nondisclosure agreement furnished by DHS. (h) The contractor shall have access only to those areas of DHS information technology resources explicitly stated in this contract or approved by the COTR in writing as necessary for performance of the work under this contract. Any attempts by contractor personnel to gain access to any information technology resources not expressly authorized by the statement of work, other terms and conditions in this contract, or as approved in writing by the COTR, is strictly prohibited. In the event of violation of this provision, DHS will take appropriate actions with regard to the contract and the individual(s) involved.

Section I

(i) Contractor access to DHS networks from a remote location is a temporary privilege for mutual convenience while the contractor performs business for the DHS Component. It is not a right, a guarantee of access, a condition of the contract, or Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). (j) Contractor access will be terminated for unauthorized use. The contractor agrees to hold and save DHS harmless from any unauthorized use and agrees not to request additional time or money under the contract for any delays resulting from unauthorized use or access. (k) Non-U.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department IT systems under the contract, unless a waiver has been granted by the Head of the Component or designee, with the concurrence of both the Department's Chief Security Officer (CSO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or their designees. Within DHS Headquarters, the waiver may be granted only with the approval of both the CSO and the CIO or their designees. In order for a waiver to be granted: (1) The individual must be a legal permanent resident of the U.S. or a citizen of Ireland, Israel, the Republic of the Philippines, or any nation on the Allied Nations List maintained by the Department of State; (2) There must be a compelling reason for using this individual as opposed to a U.S. citizen; and (3) The waiver must be in the best interest of the Government. (l) Contractors shall identify in their proposals the names and citizenship of all non-U.S. citizens proposed to work under the contract. Any additions or deletions of non-U.S. citizens after contract award shall also be reported to the contracting officer. I.7 HSAR 3052.209-70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUL 2009) DEVIATION a) Except as provided (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.108-7004, DHS may not enter into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation under subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b), or any subsidiary of such entity. (b) Section 743 of Division D of the FY 2009 omnibus appropriations legislation (Pub. L. 111-8) prohibits the use of FY 2009 funds appropriated to DHS for contracting with any inverted domestic corporation. The same restriction is also contained in the FY 2008 omnibus appropriations legislation (Pub. L. 110-161, Section 745). The FAR implementation of Sections 743 and 745 will be relied upon instead of the HSAR implementation of 6 U.S.C. 395(b) for DHS contracts obligating funds available for FY 2008 and FY 2009, and for DHS contracts obligating future year funds, if the appropriations restriction is reenacted in the same form in subsequent fiscal years. DHS may not use any funds appropriated or otherwise made available FY 08 or FY 09 (or in a successor appropriation act, if the restriction is reenacted) for any Federal contract with a foreign incorporated entity, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation under subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act (6 U.S.C. 395(b)). (c) When Section 743 or a subsequent successor appropriation act with the contracting prohibition is in effect and implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 48 CFR 9.108, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations and the provision at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.209-2, Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations-Representation, the FAR prohibition and provision apply to DHS. (d) In the event that successor legislation is not enacted, DHS will be bound by provisions of HSAR 3009.108-70, et seq. and HSAR Clause 3052.209-70 in effect on June 30, 2009.

I.8 HSAR 3052.209-72 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (JUN 2006) (a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting; (1) If the Contractor, under the terms of this contract, or through the performance of tasks pursuant to this contract, is required to develop specifications or statements of work that are to be incorporated into a solicitation, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform the work described in that solicitation as a prime or first-tier subcontractor under an ensuing DHS contract. This restriction shall remain in effect for a reasonable time, as agreed to by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor, sufficient to avoid unfair competitive advantage or potential bias (this time shall in no case be less than the duration of the initial production contract).

(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.

(d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan. (e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict. (f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision. (g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.

For more information on FEMA's ADR services, please contact FEMA's ADR office at the following address: Federal Emergency Management Agency 500 C Street, S.W., PP 5th Floor Washington, DC 20472 If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency. These procedures have been designed to create an avenue for resolving third party grievances in connection with the acquisition process outside of formal processes through the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC). Filing an agency protest is not a prerequisite to filing at the GAO or CFC. If the protester files a protest through the GAO or CFC while their protest is pending at the agency level, FEMA may dismiss the agency protest. Pursuing an agency protest does not extend the time for obtaining a stay at GAO. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in FAR Subpart 33.103. B. Definitions. L-2

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029

Section L

(1) "Agency protest," as used in this SOP, is one that may be filed with either the Contracting Officer or the officer responsible for the resolution of all agency protests filed at the level above the Contracting Officer. (2) "Ombudsman," as used in this SOP, is the agency official above the level of the Contracting Officer designated by the Director of the Acquisition Management Division to handle and issue the formal agency decision resolving the protest. Protesters using these procedures may protest directly to the Ombudsman. (3) "Day," as used in this SOP, is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday. Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of FEMA are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Agency is open. C. Submission Guidelines. (1) Agency protests may be filed through the Contracting Officer or, at the level above the Contracting Officer, through the Ombudsman either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested) as follows: a. Protests filed through the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman must be mailed or faxed to: Federal Emergency Management Agency 500 C Street, S.W., PP 5th Floor Washington, DC 20472 b. The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency Protest". c. If the protester submits the protest directly through the Ombudsman, the protester must also, within one (1) day of submitting the protest to the Ombudsman, submit a copy of the protest to the responsible Contracting Officer either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested). (2) To be filed on a given day, protests and any subsequent appeals must be received by 4:30 PM, current-local time. Any protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day. (3) Protest submissions will not be considered filed until all of the following information is provided: a. the protester's name, address, telephone number and fax number; b. the solicitation or contract number; c. a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, to include an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced; d. copies of relevant documents; e. a request for ruling by the agency; f. a statement detailing the form of relief requested; g. all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purposes of filing a protest; and h. all information establishing the timeliness of the protest. (4) All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester, and must be addressed to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman. D. Timeliness/Resolution of Protests. (1) Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial solicitation but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation. (2) Protests other than those covered by paragraph (1) of this section shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known (whichever is earlier), with the exception of protests challenging a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested L-3

Section L

and, when requested, is required. In such cases, with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall not be filed before the debriefing date offered to the protester, but shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held. (3) Protests filed through the Contracting Officer. a. Within twenty (20) days after the protest is filed through the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Return Receipt Requested)". b. Appeals i. Protesters who filed protests through the Contracting Officer may, within five (5) days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's written ruling, appeal to the Ombudsman. ii. Requests for Appellate Review must be submitted to the Ombudsman by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested). iii. The Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within ten (10) days of receipt of the request for appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision. iv. In accordance with FAR 33.103(d)(4) and 4 C.F.R 21.2(a)(3), if there is an agency appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision on the protest, it will not extend GAO'S timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within ten (10) days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action. (4) Protests filed through the Ombudsman: a. If the protester protests directly through the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within thirty-five (35) days after the protest was filed. b. Protests filed directly through the Ombudsman cannot be appealed within the agency. E. Dismissal of Protests. The agency may dismiss protests when protesters file protests through the GAO or CFC while their protests are pending at the agency level; and for failure to comply with any of the requirements of these agency protest procedures. For example, the agency may dismiss protests that are procedurally or substantively defective (e.g., the protest is untimely or the protest fails to clearly state legally sufficient grounds of protest).

All information relating to the proposed cost/price, including all required supporting documentation, must be included in the selection of the proposal designated as the cost/price volume. Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal. For cost/price CLINs, the submitted data must include at least the following: A narrative on the basis of estimate (BOE) by cost element. (Specific requirements by cost elements are detailed below in paragraph 7.4) A statement as to the contractor's compliance with FAR 9.104-1 (General Standards for Responsible Prospective Contractors). Indication of the contractor's Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) status and status of any open CAS issues.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M.1 NOTICE LISTING SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE The following solicitation provisions pertinent to this section are hereby incorporated by reference (by Citation Number, Title, and Date) in accordance with the FAR provision at FAR "52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE" in Section L of this solicitation. See FAR 52.252-1 for an internet address (if specified) for electronic access to the full text of a provision.

NUMBER 52.217-5 3052.219-72

TITLE EVALUATION OF OPTIONS EVALUATION OF PRIME CONTRACTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE DHS MENTOR-PROTÉGÉ PROGRAM

DATE JUL 1990 JUN 2006

M.2 EVALUATION-GENERAL The Government will award the contract to the responsible Offeror whose acceptable offer represents the best value to the Government. The Government will only award one contract and will not award partial contracts. The ranges specified in Section B of this solicitation are necessary to allow the Government the flexibility to adjust quantities as mandated by the Congress or called for by budgetary constraints. All, some, or none of the options may be exercised by the Government in its sole discretion. Offerors are required to price out all Contract Line Items (CLINs) that are not categorized as NSP. All units of all items will be awarded to one Offeror. Offers, therefore, must be on the basis of furnishing all units of all items. Each Offeror shall submit only one proposal. The Government will not evaluate alternate proposals. The Government may conduct a Pre-Award Site Survey as part of this source selection. Results of any survey will be evaluated to determine each Offeror's capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation. Any such survey may also be used to verify statements and representations made in the Offeror's proposal. To be eligible for award, Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions and representations and certifications and to provide all information required by Section L of this solicitation. Failure to comply with all the solicitation requirements may result in the Offeror being removed from consideration for award. In accordance with FAR 52.215-1, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer determines them to be necessary. Failure to identify any dependency outside the scope of this procurement or any underlying assumptions critical to the performance of Cost and Schedule variables within the scope of this contract may result in the proposal being evaluated as "Unacceptable". Acceptability of the Offer The Government reserves the right to eliminate from competition any proposal determined to be unacceptable. To be acceptable, the offer must manifest the Offeror's assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the RFP, including all attachments. An "Unacceptable" rating for any factor will result in the entire proposal being found unacceptable. Offerors must propose costs for all base and option line items. M-1

Section M

The Factor Individual Rating Form provides the rating sheet to record all individual Evaluation Criteria strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies associated with each proposal. The Factor rating standards, established for this source selection, provide for the same set of values to be used by all evaluators arriving at their independent judgments. The rating standards coupled with the required written narrative of the strengths, weaknesses, and risks for each evaluation factor and proposal streamlines the evaluation process and simplifies the consensus phase of this evaluation. Thus, the overall source selection process becomes more objective, streamlined, uniform, and less time consuming. The adjectival rating scheme shown below will be used. Rating Excellent Abbreviation E Definition The response contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies or weaknesses. The Offeror demonstrates an excellent understanding of and superior ability to meet or exceed the factor and sub-factor requirements with low or no risk. The highest quality of contract performance is anticipated. The response contains some strengths but no deficiencies and only a few minor weaknesses. The Offeror demonstrates a solid understanding of and substantial ability to meet or exceed some of the factor or subfactor requirements with minimal risk. The response contains no deficiencies but some weaknesses. Strengths, if any, are offset by weaknesses. Based on the information provided, the Offeror demonstrates an ability to meet the factor or sub-factor requirements while introducing some risk. The response contains deficiencies and/or gross omissions; failure to understand much of the scope of work necessary to perform the required tasks; failure to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the government's requirements; failure to meet many personnel requirements in the solicitation; and/or introduces excessive risk.

Good

G

Acceptable

A

Unacceptable

U

Deficiencies and weaknesses are as defined below: Deficiencies--A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. (FAR 15.001) Weaknesses--A proposal flaw that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is considered a weakness. A "significant weakness" in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. (FAR 15.001) An unacceptable rating for any factor will result in an unacceptable rating for the proposal overall. M.3 EVALUATION FACTORS Five (5) factors will be used in the selection of Offerors. M-2

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029 ˇ ˇ

Section M

Evaluation Factors 1 through 5 are listed in descending order of importance. Sub factors within a Factor are of equal importance.

Factors 1 through 4 will be used in the evaluation of how Proposals and Final Revised Proposals address the Statement of Objectives. When combined, these factors are significantly more important than cost/price. Factor 1. Effective Customer Services, Data Services and Program Improvements Sub Factor A-Performance Work Statement (PWS) The Government will evaluate how the Offeror's proposed solution achieves effective customer services; develops and executes a comprehensive plan for managing, disseminating and evaluating the effectiveness of Risk MAP outreach, products and support; and delivers process and programmatic change management. Sub Factor B-Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) The Government will evaluate how the Offeror's proposed solution achieves effective data services; maintains a reliable, efficient and interoperable IT architecture and data management and delivery system; effectively maintains the datasets, systems and software that directly support the Risk MAP program; focuses on the usability of data, systems and software, maintains continuity of service; and integrates with and supports relevant FEMA and DHS data, IT and geospatial policies, programs and initiatives. Sub Factor C-Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) The Government will evaluate how the Offeror's proposed solution demonstrates the ability to translate business requirements into effective, innovative, timely and implementable solutions; addresses, validates, and anticipates Risk MAP partner, user, and stakeholder needs; and balances quality, reliability, performance, government requirements, innovation, efficiencies, and cost-savings to best achieve Risk MAP goals. Factor 2. Corporate Capability and Knowledge of Associated Programs Sub Factor A-Management Factor The Government will evaluate how the Offeror's proposed solution addresses the Offeror's customer and data services capability; demonstrates the capacity to handle customer and data services requirements and, effectively addresses client requirements. Sub Factor B-Program Management Plan The Government will evaluate how the Offeror's solution reflects their understanding of the Risk MAP program and policy impacts of other FEMA Programs that are closely related to and directly impact the Risk MAP program. These FEMA programs include, but are not limited to Dam Safety and the National Flood Insurance Program. Factor 3. Past Performance All sources of information (e.g., reference checks, FEMA's own experience, external contracting offices (both DHS and non-DHS), government past performance databases, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)) regarding past performance may also be considered. Past Performance is not limited to performance on Federal Government contracts, and may include performance on contracts with State and Local Governments and private entities. Sub Factor A-Demonstrated Capabilities

M-3

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029

Section M

The Government will evaluate the Offeror's demonstrated capabilities, knowledge and experience in achieving effective program management of projects similar in size, scope, contract type, and complexities of Risk MAP; (This Sub Factor will evaluate Prime Contractor, Partners and Principle members of Joint Ventures.) Sub Factor B-Work History The Government will evaluate proposed sub contractor's demonstrated capabilities, knowledge and experience in achieving effective program management of projects similar in size, scope, contract type, and complexities of Risk MAP. Sub Factor C-Self Assessment The Government will evaluate the Offeror's resilience, resourcefulness, and management determination to deliver on commitments. Factor 4. Qualifications of Key Personnel and Proposed Staffing Sub Factor A-Personnel (Staffing Plan) The Government will evaluate the qualifications; relevant experience; corporate position; and, degree of authority to be exercised over the contract of the Offeror's proposed Project Director and other Key Personnel. Sub factor B-Organization (Key Positions), Risk Management Plan and Transition Plan. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed staffing plan including number of personnel; labor categories; and, labor mix necessary to accomplish the objectives of the Program Management portion of the Risk MAP program. Sub factor C-Small Business Subcontracting Plan The Government will evaluate the Offeror's Small Business Utilization (Not applicable to Small Business Concern Offerors), the ability to achieve the small business goals in the small business plan provided. Factor 5. Cost/Price The Government will consider an Offeror's cost/price for all CLINs. In making an award decision, the Government will determine an evaluated price for each Offeror. For purposes of this solicitation, "evaluated price" will consist of the offered cost/price to the Government for all CLINs. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 52.215-1, the Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or sub-line items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more CLINs is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. Pertinent cost and pricing data will be used to arrive at the Government determination of the most probable price to be incurred. Award Fee Plan will be evaluated under Factor 5. M.4 SELECTION PROCEDURES A. Technical Proposal evaluation. 1. The Technical Proposal will be evaluated against evaluation criteria specified in section M.

Section M

2.

At the conclusion of the initial evaluation, the government intends to conduct discussions with those Offerors who are determined to be in the competitive range. The Business Proposal will be evaluated separately from technical factors to assess its reasonableness (based on competition); no adjective rating will be applied. The Business Proposal Cost/Price will also be used as an aid in determining the Offeror's understanding of the technical requirements of the solicitation. Offerors that are not included in the competitive range may, in writing, request either a pre-award (FAR 15.505) or post award (FAR 15.506) debriefing. Although the Government intends to make award after establishing a competitive range and conducting discussions with Offerors determined to be in the competitive range, Offerors are requested to initially submit proposals to the government on the most favorable terms both from a technical and cost/price standpoint. The government reserves the right to make award based on initial submissions without discussions. Offerors within the Competitive Range may be requested to respond to Government questions relative to the proposal. The questions asked of each offeror will be tailored to exploring strengths, weaknesses and risks of that individual Offeror's proposal. Responses to questions may be requested in writing or by face to face discussions with written follow-up and may require several sessions or rounds of questions. If face to face discussions are held, personnel requiring access to FEMA Headquarters must be identified no later than 24 hours prior to arrival. Notifications must be provided to Mr. Wayne Sok at wayne.sok@dhs.gov or 202-646-3361, at least 5 business days before the face to face session is scheduled. Attendees must have photo identification when they arrive. Upon completion of discussions, all Offerors in the Competitive range will be requested to submit a Final Proposal Revision, which will be evaluated against evaluation criteria in section M.

Business Proposal Evaluation. 1. Each business proposal will be read thoroughly so that the evaluator gains a complete understanding of what is being proposed and how each requirement is priced. Evaluators will take notes and write down questions as they review each proposal. The completeness and accuracy of cost information will be reviewed. A determination will be made as to whether each Offeror has properly understood the proposal instructions and properly completed the pricing schedule. Each Offeror's proposal will be checked for mathematical correctness. The price evaluation will consist of the Business Evaluation Committee's (BEC) analysis of the proposed prices to determine their reasonableness and cost realism. Additionally the BEC shall evaluate the following areas: ˇ Responsibility: There may be a direct connection between a low price and the M-5

2.

3. 4.

HSFEHQ-11-R-0029

Section M

Offeror's ability to perform. ˇ Understanding of the Requirement: The price may be very attractive because the vendor does not understand the contract requirements, or because it does not have the required expertise. Efficiency: Offerors providing the same services can have substantially different cost structures, even when they are providing the same services. Strategy: All Offerors have the same general pricing objectives which are to cover costs and contribute to attaining corporate operational objectives. However, differences in strategies and services may impact pricing. Mistakes: A simple mathematical error can have a significant effect on contract pricing. Even with computers, mistakes can still be made.

M.5 BASIS FOR AWARD After completing the evaluation of the Final Proposal revisions, the Government will make award to the responsive, responsible Offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. This is a best-value procurement. The Government may or may not award to the lowest priced offeror or highest technically rated Offeror. The Contracting Officer may reasonably determine that the superior solution merits a higher price and therefore represents the best value to the Government. Although the Government intends to make award after establishing a competitive range and conducting discussions with Offerors determined to be in the competitive range, Offerors are requested to initially submit proposals to the government on the most favorable terms both from a technical and cost/price standpoint. The government reserves the right to make award based on initial submissions without holding discussions. Offerors that are not selected for contract award may, in writing, request a post award (FAR 15.506) debriefing. M.6 NON-AGENCY EVALUATION SUPPORT The Government may use personnel from other Government agencies and/or contractor personnel in an advisory capacity to support the Government's evaluation of proposals and will be subject to the appropriate conflict of interest, standards of conduct, and confidentiality restrictions.

Risk MAP-Customer and Data Services ­ Questions & Answers
ˇ How important is price? In the issued solicitation price is significantly less important than the other factors, please verify this is not amended to make sure you are using the correct information. ˇ Are you looking for cutting edge innovation?

FEMA is looking for proven, but innovative, technology. ˇ No. ˇ What is program value? Are you looking for return on investment?

FEMA will not release the government estimate for the value of this contract. Due to the fact that the current budget has not passed, we can only estimate the program value, but the budget for FY 10 for Risk MAP was $300 million. ˇ Are the current IT systems and data, especially those used by the help desk/call center accessible by blind or visually impaired?

All externally facing systems are required to meet the requirements of Section 508. The government has not required the contractors' internal systems to meet requirements of the blind or visually impaired. ˇ Does FEMA have any work under Ability One?

Yes, but it is not expected to be used under this effort ˇ Why is this solicitation taking place now?

This is a follow-on contract; the current contract is ending this year. ˇ When will the contract be awarded?

Sometime during FY 2011. ˇ Who is the current PTS contractor?

RAMPP, STARR, and BakerAECOM are the PTS contractors. RAMPP and STARR are Joint Ventures. BakerAECOM is a Limited Liability Corporation. ˇ Who is the current PM contractor?

Attachment 2- Questions & Answers

Accenture. ˇ When do their contracts expire?

The PTS contracts expire March 2014 and the PM contract expires in December 2013 ˇ Yes. ˇ Will there be a purchase of Hardware and/or Software to support the CDS program this year? Is Zimmerman Associates, Inc. (ZAI) the current CDS contractor?

FEMA does not anticipate any needs for purchases, but the need could occur during technology refreshes. ˇ What is the current architecture MIP? Hardware, software, etc.

MIP architecture documents can be found on our Virtual Library under the A2 ­ IT Systems folder at http://virtuallibrary.sharepointspace.com/SitePages/Home.aspx. ˇ Are there any standards in database operating system, hardware, etc.

FEMA follows DHS technical reference model and all Federal technical standards. ˇ Is program being re-competed before the end of the current or predecessor program? If so, why?

FEMA assumes this question means CDS contract, not program. Yes it is being re-competed before the end of the current contract because FEMA does not want a gap in services. If we put the contract out for competition only after the current contract ends then we would have no services until the new contract was in place. If you mean is the current contract being ended early, no. The current contract will end as scheduled. ˇ Will Small Business, etc. be factors considered in the evaluation?

Small business sub-contracting goals are always considered. ˇ Can you elaborate on differences between current CDS Contract and the work to be done under the "new" CDS contract?

We do not see a reason to be concerned here with the differences, if any. Our goal is to get the services described in the issued solicitation. If there is a specific question or concern, please send us that. ˇ Why is the procurement compressed? (ie: Industry Day to Award is 4 mos!)

The acquisition timeline for this procurement is still under revision (at the time this question was submitted), and we are not sure where you received the information that this will be done in 4 months. However, this is not compressed; this is on a normal timeline for a FEMA acquisition.

Attachment 2- Questions & Answers

ˇ

Are the slides used in today's presentation in going to be made available?

Yes, the slides and questions/answers will be made available online. This question and answers refer to the presentation made at Industry Day. See the Industry Day folder at http://virtuallibrary.sharepointspace.com/SitePages/Home.aspx . ˇ Is the MSC a COCO facility?

The facility housing MSC is not government owned ˇ Please provide the rationale for combining an IT program and a map services program in one solicitation. Why is map services no longer a small business set-aside?

As the Risk MAP Program began in 2008, the Program identified the need to tightly integrate the customer services and related IT components of the Program to achieve the most efficient delivery of both the customer service and data services components of the Program. The current CDS contract is structured this way, and has supported the Program as intended. According to our records this work has never been a small business set-aside. ˇ Given the full breadth of CDS is NAICS Code 561422, as currently defined in FBO appropriate? Wouldn't 541513 or 541519 be more appropriate?

FedBizOpps will only allow one NAICS code to be posted, the one used is the code for what FEMA Acquisition believed was the largest percentage of the work; NAICS codes 541512 and 518210 also apply to this effort. Further analysis now leads us to believe that 541512 will encompass the largest part of the work under the contract. 541513 does not seem appropriate as facilities management is not a part of the requirement; 541519 may be appropriate as a catch-all for any IT service not captured under 541512 and 518210, but would represent a very small percentage of the contract. ˇ No. ˇ What is the estimated size of the call center? Is it anticipated that this solicitation will be small business set-aside?

Please clarify what you mean by size. ˇ Who currently operates the Call Center? Is it ZAI?

Yes, ZAI operates the call center. ˇ Do you have volumes, performance metrics you can share on the call center?

These are included in the RFP.

Attachment 2- Questions & Answers

ˇ

Does the call center need to be on a government site or remote?

The call center does not have to be on a government site. ˇ Is the call center operated 24/7/365? What are the hours of operation if not?

No, current hours of operation are: Monday-Friday, 8AM-6:30PM ET, self service options are available 24/7. The call center is closed Christmas, Christmas Eve, the day after Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving, July 4th and Labor Day. Pay close attention to the requirements shown in the solicitation. The information here is for the current contract and the requirement in the solicitation is different. ˇ Can this be released under FEMA COMMIT?

No, COMMIT does not cover all the work. ˇ Will non-citizens be allowed to work in CDS?

Yes, assuming they can work legally in the US. ˇ Currently, only citizens can work at DC2, but non-citizens can for development and test environments. Will there be any waivers?

A waiver process does exist, but FEMA does not control the waivers. ˇ Will we be given access to the SharePoint site mentioned in the Industry Day presentation (Virtual Library Link)?

Yes. The Virtual Library is located at: http://virtuallibrary.sharepointspace.com/SitePages/Home.aspx ˇ Who originated HAZUS?

FEMA. ˇ Who currently maintains HAZUS?

FEMA. ˇ Is there a requirement for the call center to be bilingual?

This is not a requirement under the issued solicitation. ˇ Is it FEMA's vision to maintain two Websites (i.e.: the MIP & MSC with FIRM data and backup data?

Not necessarily, but any data which is publicly accessible needs to remain publicly accessible. ˇ What, if any, organizational conflicts of interests are there with respect to providing services under the customer and data services contract? For PTS Teams? For the current ZAI team?

Attachment 2- Questions & Answers

OCI issues will only be addressed directly with entities that have, or believe they have, OCI problems. If you have a more specific question that may be properly addressed publicly, please submit it. ˇ What is FEMA's plan to make available existing products that were developed to CDS specifications?

Products developed or purchased by the CDS contractor and paid for by FEMA such as IT systems and applications; transferable software licenses; systems documentation; source code; data; maps; and outreach materials are considered FEMA property and can be made available at FEMA's discretion. Systems internal to CDS processes, such as production and back-office systems, may be considered proprietary and thus will not be made available by FEMA. ˇ Several questions that were received during Industry Day and since then assume the current contract was issued as a sole-source procurement, or challenge our statement (at Industry Day) that it was not a sole-source procurement.

The current contract was is a task order issued off of an already existing Blanket Purchase Agreement. We do not see how this affects the current full and open competition. This procurement will not be a limited competition or sole-source award. If there are any questions relating to the current procurement please submit them.

Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning (Risk MAP)
AWARD FEE PLAN XXXX XX, 2011 1.0 INTRODUCTION This Award Fee Plan will be used as the basis for the Customer and Data Services element of the Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning (Risk MAP) program evaluation of the Contractor's performance and for presenting an assessment of the Contractor's performance to the Fee Determining Official (FDO), and determining the amount of Award Fee to be payable to the Contractor. This Plan describes specific documents and procedures used to assess the Customer and Data Services Contractor's performance and to determine the amount of Award Fee earned. Actual Award Fee determinations are unilateral decisions made solely at the discretion of the Government. The total amount of the Award Fee for the base year shall be obligated at time of contract award. For each option year, the total amount of the Award Fee for that year shall be obligated at the time the option is exercised. The Contractor will be paid award fee upon determination, in writing, by the FDO. Award Fee earned and payable will be determined by the FDO based upon review of the Contractor's performance against the criteria set forth in this Award Fee Plan. 2.0 DEFINITIONS Award fee: An amount of money added to a contract, which a contractor may earn in whole or in part by meeting or exceeding the criteria stated in the Award Fee Plan. Award fee plan: The document that captures the award fee strategy. The plan details the procedures for implementing the award fee by structuring the methodology of evaluating the contractor's performance during each evaluation period. Award fee pool: The total of the available award fee for each evaluation period for the life of the contract. Award fee review board (AFRB): The AFRB evaluates the contractor's overall performance for the evaluation period in accordance with the Award Fee Plan. The board is comprised of Government personnel only whose experience in acquisition allows them to analyze and evaluate the contractor's overall performance. Base fee: An award-fee contract mechanism that is an amount of money over the estimated costs, which is fixed at the inception of the

Attachment 4- Award Fee Plan

contract and paid to the contractor regardless of performance in a cost-plus-award-fee contract. A base fee is similar to the fixed fee paid to a contractor under a cost-plus-fixed- fee contract that also does not vary with performance. Cost-plus-award-fee contract: A cost-reimbursement contract that provides for a fee consisting of a base amount (which may be zero) fixed at inception of the contract and an award amount, based upon a judgmental evaluation by the government in accordance with the Award Fee Plan, sufficient to provide motivation for excellence in contract performance. Cost-reimbursable contract: A contract that provides for payment of the contractor's allowable costs to the extent prescribed in the contract not to exceed a cost ceiling. Evaluation criteria: The criteria that are used to grade each category of performance. The criteria should emphasize the most important aspects of the program to facilitate the contractor doing its utmost to deliver outstanding performance. The criteria should be specific to the program and clearly stated in the contract. Evaluation period: The period of time upon which an award fee is based. This can be a specific increment of time (e.g., one year) or based upon the completion of an event (e.g., preliminary design review). An award fee amount is tied to each period of time or each event and the award fee board determines the appropriate fee for this period of time subject to approval by the fee determining official. Fee determining official (FDO): The FDO makes the final determination regarding the amount of award fee earned during the evaluation period by the contractor. Fixed-price contract: A contract that provides for a price that is either fixed or subject to adjustment obligating the contractor to complete work according to terms and for the government to pay the specified price regardless of the contractor's cost of performance Fixed-price-award-fee contract: A variation of the fixed-price contract in which the contractor is paid the fixed price and may be paid a subjectively determined award fee based on periodic evaluation of the contractor's performance. Reallocation: The process by which the Government moves a portion of the available award fee from one evaluation period to another for reasons such as Government-caused delays, special emphasis areas, and changes to the Performance Work Statement (PWS).

Attachment 4- Award Fee Plan

3.0 ORGANIZATION The Award Fee organization consists of: the FDO, an Award Fee Review Board (AFRB), and advisors. The AFRB consists of the Chairperson, the Contracting Officer (CO), the Risk Analysis Division (RAD) Deputy Director, the Program Coordination Lead (PCL), and Risk MAP CORs. Advisers to the CORs and the AFRB may be Program Area Managers (PAMs), RAD Branch Chiefs, Project Monitors, and Subject Area Experts, as necessary. The award fee organization is listed in Annex 1. The FDO will be the FEMA, Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA), RAD Director, or a more senior person with the Mitigation Directorate. The Chairperson of the AFRB will be the Risk MAP Chief Acquisition Coordinator (CHAIRPERSON), or a more senior person with the RAD. 3.0 RESPONSIBILITIES a. FEMA, FIMA Assistant Administrator. The Assistant Administrator appoints the FDO. b. FDO. The FDO approves the Award Fee Plan and any significant changes. The FDO reviews the recommendation(s) of the AFRB, considers all pertinent data, and determines the earned Award Fee amount for each evaluation period. Upon determining the amount of earned Award Fee, the FDO advises the CO, in writing of this decision and the amount of earned Award Fee. c. AFRB. AFRB members review the Contractor's performance, consider all information from pertinent sources, and arrive at an earned Award Fee recommendation to be presented to the FDO. The AFRB may also recommend changes to this plan. d. AFRB Chairperson. The Chairperson is responsible for oversight of the coordination of administrative actions conducted by the COR(s)/COTR(s) required by the AFRB and the FDO, including: l) receipt, processing and distribution of evaluation reports from all required sources; 2) scheduling and assisting with internal evaluation milestones, such as briefings; and 3) accomplishing other actions required to ensure the smooth operation of the Award Fee Process. e. COR(s). The COR is responsible for coordinating the administrative actions with the AFRB Chairperson that are required by the AFRB and

Attachment 4- Award Fee Plan

the FDO, including: l) receipt, processing and distribution of evaluation and performance reports from all required sources; 2) scheduling and assisting with internal evaluation milestones, such as briefings; and 3) accomplishing other actions required to ensure the smooth operation of the Award Fee process. f. CO. The CO is the liaison between Contractor and Government personnel. The CO participates as a voting member of the AFRB and, upon receipt of the FDO determination on earned Award Fee, the CO prepares the letter informing the Contractor of the earned Award Fee and authorizes the Contractor to invoice for this amount. g. Advisors. The Advisors are responsible for consultation with the CORs, the AFRB, and the FDO as needed (e.g. assist with briefing an award fee issue at an AFRB). Advisors will be asked to assist the CORs to evaluate the Contractors on the metrics as appropriate. 5.0 AWARD FEE PROCESS a. Contractor performance will be evaluated by the AFRB evaluation criteria included in this Award Fee Plan. If a survey is used to support part of the evaluation criteria, the survey may contain questions that are used for other purposes and not included as part of the performance assessment for Award Fee. b. Evaluation Criteria. The Evaluation Criteria to be used are described in Annex 3 of this document. Any changes to evaluation criteria will be made upon mutual agreement of the parties and formal written modification executed by the CO in accordance with Section 7.0. c. When a new task order is awarded by the FEMA HQ CO, a new Performance Work Statement (PWS), PRS, and Quality Assurance and Surveillance Plan (QASP) will be prepared, and a separate Award Fee pool will be established as negotiated between FEMA and the Contractor, as appropriate. d. During each Award Fee evaluation period, (e.g. quarterly) the Award Fee that is not earned does not remain in the Award Fee pool for subsequent evaluation periods during the life of that task order. e. The Chairperson establishes a date for the AFRB to meet. f. The Contractor's self-evaluation will be submitted to the CO and copied to the COR and CAC, within 15 business days after the last day of the evaluation period. The Contractor will brief the COR on its selfassessment as needed or requested. This written assessment of the

Attachment 4- Award Fee Plan

Contractor's performance throughout the evaluation period may also contain any information that may be reasonably expected to assist the AFRB in evaluating the Contractor's performance. The Contractor's self-assessment shall be limited to a maximum of 5 pages plus any supporting information as attachments. Before the Self-Assessment is submitted to the government, the Contractor may meet with the individual COR and appropriate PAMs to discuss preliminary Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) performance data. g. The COR will provide an assessment of the Contractor's performance along with the Contractor self-assessment to the CAC, within 15 calendar days of receiving the Contractor's self-assessment. h. The COR assessment will be a compilation of input from the FEMA staff selected to complete the Customer Satisfaction Survey. As a courtesy, the COR will provide the Contractor with a copy of the Government assessment of PRS metrics achievement. i. The AFRB then considers the Contractor's and Government's performance assessments, decides upon a recommendation to the FDO, and prepares a memorandum recommendation of earned Award Fee to be submitted to the FDO. If there is a difference in assessments between the Contractor and the COR, the COR will work with the Contractor, the CAC, the PCL, and PAMs to determine whether there is a need for clarification or if there is truly a difference of opinion that can not be resolved before the assessments are presented to the AFRB. If there remains a difference of opinion, it will be up to the AFRB to determine the final fee recommendation that will be provided to the FDO.

j.

k. The AFRB Chairperson briefs the evaluation recommendation to the FDO. l. At this time, the AFRB Chairperson, based upon recommendations from the AFRB, may also recommend any significant changes to the Award Fee Plan for FDO approval.

m. The FDO determines the overall performance level and earned Award Fee amount for the evaluation period within 60 calendar days after the evaluation period and in the case of a task order ending, 60 days after the end of the last task order performance period. n. If requested by the Contractor, the FDO will debrief the Contractor regarding the Award Fee determination.

After receiving the FDO's written determination, the CO shall inform the Contractor of the decision in writing. This letter shall also serve as authorization for the Contractor to invoice for the earned Award Fee. If the AFRB does not make a recommendation to the FDO within 90 days after receiving the Contractor's self assessment, the Contracting Officer may issue a letter authorizing the Contractor to bill for an amount equal to the lesser of: 1. 2. e. The amount of the Contractor's Self Assessment, or The amount due if performance was at the Acceptable level for all evaluation factors.
