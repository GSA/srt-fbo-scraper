ORDER TTB H 7100.1

Subject: To:

Systems Development Life Cycle Handbook

All Bureau Supervisors

1. Purpose. This Order authorizes the issuance of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Handbook (TTB H 7100.1), which establishes procedures to ensure that there are adequate management and control mechanisms during the life of information systems projects. The SDLC Handbook applies to all information systems developed, maintained, enhanced, and disposed of by TTB. 2. Effective Date. This Handbook is effective upon approval. 3. Authority. Section 1111(d) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Tax and Trade Bureau within the Department of the Treasury. Treasury Order No. 120-1 (Revised), dated January 24, 2003, designated the Tax and Trade Bureau as the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). It grants the Administrator full authority, powers, and duties to administer TTB affairs and to perform TTB functions, including, without limitation, all management and administrative authorities and responsibilities similarly granted and assigned to Bureau Heads or Heads of Bureaus in Treasury Orders and Treasury Directives. In addition to section 1512(a) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (the "savings clause"), this Handbook affirms and ratifies any action taken that is consistent with what is prescribed in this Handbook. 4. Background. Various federal laws and the increasingly complex nature of information technology (IT), with corresponding increases in resource investments and expenditures, require the establishment of capital planning and systems development guidelines. Guidelines ensure that such systems are developed, acquired, evaluated and maintained in an efficient manner within prescribed budget and schedule constraints and are responsive to mission requirements. Accordingly, the procedures in this SDLC Handbook ensure that there are adequate management and control mechanisms during the life of information systems projects.

APPENDIX V

While each phase of the SDLC applies to every project, the composition of products and activities within a phase will vary depending on the size and complexity of the project and the system's intended users. Objective The SDLC Handbook establishes the processes and procedures that the systems owners and TTB's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) will follow when initiating, developing, implementing, and maintaining information systems to support TTB's business processes as required by federal regulations. 5. Systems Development Life Cycle Handbook. This Order authorizes the Chief Information Officer to prescribe and publish the TTB Systems Development Life Cycle Handbook (TTB H 7100.1), which is issued as a separate directive and is binding on all TTB divisions. Any reference to this Order is deemed to include this Order and the Systems Development Life Cycle Handbook. Process. The SDLC Handbook: a. Describes a process for system owners, the Project Team, and oversight organizations to work together to bring an IT requirement from concept to fruition as a fully developed, documented, and functioning system. b. Provides a detailed step-by-step process with delineated roles and responsibilities for SDLC stakeholders and includes reference checklists and examples of SDLC documentation. c. Is instructional and directive. Sufficient background is provided so that the non-technical employee can understand what is required and why it is required. Regulatory requirements for SDLC processes and documentation are covered as well. Approach. a. Developing systems requires a consistent management approach and user involvement for structuring and controlling the process. The SDLC Handbook provides this approach and is developed to assist TTB personnel and contractors in producing quality systems from the beginning. b. The OCIO is responsible for managing the development and operation of information systems that improve service delivery to support the TTB business process, thereby reducing the burden on members of TTB's user communities and external customers, and for minimizing the cost of federal program administration. c. IT project sponsors and the OCIO must be able to link systems development projects to the Bureau's strategic plan and core business processes to justify expenditures. They must also ensure that system performance reviews are integrated with planning, that the 06/12/2007 ii

APPENDIX V

systems delivered provide value, and that the systems outcomes meet internal and external customer needs. Organization The SDLC Handbook is divided into 46 chapters, exhibits, and appendices. a. The first part contains the chapters that describe the SDLC processes from concept development through the seven phases of the SDLC. b. The second part contains the exhibits that are referenced in the document. c. The third part contains the appendices that provide additional SDLC information and reference material. Systems Development Life Cycle Phases a. There are seven SDLC phases described in the SDLC Handbook. Some projects may require merging some of the seven phases and not every project will require that the phases be sequentially executed. However, the phases are interdependent. Figure 1 (SDLC Life Cycle Phases) shows the relationship of the concept development and the seven life cycle phases. b. The SDLC model describes a full range of tasks and products that may be required for system development. All tasks and products may not be appropriate or cost-effective for every project. The model must be tailored to address the specific requirements of individual development projects. Large complex projects will require a broader range of activities and products than smaller or less complex systems. 6. Glossary. A Glossary of terms is located in Appendix A (GLOSSARY) of the SDLC Handbook. 7. Acronyms. A listing of acronyms and their meanings used throughout the SDLC Handbook is located in Appendix B (ACRONYMS) of the Handbook. 8. References. A listing of the various references associated with the SDLC Handbook is located in Appendix C (REFERENCES) of the Handbook.

Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Concept Development and Life-Cycle Phases

Deployment Phase Test Phase Development Phase Requirements Definition Phase
Analyzes user needs and develops user requirements. Creates a detailed requirements document. Defines inputs, processes, and outputs. Focuses on what functions must be delivered, rather than how they are delivered. Includes preparation and deployment of the system into a production environment, as well as resolution of problems identified in the implementation and user training on new systems.

Operations, Maintenance & Disposition Phase
Entails tasks for maintenance and operation of information systems in a production environment. Includes post deployment and periodic reviews. Describes end of system activities. Emphasis is given to proper preservation of data.

Design Phase
Transforms detailed requirements definitions into complete, detailed system specifications. Focuses on how to deliver the required functionality. Develops an external and internal design.

System Concept Development
Begins when a system sponsor/owner identifies a need or an opportunity to develop, enhance, or acquire an information system. Defines the business requirement or opportunity, linking it to specific enterprise missions. Includes a feasibility study and cost-benefit analysis. May result in an initiation of a project.

Planning Phase

Establishes a comprehensive model of the recommended approach to provide better project definition. Addresses the concept identified in the Concept Development phase, providing the basis for acquiring the resources needed to achieve a solution. Develops a project plan and other planning documents.

Converts a design into a complete information system. Includes the following activities: acquire and install systems environment; create and test databases/ prepare test case procedures; prepare test files; code, compile, refine programs; perform test readiness review and procurement activities. Also includes creation of the maintenance, user, and operators manuals, and the training, conversion, contingency, and deployment plans.

Demonstrates that the developed system conforms to requirements as specified in the requirements document. Conducted by the Quality Assurance staff and users. Also includes security testing and Test Analysis Reports.

Systems Development Life Cycle Handbook

CHAPTER A. GENERAL
1. BACKGROUND a. This chapter provides background information and an overview of specific concepts that are critical in the life cycle management process. The concepts exist throughout the life cycle for every system and are addressed in multiple phases. The concepts serve as the foundation for the life cycle management approach and are discussed in greater detail in the remaining chapters of the Handbook. b. The Bureau spends millions of dollars each year on the acquisition, design, development, deployment and maintenance of information systems vital to mission programs and administrative functions. There is an increasing dependence on computer systems and technology to provide services and develop products, support operations and users' business processes, and perform short-term and long-term management functions. As a result, the need for safe, secure, reliable, and accessible systems solutions is heightened. To ensure privacy and security when developing information systems, the Bureau must establish uniform privacy and security protection practices. Deployment strategies for these privacy and security practices must also be developed. c. The SDLC process describes a broad and diverse set of activities for addressing information systems requirements. The activities of the life cycle range from defining the requirements and selecting the solution, to developing, operating, and maintaining the systems solution. This Handbook is structured to provide a fair degree of flexibility in addressing those information systems requirements. This Handbook proscribes the lifecycle activities and deliverables for information technology initiatives. For software development and maintenance initiatives, this Handbook is supplemented by the TTB Software Management Handbook (scheduled to be published in January, 2007), which establishes TTB's software standards and best practices. d. Project Managers should consult with their OCIO staff representative, or as directed, other TTB representatives for guidance in modifying the life cycle to the needs of specific projects. All tasks and products may not be appropriate or cost-effective for every project. The model must be tailored to address the specific requirements of individual development projects. Large, complex projects will require a broader range of activities and products than smaller or less complex systems. 2. SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE BENEFITS a. This Handbook is a collection of industry best practices and organizational lessonslearned and is intended to help ensure that each information system project is successful. Specific benefits include: (1) Ensuring full consideration of the Bureau program environment, and associated system and data requirements from project initiation through the entire life cycle; (2) Providing early identification of technical, security, accessibility, and management issues to avoid investments of resources in impractical or unfeasible system features;

(3) Providing an early view of resource needs, including resources needed for out-year maintenance, to ensure that decisions regarding system capabilities consider the full cost of these capabilities, and refining this view throughout the life cycle; (4) Creating realistic expectations amongst the user community (Systems Owners and staff) of what the system will and will not accomplish; (5) Encouraging periodic evaluations to identify systems which may no longer efficiently and effectively support program needs or may have the potential to consume disproportionate resources in out-years; (6) Providing clear measures of progress and status to enable effective corrective action if needed; (7) Providing much of the information needed to support information management planning and the development of budget requests; and, (8) Providing the infrastructure and discipline necessary for a consistently successful software development process; (9) Ensuring that all systems development activities align with the Bureau's Target Enterprise Architecture and adhere to defined Capital Planning and Investment Control processes. b. This SDLC methodology provides a structured, proactive and disciplined approach to information systems projects that, if applied, should provide a consistently successful software development process. Such a process will avoid reactionary decision-making by ensuring a visionary tool for managers. Schedules and budgets are routinely exceeded because they are not based on realistic estimates. When hard deadlines are imposed, product functionality and quality are often compromised to meet the schedule. In this environment, there is no objective basis for judging product quality or for solving product or process problems. Therefore, product quality is difficult to predict. Activities intended to enhance quality such as reviews and testing are often curtailed or eliminated when projects fall behind schedule or when out-year budget baselines are exceeded. c. In this phase-based environment, managers are able to monitor the quality of the developed applications and the SDLC process that produced them. There is an objective quantitative basis for judging product quality and analyzing problems with the product and the SDLC process. Schedules and budgets are based on historical performance and are realistic. The expected results for cost, schedule, functionality, and quality of the product are usually achieved. In general, a disciplined SDLC process is consistently followed by the participants due to their understanding of the value of the infrastructure that exists to support the process. d. Systems that support Bureau programs vary in size and scope, complexity, and technologies used.

PURPOSE, SCOPE, AND APPLICABILITY This section explains the importance of life cycle management to all potential participants in the SDLC process and describes the progression of the life cycle through phases. This section outlines Bureau guidelines for the SDLC methodology and provides direction in its use and applicability. These guidelines apply to all Bureau employees and contractor personnel who are developing, acquiring or managing new systems or making significant or costly enhancements to existing systems, especially, mission critical systems; i.e., those systems that are indispensable to the daily operations of the Bureau. Adherence to the life cycle methodology by systems owners and all levels of management is required in order to implement effective information systems. Users and readers may identify recommended modifications to this Handbook and associated documentation. Proposed changes to this Handbook should be forwarded to the Enterprise Change Control Board by submitting a Request for Change (RFC).

4.

DOCUMENTATION a. The SDLC documentation is typically referred to as "deliverables" in the statement of work (SOW). Deliverables are collected at the end of each phase and stored in the project file. Very few of these deliverables remain unchanged throughout the systems life cycle. Some deliverables evolve continuously during the life cycle and others are revised to reflect the results of analyses performed in later phases. Deliverables are typically categorized into two major types - process and product. Depending on the size, scope, and complexity of the systems development effort, other types of deliverables may be added, e.g., technical. b. The life cycle methodology specifies which type of documentation will be generated during each phase. Some analytic methodologies or tools provide documentation or other output corresponding to all or part of a life cycle product. In these cases, these outputs can be used to satisfy the corresponding documentation requirements. Many of the products may serve as the basis for the Bureau information collection requirements, e.g., feasibility study, systems security plan, data dictionaries, systems of records notification, reports on excess personal property, equipment inventories, post deployment reviews, and cost-benefit analysis. c. Process documentation is necessary to communicate status and direction. By reviewing this documentation, systems owners are able to determine if needs are being understood and addressed and management is able to verify whether appropriate progress is being made during the development process. Examples include: (1) All project plans; (2) Project review reports; (3) Schedules and budgets; and, (4) Supporting materials.

d. Process documentation addresses the actions required for developing, implementing, and maintaining the system, i.e., the procedures, timelines, and funds required for accomplishing results. Where process documentation is not maintained, i.e., kept current subsequent to deployment, it should be retained for evaluation and general reference. Refer to each phase for additional process documentation. e. Product documentation should be retained and maintained in a current condition subsequent to deployment in order to communicate how the system operates to people who may not have been a part of the development process. These are users, reviewers, operators and maintenance providers, and programmer analysts. Some examples include, but are not limited to: (1) User manual; (2) Maintenance manual; (3) Test plan; (4) Risk assessment; (5) Systems security plan; and, (6) Conversion plan. f. Product documentation describes the system (i.e., What is it? How is it operated? How is it maintained?). The documents describe how the system processes data. These documents are maintained subsequent to installation. Modifications to the system as they occur are appropriately reflected in the documents. New versions of documents are distributed periodically. Each phase generates document deliverables.

g. Product deliverables require the approval of project stakeholders. Approval is documented by signing a Deliverable Product Acceptance Form (DPAF). See the TTB CM Handbook for the DPAF template. See Exhibit 29 for the signatories required vary by deliverable.

5.

DATA MANAGEMENT a. TTB's SDLC emphasizes management of data resources. Because of the large volumes of data handled by Bureau systems and the increasing trend toward sharing data across systems and programs, a data management approach is required when developing information systems. b. Data related to activities, products, and decisions that must be addressed during the system life cycle constitute the data management approach. The approach also includes the degree of rigor to be followed when performing these activities and the level of formality to be used when documenting data-related life cycle products and decisions. c. Implementing a data management approach is key to the success of the project. If the approach does not address data dictionary issues as part of a large, high impact project,

Systems Development Life Cycle Handbook

the risk of time and cost overruns for the project will be increased, as will maintenance costs for the completed system and its data. d. Data management starts early in the SDLC with the development of data requirements. Further planning includes developing a data migration plan and a test plan for data validation. e. One criterion that is a major factor in determining the data management approach is the degree of integration. Data integration encompasses the use of common data elements and the sharing of one system's data with other systems. Integrated databases and common data elements are essential requirements for an effective data management/integration program. A Bureau-wide data integration approach minimizes unexpected adverse impacts on systems and the business programs that the systems support. f. Benefits of data management include: (1) Ensuring that data collected and disseminated fully meet program requirements, including requirements for security, privacy, accuracy and timeliness; (2) Improving management decision-making by providing better access to more accurate and timely data; (3) Increasing productivity in the information collection and processing activities as the understanding and use of available data increases; (4) Ensuring that existing data can be shared thereby avoiding the cost of redundant data collection and storage; (5) Reducing the cost of systems maintenance and the time needed to modify implemented systems by designing more stable and flexible databases; (6) Maintaining data integrity; and, (7) Recognizing the sensitivity of the Bureau's data. g. Important aspects of data management are: (1) A Bureau-wide data dictionary is mandatory for effective data integration. A data dictionary must be prepared for every system. Each data dictionary must conform to the Bureau-wide data dictionary to clearly communicate the attributes of the data processed by the system to all users. (2) Data administration concerns cut across multiple systems. For each project, data administration focuses on the relationship of the project to other projects and systems that process common data. Data administration addresses data definitions, data standards, and mechanisms to ensure consistency of data across systems, data quality control procedures, and related issues that cut across project and systems boundaries.

LIFE CYCLE REVIEWS a. The life cycle review process consists of a series of reviews conducted in each phase to ensure that each phase of the project is completed successfully. This life cycle review process ensures that all products created during the life cycle meet functional and performance requirements as outlined in the requirements documentation. The requirements for holding specific reviews are determined by the system size and complexity and by management direction. b. Reviews will be conducted at the completion of each phase. The purpose of a review is to: (1) Ensure that project direction and goals remain consistent with the organization's strategic (business) plan and goals; (2) Provide an evaluative process and opportunity to justify termination of projects which fail to demonstrate an adequate return on investment; (3) Measure the ongoing progress (i.e., budget, schedule and deliverables) and identify potential problems for corrective actions; and, (4) Approve phase results and authorize further work.

Table 1 displays the seven SDLC phases and their associated reviews and tests.

c. Remember each purpose during the review process and achieve each purpose before terminating the review. The appropriate personnel for the review team are defined in the project management plan. Review team members can include the systems developer, user(s), data manager, database administrator, quality assurance manager, security manager, network administrator/manager, and configuration manager, as appropriate. In general, senior management involvement is greatest in the earlier phases of systems development efforts. This involvement declines in the later, more technical phases or less critical projects involving fewer resources. d. The Issues Checklist for each phase provides useful information to assist the review team. A Review Checklist for each phase is also provided and may be useful when conducting reviews. These checklists may be modified as appropriate for the systems development effort.

7.

TEST ACTIVITIES a. The goal of testing is to confirm that both individual system modules and the entire system are executed per the functional requirements and technical specification. The following types of test activities are identified more specifically in the testing phase of the life cycle and are included in the test plan and test analysis report. Types of testing include the following: 1) Unit/Module Testing is performed in the development phase by the systems development team. It consists of module/program level testing by validating the module's logic, adherence to functional requirements, and adherence to technical

specifications. Tests should be performed that include expected inputs and outputs, as well as, unexpected inputs and appropriate outputs (error messages). 2) Subsystem Integration Testing (SIT) is conducted in the development phase by the system development team. It tests the system's integrated groupings of software units and modules, otherwise known as subsystems. 3) End-to-End Testing (ETET) is a test conducted by the project team to ensure that systems capabilities are functional before the user conducts acceptance testing. During this test, the software performance, response time, and ability to operate under stressed conditions are tested as well as accessibility to individuals with disabilities. 4) User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a test by the user of every system feature for correctness and conformance to requirements. The OCIO Representative and Project Manager will determine the testing platform, but in general, the platform should approximate the operational environment as much as possible. Systems interoperability, documentation, systems reliability, and the level of which the system meets user requirements will be evaluated. Recovery and restart procedures may be evaluated. 5) Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Testing is conducted by an organization that did not develop the system, using a hardware/software platform that mirrors the proposed production environment as much as practicable and occurs in a controlled environment. IV&V is the ability to independently verify and validate that the processes used by the development team, and the products produced by the processes, are complete, correct, and ready for implementation into a production environment. IV&V ensures that products of each phase of the SDLC are fulfilled and the final system or component complies with the specified requirements. If the IV&V manager determines that IV&V Testing will occur, the tests will occur after Endto-End Testing and may be conducted concurrently with User Acceptance Testing. This test is a comprehensive verification and validation process conducted to ensure that all capabilities and requirements of the system perform as required per the approved requirement document. System documents and training plans are tested for accuracy, validity, completeness, and usability. During this test, the software performance, response time, and ability to operate under stressed conditions may also be tested. 6) Security Testing & Evaluation (ST&E) is performed in an environment that mirrors the proposed production environment as much as practicable. Security testing evaluates compliance with security and data integrity guidelines. It addresses security backup, recovery, and audit trails. It ensures that all security measures have been properly implemented in the operating environment and are effective to satisfy security requirements. It addresses all aspects of security to include internal controls, hardware, software and communications security controls, physical and environmental security, administrative procedural security requirements, etc. An ST&E Plan is developed with procedures to test all security controls. Results are documented in the final ST&E Report.

QUALITY ASSURANCE a. Quality Assurance (QA) places emphasis on identifying and recording design and programming discrepancies as early as possible in the development process in order to prevent more costly error corrections later. QA embodies the major elements of testing, system evaluation, and configuration management, in addition to specific mechanisms for QA monitoring throughout the system development project. b. The specific QA mechanisms used are technical reviews or walk-through and formal QA reviews. In the walk-through, a team consisting of functional and technical experts is assembled to examine products of the life cycle for correctness and technical quality. The QA review is a management level review conducted to ensure that methods and standards have been observed which comply with the Bureau's QA goals. c. Formal inspections throughout the life cycle have proven to be the largest return on investment for any quality assurance technique available within the software development industry. It is a proactive approach to error detection and resolution and it has the added benefit of increasing communication and learning.

9.

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT a. Configuration management provides a set of tools and procedures to control changes to a system and its SDLC documentation after life cycle activities have begun. Configuration management also controls the establishment and maintenance of production, testing, training, and development libraries. b. Configuration management provides the functional and physical characteristics of hardware and software as specified in the technical documentation and achieved in the end product. c. Objectives of configuration management are: (1) To provide a method to ensure the functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software are identical as specified in the technical documentation and achieved in the end product; (2) To identify and control changes to the functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software; (3) To provide a method for formal evaluation of the impact of proposed changes to the functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software; (4) To provide reports of the status of the functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software; (5) To establish an open path of communication for all parties affected by changes; and, (6) To identify, establish, and control configuration baselines (hardware, software, and SDLC documentation).

d. Functions of configuration management include: (1) Identification, which is selecting and labeling all functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software; (2) Control, which is the evaluation, coordination, approval, and deployment of all approved changes to the contents of an established configuration baseline, i.e., the initial functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software; (3) Accounting, which provides the administrative support required for maintaining system baselines and monitoring the status of the system throughout the life cycle as well as recording and reporting the information that is needed to manage effectively the functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software; and, (4) Audit, by which the configuration records are examined in order to verify the success of the change control and identification processes. 10. PRIVACY ACT CONSIDERATIONS a. Federal employees are guarded against unwarranted invasion of privacy through the misuse of personal records by federal agencies by restricting disclosure of such records and databases maintained by agencies. The Project Manager is responsible for ensuring that the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (PL 93-579) and the Computer Matching and Privacy Act of 1988 (PL 100-503) are addressed in the SDLC. Contacting the Privacy Act/Disclosure representative, Regulations and Rulings Division, in the planning phase will ensure compliance with requirements of both acts throughout the SDLC. b. Three main Privacy Act issues may pertain to the development of a computer system: (1) The Project Manager will work with the Regulations and Rulings Division to determine whether a Privacy Act notice or amendment to an existing Privacy Act notice is required to be incorporated into the system to advise users of their rights and responsibilities pertaining to the Privacy Act. (2) For any collection of personal information, the Project Manager will consult the Regulations and Rulings Division to determine if a Privacy Act Statement is needed. The Regulations and Rulings Division will help prepare a Privacy Act Statement that addresses the following: (a) Specific authority for the collection of the information (e.g., statute or executive order) and whether it is voluntary or mandatory that the individual provide the information; (b) The principle purpose or purposes for which the collected information will be used; (c) The routine use(s) of the collected information; and,

Systems Development Life Cycle Handbook

(d) The effects on the person from whom the information is to be collected for not providing all or any part of the information. (3) If the computer system is web-based and for public access, the Project Manager will work with the Regulations and Rulings Division to ensure adherence to the Office of Management and Budget requirements for privacy policies on federal web sites. 11. DISCLOSURE OF TAX RETURN INFORMATION a. OCIO acknowledges that when initiating, developing, implementing, and maintaining information systems to support TTB's business processes as required by federal regulations, project managers may have access to confidential tax return information. Under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, "tax return information" includes a taxpayer's name, address, other identifying information, and financial and operational data. Penalties for the unauthorized disclosure of return information are enumerated in 26 U.S.C. 7213. b. At the earliest stage of information systems development, the Project Manager will work with the Regulations and Rulings Division and the Office of the Chief Counsel to determine whether safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure of tax return information must be established in the event the Project Manager believes that such information system, when implemented, may contain tax return information. 12. REHABILITATION ACT CONSIDERATIONS a. The Rehabilitation Act of 1993 as amended (PL 106-246) provides federal employees equal access similar to that required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (PL 101-336). The recently implemented Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires accessibility (for a more detailed definition, please see Appendix A, glossary terms "Accessibility" and "Assistive technology") to electronic and information technology and provides for the implementation of technical standards when Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) is developed, procured, used, or maintained. The Project Manager is responsible for ensuring that the standards for EIT accessibility are addressed in the SDLC. 13. SECURITY a. To protect the Bureau's numerous and valuable systems resources, effective security policies and procedures must be developed and implemented. The security policies and procedures put into place by the Bureau must be followed. The primary purpose of these policies and procedures is to provide a level of security commensurate with the value of the asset being protected. These security policies and procedures include but are not limited to industrial, systems, data communications, technical, personnel, and physical security requirements. b. The Federal Information Security Act of 2002 (FISMA) is a United States law enacted in 2002 as Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002. The act was put in place in order to improve the security of operations and information, largely computer based, in federal civilian agencies. The primary objective of this Act is controlling unauthorized use of the

Systems Development Life Cycle Handbook

information in federal computer systems, rather than merely protecting the computer systems. FISMA imposes a mandatory set of processes that must be followed for all information systems used or operated by a US Government federal agency or by a contractor or other organization on behalf of a US Government agency. These processes must follow a combination of Federal Information Processing standards (FIPS) documents, the special publications SP-800 series issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and other legislation pertinent to federal information systems, such as the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. c. The Act specifies eight major requirements for system categorization and improving the security and privacy of sensitive information in federal computer systems. To establish minimum acceptable security practices, agencies are required to: (1) The first step is determining what constitutes an "information system." There is no direct mapping of computers to information system; but rather an information system can be a collection of individual computers put to a common purpose and managed by the same system owner. NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-18 provides guidance on determining system boundaries; (2) The next step is to determine the information types resident in the system and categorize each according to the magnitude of harm resulting were the system to suffer a compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability. NIST SP 800-60 provides a catalog of information types, and FIPS-199 provides a rating methodology and a definition of the three criteria. The overall FIPS-199 system categorization is the high water mark of the impact rating of all the criteria of all information types resident in the system; (3) If the system in question is in the design or implementation life-cycle phase, a set of security controls must be selected and incorporated into the system implementation. NIST SP 800-53a provides a catalog of controls, and the annexes to SP 800-53a provide a minimum control baseline for each FIPS-199 categorization level. Additionally, TTB maintains a list of Baseline Security Requirements Matrix derived from the SP 800-53a; (4) Pertinent system information such as system boundaries, information types, constituent components, responsible individuals, description of user communities, interconnections with other systems and implementation details for each security control need to be documented in the system security plan. NIST SP 800-18 Rev 1 gives guidance on documentation standards. Additional documentation such as a contingency plan for the system also needs to be prepared at this stage. Guidance on contingency planning can be found in NIST SP 800-34; (5) Once the controls implementation are documented, a risk assessment can be performed. A risk assessments starts by identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities, and maps implemented controls to individual vulnerabilities. One then determines risk by calculating the likelihood and impact of any given vulnerability being exploited, taking into account existing controls. The culmination of the risk assessment shows the calculated risk for all vulnerabilities, and describes whether the risk is to accepted or mitigated. If mitigated, one needs to describe what

additional SP 800-53 controls will be added to the system. NIST SP 800-30 provides guidance on the risk assessment process; (6) After the system documentation and risk assessment is complete, the system needs to have its controls assessed and certified to be functioning appropriately. For systems with a FIPS-199 categorization of Low, a self assessment is sufficient for certification. For systems categorized at higher FIPS-199 levels, a certification performed by an independent 3rd party is required. NIST SP 800-26 provides guidance on the self assessment process. NIST SP 800-53A provides guidance on the assessment methods applicable to individual controls; (7) Once a system has been certified, the security documentation package is reviewed by an accrediting official, who, if satisfied with the documentation and the results of certification, accredits the system by issuing an authorization to operate. This authorization is usually for a 3 year period, and may be contingent on additional controls or processes being implemented. NIST SP 800-37 provides guidance on the certification and accreditation of systems. (8) All accredited systems are required to monitor a selected set of security controls for efficacy, and the system documentation is updated to reflect changes and modifications to the system. Significant changes to the security profile of the system should trigger an updated risk assessment, and controls that are significantly modified may need to be re-certified. Guidance on continuous monitoring can be found in NIST SP 800-37 and SP 800-53A. d. These security requirements need to be incorporated into the system development project at the beginning. All Bureau systems maintaining sensitive information are required to have a system security plan. e. Appendix III to OMB Circular A-130 contains additional guidance on the "Security of federal Automated Information Systems." Appendix III requires the establishment of security controls in all general support systems, under the presumption that all contain some sensitive information, and focuses extra security controls on a limited number of particularly high-risk or major applications. f. Applications designated as major applications require that a risk assessment and system security plan be prepared. Appendix III of OMB Circular A-130 provides information on application rules, specialized training, personnel security, contingency planning, technical controls, information sharing, and public access controls.

g. TD P 85-01, the Treasury Information Technology Security Program, requires that bureaus maintain current Certification and Accreditations (C&A) for all Major Information Systems. If an information system is not classified as a Major Information System, but rather a Minor Application, it also must undergo a C&A, unless it derives all or most of its security controls from a Parent Application which has already undergone a C&A. h. The Project Manager ensures that all security requirements, including personnel and physical security, are coordinated with TTB's ISSO. These security requirements are incorporated in the planning phase and are continued throughout the SDLC. The project

charter, project management plan, and work breakdown structure (WBS), should identify: (1) How and when the security requirements will be identified, defined, and refined; (2) The security safeguards development efforts required during the project's design phase; (3) The testing criteria, development, and deployment efforts required during the design and testing phases; and, (4) The accreditation and certification efforts required during acceptance testing and prior to deployment into a production environment. i. The Bureau is required by government-wide regulations to protect its automated information system resources from potential threats by identifying safeguards through vulnerability and risk assessment. The safeguards become the security requirements and considerations that are associated with the development and deployment of new or enhanced applications software, hardware, peripheral equipment, or other information systems technology. The development of security safeguards is an integral part of the SDLC methodology and is inherent in each phase of the life cycle. PROJECT SCHEDULING TECHNIQUES a. The need to establish a realistic schedule is essential to the successful management of the deployment of any system project. The schedule is based on the tasks and activities of each phase and is incorporated into the project management plan. Initially, the schedule is one of the more important tools used in the cost analysis of established expected project outcomes. During the life of the project, the schedule is used as a basis for measuring progress throughout the process of creating and implementing the system. b. Schedules developed during a project are important to the management of the project. Resource allocation also uses the schedule as important input. The schedule established in the project management plan is used as the primary measure for progress reporting. The most accurate possible schedule is important to the successful completion of the project. c. Two types of project scheduling techniques are described below: (1) Top-down project scheduling occurs when predetermined boundaries or deadlines have been established and the Project Manager and/or OCIO Representative is required to meet them. This method produces a highly ambitious schedule that incorporates realistic and attainable outcomes. The Project Manager and/or OCIO Representative must focus the schedule on the work to be performed and must support and present the most accurate schedule possible and not necessarily the quickest or cheapest. (2) Bottom-up project scheduling breaks a project into its component tasks, determines the time requirements for each task and totals the components to determine an

estimated completion date for the project. Because it is easier to make more accurate estimates of smaller work units, the bottom up approaches are generally more accurate than the top-down technique. The most common bottom-up approaches are described below: (a) Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) analysis illustrates the relationship between tasks and produces PERT charts as its output. PERT networks are composed of events and activities. An event is defined as the starting or ending point for a group of activities. An activity is the work required to be accomplished in order to move from one event or point in time to another. PERT has several distinguishing characteristics. 1 It forms the basis for all planning and predicting; provides management with the ability to plan for the best possible use of resources to achieve a given goal within time and cost limitations; It provides visibility and enables management to control "one-of-a-kind" programs as opposed to repetitive situations; It helps management handle the uncertainties involved in programs by answering such questions as to how time delays in certain elements influence project completion, where slack exists between elements, and what elements are crucial to meet the completion date. This provides management with a means for evaluating alternatives; It provides a basis for obtaining the necessary facts for decision-making; It uses a time network analysis as the basic method to determine manpower, material, and capital requirements as well as provides a means for checking progress; and, It provides the basic structure for reporting information.

(b) Critical Path Method (CPM) analysis permits management to determine the set of all jobs in the project, which if delayed or extended, would affect the project completion date. Critical path and slack times are computed. The critical path is that sequence of activities and events whose accomplishment will require the greatest expected time. The critical path is vital for successful control of the project because it tells management two things: 1 Because there is no slack time in any of the events on this path, any slippage will cause a corresponding slippage in the end-date of the program unless this slippage can be recovered during any of the upstream events (on the critical path); and, Because the events on this path are the most critical for the success of the project, management must fully evaluate these events in order to improve the total program.

(c) Network Diagrams graphically illustrate relationships between tasks within a project and their dependencies, which may affect schedule or resource requirements. Within the life cycle, network diagrams are used to model the relationship of each task in a project to all tasks within that project; model the flow of a project's work from start to finish; and, help to determine the shortest time necessary to complete the project. The primary purpose of network planning is to eliminate the need for crisis management by providing a pictorial representation of the total program. The following management information can be obtained from such a representation: 1 2 3 4 Impact of late starts; Impact of early starts; Cost of a complete program failure; and, Slippage in planning.

(d) Bar (Gantt) Charts are a means of displaying activities or events plotted against time or dollars. An activity represents the work required to proceed from one point in time to another. Events are the starting or ending point for either one or several activities. Bar charts are most commonly used for exhibiting program progress or defining specific work required to accomplish an objective. Bar charts often include such items as activities, activity duration, schedule dates, and progress to date. The bar chart provides only a vague description of how the entire project reacts as a system. (e) Automated Methods are becoming easier to use and various software packages exist to assist in scheduling very large projects. For example, Microsoft Project is the Bureau's standard tool for project scheduling. An automated methodology is used when a large project is undertaken and many of the methodologies use some variation of PERT or CPM. Additional information on automated tools is included at Appendix D (Automated Tools). Application of systems analysis, design, and/or development tools will tend to reduce the duration of the activities in which they are used. Certain methodologies and tools, such as those associated with program code generators, will also tend to alter the relative duration of different activities. Automated project management can provide answers to such questions as: 1 2 3 4 5

How will limited resources impact the project? How will the project be impacted by a change in the requirements? What is the cash flow for the project and for each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) element? What is the impact of overtime and costs? What additional resources are needed to meet the constraints of the project?

How will a change in the priority of a certain WBS element affect the total project?

MANAGING THE LIFE CYCLE a. The SDLC methodology ensures that all information systems proceed through a series of phases during their existence. The methodology refers to this as "management of the system life cycle" and every information system normally follows the same pattern of evolution. b. The methodology segments the total process into a series of distinct phases in order to facilitate management of the process. Information systems projects are generally viewed in terms of the same standard phases. c. Systems generally proceed sequentially through these phases. The end of each phase corresponds to a logical milestone in the system life cycle. Each succeeding phase builds on the activities of the preceding phase, increasing what is known about the intended system. d. Just as the project is divided into phases to enhance control, each phase may be divided into smaller work units. This is appropriate whenever a phase becomes difficult to manage as a whole due to its size, complexity, or the number of personnel involved. e. In any specific project, this subdivision of work should proceed until units of work result that can be accomplished in a short period of time. On some projects, subdivision below the phase level may not be necessary. On very large development efforts, further subdivision of activities may be required. Operational control is achieved by dividing projects into smaller work units. Advantages include: (1) Improved estimates. A more accurate time and cost estimate can be achieved by dividing the project into a number of smaller work units. This is achieved both by reducing the amount of uncertainty contained in any single work unit and by averaging high and low estimates through aggregation. When projects are being contracted out, relatively small work units will facilitate monitoring the contract. (2) Improved communications. Smaller, less complex units of work can be communicated from Project Manager to team member with less confusion. Progress can be measured frequently and problems quickly identified. (3) Enhanced control. Progress measurement and communication are difficult in large projects. Segmenting a phase into manageable work units enables the Project Manager to meaningfully track and effectively communicate progress. (4) Increased flexibility of phase activities. Division of phases into smaller work units enables some degree of overlap of phase activities, thus enabling a more efficient use of available resources. For example, If the design of a particular system module were complete and approved, the project team may optionally authorize the development of that module to begin while the design for the rest of the system modules is completed.

MANAGING RISK a. General. Since every IT endeavor involves some element of risk, it is an appropriate management activity to search, acknowledge, and minimize where a project may be at risk in such areas as non-conforming products, specification noncompliance, technology failure, cost overrun, schedule slippage, etc. The SDLC methodology can help management minimize risk as described in the following paragraphs. b. Optimizing the Investment Decision. Early phases and tasks of a project account for a relatively small percentage of the total cost. Consequently, if projects are to be abandoned, it is during the early phases that this should happen in order to minimize loss. Using the phase and task structure of the SDLC, senior management can most effectively make a go/no-go decision. Thus, the SDLC methodology assists senior management in controlling risk and making good investment decisions without experiencing major losses. c. Controlling Risk. Frequent review points are provided when the project is divided into manageable tasks and activities. Depending upon the project, senior management may not authorize expansion of the project to the next phase without a review of project performance and cost estimates. Cost estimates for the next phase should be prepared. This provides management with some degree of assurance that they are authorizing work to be performed against an estimate that is reasonably reliable. This is done so that management may operate in a controlled risk environment. (1) Managing Risk on an Exception Basis. The role for senior management diminishes through the phases of the SDLC. This is appropriate and represents optimum use of senior management's limited time. In order to address the possibility of subsequent cost or scope changes, however, management may wish to qualify their approval. Thus, approval may be given to proceed as long as cost and benefits remain within specified boundaries and all requirements continue to be satisfied. In the event that a subsequent phase review finds that these conditions no longer exist, the previous approval is rescinded and permission to proceed further must be obtained through a senior management review and approval step.

17.

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES a. Sponsoring Organization. In general, system deployment projects are sponsored and "owned" by the division chief/division director overseeing the primary business function served by the system. The responsibilities of the sponsoring organization or System Owner include: (1) Initiating the project request for a new information system or modification to an existing system. (2) Maintaining active senior level involvement through the Enterprise Change Control Board (E-CCB) and/or steering committee throughout the development of the system. (3) Participating in project review activities and reviewing project deliverables.

(4) Selecting a System Owner representative(s) as the key participant(s) on the project team with responsibility for defining the functional/user needs. (5) Describing functional requirements to the project team and interfacing with others. (6) Ensuring that the final product meets user requirements. b. Office of Training and Professional Development. The Office of Training and Professional Development (TPD) has primary responsibility for training-related issues during the Systems Development Life Cycle. In order to ensure effective coordination with TPD when training issues arise, Project Managers must contact TPD as early as possible in the project life cycle. This ensures that specific training needs are assessed before any changes with a training component are implemented. c. OCIO Representative. (1) The OCIO Representative (also known as the OCIO Project Lead) has the responsibility for coordinating all management and technical aspects of the development effort. The OCIO Representative is responsible for oversight of the development of the Project Management Plan, completing the project within schedule and budget, meeting customer needs, and reporting to oversight boards as required. (2) Some of the OCIO Representative's responsibilities overlap with those of the Project Manager. It is important, therefore, that the OCIO Representative and Project Manager work closely with one another to coordinate their activities. Ultimately the OCIO Representative is responsible for caretaking TTB's interests in the project and guiding its overall direction while the Project Manager is responsible for directing the day-to-day activities of the development or integration team. (3) The OCIO Representative is also responsible for: (a) Working with the development or integration organization to determine the project team organization based on System Owner and information systems organization recommendations. (b) Developing measurement criterion that defines what constitutes acceptable performance of each task. (c) Scheduling and directing milestone reviews and participating in reviews conducted by independent staff or review committee. (d) Resolving problems related to all phases. (e) Overseeing preparation of required artifacts and maintaining a project file. (f) Facilitating communication between the customer and the rest of the project team.

Integrated Project Team (IPT). (1) The OCIO Representative is the leader of the project team. Project team members bring technical and/or functional expertise to the project and each member plans and performs tasks involving that individual's area of expertise. Team members may not necessarily serve on the project team for the duration of the project; however, all project team members must be identified in the planning phase of the project. (2) In addition to the OCIO Representative, the IPT may include the project manager, representative of the sponsoring organization, representative(s) of the users, configuration manager, requirements manager, system developer, test managers, maintenance organization representative, data manager, Infrastructure Operations representative, and ISSO representative. (3) Once the planning is completed, members whose contributions are scheduled for later in the project may not be active participants until shortly before their involvement. Members of the project team, who have been involved at the beginning of the project and have made their contribution, may return to other duties long before the project is completed. Other members may be involved in the project throughout its life cycle, although not on a full time basis. (4) The systems project transcends the boundaries of many organizational units. To derive maximum benefit from the life cycle methodology, certain key organizational concepts should be in place. These concepts provide a means for working within the structure of the life cycle. There are several components of organizations that are an

integral part to the life cycle and are discussed below. The OCIO Representative must consult with the managers of each organizational unit when identifying and appointing team members. Additionally, the OCIO Representative must clarify the team member's non-project workload responsibilities. This clarification is required both by the individual and the OCIO Representative and will affect the workload estimates rendered by the project team member during the planning process. Project team members (and number) will vary according to projects. A select number of team members and their responsibilities are described below. h. User. (1) User involvement is the most critical factor in achieving a high level of acceptance and satisfaction in the life cycle process.

ESTIMATING STAFF REQUIREMENTS Estimating project human resource requirements is a four-step process described below. a. Understand the Scope of the System. A comprehensive understanding of the scope of the system is required to estimate staff requirements more accurately. Such an understanding will minimize the likelihood of misconstruing the complexity of the system or forgetting tasks. In general, the estimator should be an individual close to the source of the work. This means that the individuals responsible for each task to be performed should develop their own estimates and provide these estimates to the Project Manager. In this way they will feel a greater sense of responsibility for holding close to their estimates during execution. b. Identify the Tasks. The tasks to be performed must be identified before attempting to estimate. Depending on the phase in the development process for which the estimate is being prepared, the estimator will identify tasks by extracting and refining larger units of work. A prerequisite to estimating is compiling a definitive list of tasks. Any precedent relationships among the tasks should be well understood before beginning. Tasking for a phase can be done during the preceding phase to better assure valid cost figures are used. Using automated project scheduling system (tools) will help determine the impact of a change to one task upon the entire project's resources. c. Estimate Time Required. Once the tasks for a phase have been identified and documented, estimate the amount of time for each task. The Project Manager can estimate the time required on a task-by-task basis, keeping in mind the quantity and experience levels of the staff assigned to a task. d. Review Estimates. Automated project scheduling systems will facilitate production of initial project staffing reports and allow a regular review of the initial staffing projections throughout the life cycle. As the project advances through the life cycle, this method of time estimate reviews is likely to result in increasingly accurate estimates. The Project Manager should schedule these reviews as tasks are produced.

CHAPTER B. PROJECT CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT
1. GENERAL a. Project concept development begins with the System Owner identifying a new investment opportunity or identifying the need to develop or enhance an existing information technology investment. The justification of a functional requirement or an opportunity precedes initiation of the SDLC phases. During the justification process the System Owner provides the first critical description of the information technology requirement or opportunity and secures the funding needed to examine the requirement or opportunity and potential solutions. The Bureau commonly refers to this effort as an information system initiative that supports the mission, function, goals and objectives of the organization. b. To begin the justification process, the System Owner typically prepares a Business Case document (Pre-select and Select Business Case Templates). There are two important points to be noted here: (1) There is a strong emphasis on defining the information management requirement or opportunity and linking it to specific Bureau missions and goals as required by Raines' Rules (8 policy directives issued by OMB Director Franklin Raines in an October 25, 1996 memorandum); and, (2) Analysis of the business case will determine if the solution will be a new system or a modification of an existing automated system. A modification to existing manual or automated systems may be the best approach to address the requirement or opportunity. c. All initiatives will enter the Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process. If the initiative is funded, the planning phase will commence and the effort will report earned value based on cost and schedule performance against the approved baseline. CPIC provides the framework within which TTB can formulate, justify, manage, and maintain a portfolio of IT investments. For a complete description of this process refer to the TTB Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) Program Guide available from the OCIO. 2. TASKS AND ACTIVITIES

Planning Phase Review Checklist. This checklist is to be used as a reference for the OCIO Representative to ensure that objectives of this phase are met. These issues are independent of the project size and effort. 6. REVIEW ACTIVITY The RFC submitter (usually the OCIO Representative or Project Manager) will present the proposed initiative to the E-CCB for their review. E-CCB approval is required for the project to move into the Planning Phase. For more information on the RFC process, see the Configuration Management Handbook. 7. DOCUMENTATION a. Business Case. The Business Case identifies and describes the information management requirement or opportunity and the results to be derived. Using the Business Case Template, the IT Portfolio Selection Template, the System Owner must clearly identify and describe the information management requirement or opportunity since it will be critical to the successful development of an appropriate solution. The Business Case Template is available on the TTB IT Governance intraweb site or from the TTB Enterprise Architect. b. Business Requirements Document. (1) The Business Requirements Document (BRD) captures the high level business requirements that the project is to meet. These requirements will drive the Statement of Work and will serve as the foundation for the Requirements Definition Phase. In the Requirements Definition Phase the business requirements will be converted into detailed system requirements. (2) Revisions to the Business Requirements Document may occur in the Planning Phase as updated information becomes available. Once the Requirements Definition Phase begins, however, any subsequent changes to the business requirements are captured in the Requirements Document (RD) and not the BRD. The Business Requirements Document should follow the outline in Chapter I.7.Exhibit 31 (Business Requirements Document Outline). c. AIS Categorization Worksheet. The AIS Categorization Worksheet serves as documentation for a system's justification for its respective Information Sensitivity and Mission Criticality classifications. As such, it facilitates the system categorization. However, it also provides the following for an individual system: 1) System Classification (describe if it is a General Support System, Major Application, or Minor Application and its parent Major Application), 2) General Profile (description, hardware/software components, mission/function supported, number of users, data sensitivity, mission criticality, etc.), 2) Technical Profile (operating environment, interfaces, data sources, code locations, etc.) 3) Security Profile (privacy, certification, e-authentication, etc.). The AIS Categorization Worksheet template is maintained by the ISSO.

d. Acquisition Plan. (1) The Acquisition Plan (AP) is a formal written document reflecting the specific actions necessary to execute the approach established in the approved acquisition strategy and guiding contractual deployment. Subpart 7.1 of the federal Acquisition Regulation (Chapter 1 of title 48, Code of federal Regulations) provides specific guidance on the AP. The AP shows how all hardware, software, telecommunications capabilities, and contractor support services are acquired during the life of the project. The AP helps to ensure that the needed resources can be obtained and are available at the time they are needed. The plan includes a schedule that lists the activities to be completed as well as deliverables to be produced with appropriate estimated dates of completion. (2) Acquisition Planning includes the following elements: (a) Provide management with adequate information for making decisions about the procurement of contractor services, including assurance of the availability of funding and compliance with the Section 508 EIT Accessibility Standards; (b) Provide technical evaluation personnel with adequate information for analyzing and evaluating vendor proposals; (c) Ensure that vendors will have adequate information for preparing bids; and (d) Provide the source selection official with adequate information on which to base a selection. (3) The AP typically has its own mini-life cycle of pre-solicitation; solicitation and award; and post-award. The life cycle model will vary according to the system development effort. This means that the activities in each area will differ significantly. The model AP includes the following activities by providing a schedule and estimated completion dates for each. (a) Statement of Work. (b) Procurement Plan. (c) Acquisition for Contractor Services. (d) Legal Opinion of Statement of Work. (e) Solicitation of Services. (f) Technical Evaluation Report. (g) Source Selection Recommendation. (h) Contract Award. (i) Adjustment of Funds.

(j) Contract Performance. (l) Several software, services, and/or hardware acquisitions will probably be needed to procure an entire system and will be a continuous part of the cycle. The acquisition plan is continuously updated and the involvement of users working closely with the project manager and the procurement manager becomes increasingly important. The project manager works directly with the procurement manager and the Bureau's procurement and contracting authorities to ensure the timely award of the needed resources. e. Statement of Work. (1) The Statement of Work (SOW) is a technical document that clearly and accurately describes the product or service that the contractor will develop, perform, or deliver. The OCIO Representative works with the Procurement Manager and the System Owner to develop the Statement of Work. (2) It is possible that multiple procurements will be conducted for a single life cycle effort. For example, one procurement may be conducted for the planning and requirements definition activities and another for the design and development of the system or multiple contractors may be procured to implement various products or services that contribute to the project as a whole. In these cases, multiple Statements of Work shall be produced, one for each procurement.

CHAPTER C. PLANNING PHASE
1. GENERAL a. The purpose of the Planning Phase is to establish a model of the recommended solution to provide a better definition of the requirement to be addressed. This phase provides the basis for acquiring resources needed to achieve the solution through the remaining SDLC phases. b. The results of this phase provide a framework which guides the work performed in the subsequent phase. That work will refine the understanding of requirements, solution and project management approach. The end of this phase is a critical juncture for the project in that program management makes a firm commitment to obtain the resources required throughout the life cycle and approves work to further define the detailed requirements of the recommended solution. c. During this phase the project team is established and other organizations become involved. This phase establishes involvement by customer organizations, as well as the initial involvement of individuals responsible for configuration management, data administration, quality control, change control management, system security, training and procurement support. Project decisions made in this phase include: (1) Project approach decisions include: (a) How will the effort be organized? (b) What is the life cycle strategy? (c) What methodologies and tools will be used in the requirements definition phase? (2) Project execution decisions include: (a) What is the overall architecture of the system/data? (b) To what extent will the system/data interface with existing system/data? (c) How will technical, programmatic, and other risks be addressed? (d) What are the high-level data requirements? (e) What are the high-level functional requirements? (f) What are the system security requirements? (g) What are the anticipated training requirements? (h) Who are the user organizations? (i) Can the requirement be addressed with current system/data resources?

(j) What are the performance objectives and measures? (k) Which parts of the Section 508 EIT Technical Standards for accessibility apply to the project? (3) Project continuation decisions include: (a) Are funding and resources available for the entire system life cycle? (b) Have the appropriate approvals been obtained for the system to continue? (c) Does the information requirement continue to exist? d. In this phase, the prerequisites are the feasibility study and the cost-benefit analysis. The requirement is typically identified in a feasibility study; however, the requirement may result from a legislative mandate, user problem report, user proposal, or an identified problem/opportunity.

2.

TAILORING THE SDLC STRUCTURE a. Altering the SDLC. For some information systems, it may be appropriate to alter the SDLC structure. For very simple systems (e.g., single-user applications) it may be appropriate to combine parts of activities. For projects using methodologies such as rapid prototyping, some activities may overlap. For very large or complex systems, it may be appropriate to divide the system into major subsystems and manage the evolution of each subsystem through its own life cycle. For these systems, it will be important to develop project team structures and other methods to ensure effective coordination across subsystems. b. Considerations for Tailoring the SDLC. Three considerations described below are important when tailoring the life cycle to suit a particular situation. (1) The tailoring of the life cycle methodology is to be clearly documented in the SDLC Waiver Request Form (Exhibit 1 SDLC Waiver Request Form) and the Project Management Plan (Exhibit 4 Project Management Plan Outline) delivered by the Project Manager for the system. (2) All decisions regarding project approach, execution and continuation are to be explicitly documented (i.e., not made by default or accident). Decisions should be made and recorded no later than the completion of the corresponding activity in the life cycle. (3) Plans for system reviews and approvals are to be specifically included regardless of any tailoring of the life cycle. This will ensure appropriate program management participation and oversight. As appropriate, reviews and approvals designated in this guidance may be consolidated to reflect the consolidation of individuals' activities. c. Tailoring Information Systems Projects.

Systems Development Life Cycle Handbook

(1) General. Although any systems project may require altering, information systems projects listed and described below will always require tailoring. Organizations may find it necessary to add other types of systems projects to this list, or provide more specific guidance, depending on the systems' functions and requirements. (2) Tailoring the SDLC Model. The SDLC model describes a full range of tasks and products that may be required for system development. All tasks and products may not be appropriate or cost-effective for every project. The model must be tailored to address the specific requirements of individual development projects. Large, complex projects will require a broader range of activities and products than smaller or less complex systems. (3) Systems Maintenance. The SDLC model describes a maintenance phase during which requested changes to existing systems are requested through the Enterprise Configuration Control Board and are implemented as required. For significant systems modifications, the activities required to implement changes effectively mirror those of the entire system life cycle. Products under configuration control must be updated to reflect changes. For significant system modifications, guidelines provided in the planning through maintenance/ operations phase should be followed. The types of activities categorized as systems maintenance may include the following: (a) Conversion/Upgrade. The modification of a system to reflect changes in the operating environment of both hardware and software. (b) Corrective. The removal of one or more defects from the system. (c) Adaptive. Minor changes to data, function or content to reflect changes in the business environment and/or legislation. (d) Perfective. The alteration, rewriting or restructuring of a system to reduce the maintenance effort or result in more efficient operations. This may include the implementation of new functionality. The Maintenance Lifecycle is described in Appendix H. (4) Emergency Maintenance. In the event that a system in operational status is suddenly unable to execute in an acceptable manner, maintenance must be performed at once. Effort expended in this regard is classified as "emergency maintenance." Typically such projects are approached in a "do now, report later" mode. System Owners are responsible for insuring that all necessary documentation/approvals are completed once the system is again operational. (5) Development or Systems Maintenance Work Performed under Contract. When performing systems development or maintenance efforts under contract it is necessary to ensure that adequate documentation is required as deliverables as set forth in this Order. Documentation must be provided in alternate formats at no charge, if requested by users with disabilities. Documentation needed to provide an audit track of decisions must also be required as deliverables.

d. Prototype Projects. A mini-cycle called the prototyping life cycle could be embedded within the requirements definition phase. The mini-cycle is an alternative approach to the generation and validation of written requirement specifications as a means of ensuring that a software product will be responsive to user needs. The four stages of the mini-cycle are described in Appendix F (Small-Scale Development Efforts).

Planning Phase Review Checklist). This checklist is to be used as a reference for the OCIO Representative to ensure that objectives of this phase are met. These issues are independent of the project size and effort. The checklist is also for use in conducting the Initial Planning Review. 7. REVIEW ACTIVITY a. The Initial Planning Review is performed at the end of this phase. The review ensures the goals and objectives of the system are identified and the feasibility of the system is established. The Project Management Plan is evaluated for completeness, validity, and approach. Other products of the Planning Phase are reviewed. b. The review is conducted by a review organization that is included in the Project Management Plan. Participants in the review include the Project Manager and project user(s) and may include additional project team members. Depending on the size and complexity of the project, the review may be conducted by an oversight board at the request of the E-CCB. 8. DOCUMENTATION a. Project Management Plan. (1) The Project Management Plan is prepared for all projects. It incorporates key planning documents, using a building block approach to planning. It is a vehicle for documenting project scope, tasks, schedule, earned value, allocating resources, and interrelationships with other projects. It also provides details on the involved functional units, required job tasks, and milestone and review scheduling. (2) Revisions to the Project Management Plan may occur in future phases as updated information becomes available, particularly with regards to the project schedule. Software designed for Gantt charts and project descriptions are available to complete the Project Management Plan. The Project Management Plan should follow the outline in Exhibit 4 (Project Management Plan Outline).

(3) A project plan schedule outline exists in the Process Asset Library (PAL). The outline provides all the necessary deliverables, reviews, meetings, and decisions required by the SDLC. This document is required to be delivered when providing updates on the Request for Change (RFC) to the Enterprise Change Control Board. (4) Earned Value Management (EVM) is a project management tool that measures a Contractor's actual cost, schedule and performance against the planned cost, schedule and performance to determine if any deviations from the planned milestones exist, the extent of those deviations, and the impact of those deviations to the remainder of the project. b. Configuration Management Plan. (1) The purpose of the Configuration Management (CM) Plan is to establish uniform CM practices to manage the establishment of and changes to the system hardware and software for TTB's Major Applications (MA). The plan identifies the physical location of system baselines; the locations in which hard copy documentation is stored; and the automated libraries used to store other documentation and the software components of the system. CM helps maintain the integrity of the system throughout its life cycle and facilitates communication about the system among project team members, users, and other supporting organizations. (2) CM guidelines are applied through the systematic identification, control, and audit of system characteristics. CM includes the following: (a) Configuration identification of functional and physical characteristics of a system through structured documentation baselines; (b) Configuration control of changes to the physical and functional characteristics of hardware and software systems and baseline documentation describing them; (c) Configuration status accounting about the current configuration and changes to it; (d) Configuration audits to verify that system performance and configuration are accurately identified in the baseline documentation; and, (e) Storage and control of access to the baseline documentation, source code, and executable code. (3) A baseline is a documented technical description that becomes a reference point against which changes can be proposed, evaluated, and incorporated. The existing applicable MA CM Plan should be updated during the Planning Phase to reflect any exceptions to the existing uniform CM practices for the Major Application. In the event that the project comprises a new TTB Major Application, a new CM Plan will be drafted in this phase. The CM Plan will be updated in the Deployment Phase once all system baselines have been finalized. Follow the outline in Exhibit 5 (Configuration Management Plan Outline) to complete the Configuration Management Plan. c. Risk Assessment.

(1) Risk assessments are required and are essential to ensure that management controls are in place to provide reasonable assurance that Government resources are protected against fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or misappropriation. (2) The existing applicable MA Risk Assessment should be updated during the Planning Phase. In the event that the project comprises a new TTB Major Application, a new Risk Assessment will be drafted in this phase. The Risk Assessment will be updated throughout the lifecycle as information changes or becomes available. (3) The TTB Risk Assessment Template describes the procedures to conduct a risk assessment of information systems and to prepare a risk assessment plan. This template can be found on the TTB PAL. (4) Risk assessment is synonymous with risk analysis. The Risk Assessment Plan ensures that each project, on an ongoing basis, identifies any significant risks that, if realized, would result in project delays, cost overruns, increases in scope, or overall failure. The plan should document strategies for mitigating any such risks, and define an ongoing process to identify and address new risks as they surface. The Risk Assessment Plan should also provide alternative action plans to be used when realized risks result in negative consequences for the project. Examples of risks include Personnel Shortfalls, Schedule slippages, Unanticipated Budgets reductions, Developing the Wrong Software Functions, Developing the Wrong User Interface, Continuing Stream of Requirement Changes, etc. (5) The Risk Assessment Plan should include the following process: (a) Identify the project's top risks; (b) Identify strategies for mitigating potential risks; (c) Update project risks, mitigation strategies and results on an ongoing basis; (d) Highlight risk management in monthly project reviews; (e) Initiate appropriate corrective actions. (6) The Risk Assessment should be started during the Planning Phase and will continue to be updated throughout the lifecycle. During the Planning Phase the Risk Assessment should focus on high level threats and the type of data that is expected to be handled. Understanding risks at this stage will enable them to be addressed during requirements definition and design. As the project continues through the lifecycle the high level threats will either be mitigated or be refined into specific, detailed system vulnerabilities.

(1) The existing applicable MA System Security Plan should be updated during the Planning Phase. In the event that the project comprises a new TTB Major Application, a new System Security Plan will be drafted in this phase. The System Security Plan will be updated throughout the lifecycle as information changes or becomes available. (2) The Security Plan is the initial document addressing overall security requirements. The Security Plan is updated through the testing phase and the supporting documentation such as risk assessment, contingency planning, re-certification, etc., is covered in the proceeding phases. The System Owner completes and signs the Security Plan. (3) The Major Application Security Plan template is available on the TTB Intranet or by request from the ISSO. (4) The Bureau is required to protect AIS resources from potential security threats by identifying safeguards through the use of vulnerability and risk assessments. The safeguards become the security requirements and considerations that are associated with the development and deployment of new or enhanced software, hardware, equipment, policy or other FIP technology or products. The development of security safeguards is an integral part of the systems development methodology and is inherent in each phase of the life cycle. (5) If work is to be performed offsite, Operational Security Plans for the vendor's building and offices are also required. Vendors must contact the Information Systems Security Officer for specific guidance on the preparation of Operational Security Plans. Additional information security requirements may also be required. (6) Life cycle security refers to steps taken to ensure that a system is planned, designed, developed, and maintained according to requirements using formalized and rigorous security policies, controls, and standards. However, inadequacies in the planning and development of computer systems/applications are a frequent source of harmful effects, and in most cases, the effort to improve security is concentrated on the application system. (7) System developers often think to improve functionality first, and delay security issues later. However, many opportunities to include effective controls are lost if security is not considered early. Security decisions must be an integral part of the planning, development, and operation of a computer system/application. Systems must be carefully evaluated and tested during each life cycle phase and re-evaluated whenever changes are made that could affect the protection mechanisms. In this way, confidence can be provided that the systems development interpretation of security policies is maintained accurately and without distortion. (8) The SDLC specifies a sequence of reviews, evaluations, walkthroughs and operational tests that guarantee that the requirement definition, design, development, deployment, and operations/maintenance of a system are accomplished under rigorous controls and standards. The sequential nature of the life cycle provides an iterative process in which the security considerations in a previous phase frequently drive the security considerations in the next phase.

CHAPTER D. REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION PHASE
1. GENERAL a. The purpose of the Requirements Definition Phase is twofold. First, project requirements are developed and defined in terms of how they will advance the TTB Strategic Plan. Second, user needs are analyzed in order to develop user requirements. User requirements are defined in a Requirements Document (RD) at a level of detail sufficient to permit system design to proceed. This phase expands the high level business requirements into specific detailed functional and data requirements. These requirements provide the basis for a more concrete assessment of system benefits and costs, and form the basis for the detailed system design. b. During the Requirements Definition Phase, the system is defined in more detail, i.e., system inputs, processes, and outputs. This process takes place at the functional level, in that the system is described in terms of the functions to be performed, not in terms of computer programs, files and data streams. The emphasis in this phase is on determining what functions must be performed, not how to perform those functions. The requirements definition methodology and tools to be employed were determined during the Planning Phase. c. The System Owner works with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) personnel in determining and documenting system requirements and features to these Acts. d. The Requirements Definition Phase is initiated when a project is approved for development in the Initial Planning Review or by management direction. The Business Requirements Document from the Concept Development Phase is used as the basis for further analysis of user needs and the development of detailed user requirements. The analysis may surface new insights into the overall information systems requirements, and in such instances, all deliverables should be revised to reflect this analysis. A number of project decisions are made in this phase. (1) Project approach decisions include: (a) What specific methodologies will be used in the design phase? (b) What specific tools will be used in the design phase? This tool/method portfolio includes CASE tools and prototyping methods, and the linkage of these methods and tools across all future life cycle phases and activities. (2) Project execution decisions include: (a) What are the user workflow processes? (b) What are the detailed functional requirements and their priorities? (c) What are the detailed data requirements and their priorities?

(d) What potential requirements will not be included in the new system? (e) What modifications need to be made to previous deliverables? (f) Which parts of the Section 508 EIT Technical Standards for accessibility apply to the project? (g) Are there FOIA/PA concerns for this effort? (3) Project continuation decisions include: (a) Does the information system requirement continue to exist? (b) Do the detailed requirements address the requirement sufficiently to permit continuation to the design phase? (c) Are sufficient funding and other required resources available for the remainder of the system life cycle? 2. TASKS AND ACTIVITIES The following tasks and activities are conducted during this phase. These activities may be expanded depending on the size of the proposed system. a. Survey/document the user operation b. Document the user process workflow c. Conduct detailed analysis d. Define the quality assurance/internal control mechanisms e. Develop prototype f. Identify and document the accessibility requirements g. Identify and document detailed functional requirements h. Identify and document detailed data requirements i. Define security requirements j.

to begin before all Requirements Definition Phase activities are concluded. Contingencies for such scenarios should be defined and attached to the EPAF. 5. ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION During the Requirements Definition Phase there are specific issues that should be addressed. These issues are included in Exhibit 7 (Requirements Phase Review Checklist). The project team uses the Requirements Definition Issues Checklist to ensure objectives of this phase are met. These issues are independent of the project size and scope. The checklist is also used for conducting the Requirements Review. 6. REVIEW ACTIVITY a. The Requirements Review is performed at the end of this phase. This review ensures that requirements are complete, verifiable, concise, consistent, unambiguous and attainable. Requirements are traced back to the business requirements defined in the Concept Development Phase. Architectural requirements are verified for alignment with the Enterprise Architecture, and security requirements are verified for alignment with the Baseline Security Requirements. Project documents are validated for conformance to quality factors as described in the QA Plan, and revised if necessary. The Requirements Review checklist is provided at Exhibit 7 (Requirements Phase Review Checklist) to ensure that review goals are met. b. Participants in the Requirements Review include the OCIO Representative, Project Manager, System Owner and/or user. Other project team members may participate in the review. Depending on the size and complexity of the project, the review may be conducted by an oversight board appointed by the E-CCB. 7. DOCUMENTATION a. Requirements Document. (1) The Requirements Document serves as the foundation for system design and development. It captures all user requirements to be implemented in a new or enhanced system to satisfy business needs. It may also contain descriptions of the existing and proposed methods and procedures, performance requirements, inputs and outputs, and other known requirements. (2) Requirements are traced back to the business requirements defined in the Concept Development Phase. If required for analysis, a general description of the business policies and functions to be supported by the system is provided. This description may be independent of the way that the functions are currently carried out. If the intent is to automate existing functional processes exactly, then the existing processes should be described. Some areas of the outline may not be applicable to the system under development and can be excluded or marked "Not Applicable." Follow the outline in Exhibit 8 (Requirements Document Outline) to complete the Requirements Document.

(3) The TTB Baseline Security Requirements will be evaluated and included and supplemented in the Requirements Document where appropriate. The TTB Baseline Minimum Security Requirements are maintained by the ISSO. The information system categorization will determine which set of baseline minimum security requirements is applicable. (4) With the approval of the P-CCB, the Requirements Document may be updated in the Design and/or Development Phases. Requirements Document updates should be limited to changes that do not markedly expand or contract the scope of the project. Changes in scope must be submitted to the E-CCB for approval. See the CM Handbook for more information on the P-CCB process. b. Quality Assurance Plan. The purpose of the Quality Assurance Plan is to indicate the means by which the quality assurance (QA) requirements established for a system development effort will be met. The degree of QA applied and the level of detail contained in this plan should be appropriately tailored to and consistent with the complexity, size, intended use, mission-criticality, and cost of failure of the system development effort. An outline for the QA plan is provided at Exhibit 9 (Quality Assurance Plan Outline). c. Privacy Impact Assessment. The PIA relates specifically to a system's handling of information in identifiable form (IIF), such as names and Social Security Numbers. The Privacy Impact Assessment template is maintained by the ISSO. The PIA has the following functions: (1) To ensure handling of IIF conforms to applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements regarding privacy (2) To determine the risks and effects of collecting, maintaining, and disseminating IIF in an electronic information system (3) To examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes for handling IIF to mitigate potential privacy risks d. Privacy Act System of Records Notice. The OCIO Representative establishes initial contact with the Bureau's FOIA/PA representative in this phase. The OCIO Representative and FOIA/PA representative work together in the succeeding phases to determine and document system features and requirements pertinent to these Acts. This collaboration is necessary due to the long lead-time necessary for inclusion of the Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register and for the comment period. The notice should be announced in the Federal Register in the design phase. In addition, the FOIA/PA representative works with the project manager and appropriate organizations to prepare a notice to announce the disposal or deletion of a Privacy Act System of Records, if applicable.

CHAPTER E. DESIGN PHASE
1. GENERAL a. The purpose of the Design Phase is to transform the requirements defined in the previous phase into a complete, detailed specification for the system. The analyses of this phase are performed within the framework of the system initiative, converting the functional and data requirements into a complete system design that will guide the work of the development phase. The decisions made in this phase address in detail how the system will meet the previously defined functional and data requirements. The Design Phase activities may be conducted in a two-phase approach. The first phase produces an external (general) design that emphasizes the functional features of the system. The second phase produces an internal (detailed) design that expands the general design by providing all the technical detail. The design methodology and tools to be employed were determined during the Requirements Definition Phase. b. In the external design of the system, the external characteristics of the system are defined. The operating system is established and the automated system is packaged into major design subsystems. The inputs and outputs of each subsystem are defined, the interfaces to external systems are designed, and the administrative activities are established. Security and auditing needs are addressed. c. In the internal design of the system, the detailed structure of the system from the subsystems identified in the external design is created. Each subsystem is partitioned into one or more design units or modules. For each design unit or module, the process is described in a structure chart, flowchart, pseudo-code, or some other acceptable format. Detailed logic specifications are then written for each module described and data usage is physically defined to the elemental level. Everything requiring user input and approval is completed in this activity. d. The decisions of this phase reexamine in greater detail many of the parameters of the system concept addressed in the previous phases. The decisions made in this phase also address how the system will meet the previously defined functional and data requirements. The system design prepared in this phase will be the basis for the activities of the development phase. The overall objective is to establish a complete design for the system. The prerequisites for this phase are the Project Management Plan and the Requirements Document. A number of decisions are made in this phase. (1) Project approach decisions include: (a) What specific methodologies and tools will be used in the development and deployment phases? (b) How will user support be provided? (c) How will development and deployment be phased? (d) How are newly identified risks and issues to be handled?

(2) Project execution decisions include: (a) What modifications must be made to the initial information system requirement? (b) What modifications will be made to current procedures? (c) What modifications will be made to current systems/databases or to other systems/ databases under development? How will conversion of existing data take place? (3) Project continuation decisions include: (a) Does the information system requirement continue to exist? (b) Does the system design address the requirement sufficiently to continue the development activities? (c) Is each requirement traceable to a design component? Is each design component traceable to a requirement? (d) Are sufficient funding and other resources available for the remainder of the life cycle? 2. TASKS AND ACTIVITIES The following activities are performed in this phase. These activities may be expanded or deleted depending on the size of the proposed system. a. Design and document system interfaces b. Document communications requirements c. Design and document inputs, input processing d. Design and document security controls e.

ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION During the Design Phase a number of specific external and internal design issues are addressed. These issues are provided in the checklist at Exhibit 10 (Design Phase Checklist). The checklist is used as a reference for the project manager and system developer to ensure objectives of this phase are met. These issues are independent of the project size and effort.

6.

REVIEW ACTIVITY Three reviews are conducted during the Design Phase. a. The Preliminary Design Review is an ongoing review of the system design process as it evolves through the Design Phase. The Preliminary Design Review will review the architecture of the system, including the logical, physical, security, data, user, and process view of the system. The design of the system will be traced back to the functional and business requirements defined in previous phases. A review of the graphical user interface shall be conducted as part of this review or in conjunction with this review. A Logical Data Model (LDM) Review shall be conducted by the Data Management (DM) team in conjunction with the Preliminary Design Review. It must follow all naming conventions and use the TTB standard database design tool. b. The Final Design Review confirms that modifications prompted by earlier reviews are incorporated. The checklist at Exhibit 10 (Design Phase Checklist) is provided to ensure review goals are met. Participants in the preliminary design and final design reviews include the OCIO Representative, Project Manager, project user, and the system developer. Other project team members may be requested to participate in the reviews. Depending on the size and complexity of the project, the reviews may be conducted by a review committee. An updated LDM Review is also conducted and followed at some point during the Final Design Review by a Physical Data Model (PDM) Review. A Data Conversion/Migration Plan Review can be at the same time as the Physical Data Model Review or at a later time, as long as it is prior to deployment. Each process requires a two-week lead-time to review documents.

7.

DOCUMENTATION a. Design Document. (1) The Design Document describes the external and internal design of the information system solution. (2) The external design consists of requirements, business rules, operating environment and design characteristics for an information system. The external design is used in conjunction with the RD to provide a complete system specification of all user requirements for the system. (3) The internal design describes the detailed system and subsystem designs that will be used in developing the information system. It contains the database design, file structures, input formats, output layouts, and module processing logic

to be used during system development (4) The Design Document includes all information required for the review and approval of the project development during the design as outlined in Exhibit 11 (Design Document Outline). The paragraphs and subparagraphs of the Design Document may be organized, rearranged, or repeated as necessary to reflect the best organization for a particular project. (5) With the approval of the P-CCB, the Design Document may be updated in the Development Phases. Design Document updates should be limited to changes that do not markedly expand or contract the scope of the project. Changes in scope must be submitted to the E-CCB for approval. b. Conversion Plan. The Conversion Plan describes the strategies involved for converting data from an existing system to another hardware or software environment. It is appropriate to re-examine the original system's functional requirements for the condition of the system prior to conversion in order to determine if the original requirements are still valid. A description of the Conversion Plan is included in Exhibit 13 (Conversion Plan Outline). c. Contingency Plan. (1) Each system component must develop and test contingency plans that will enable them to continue to operate during and after a catastrophic event that significantly interrupts their normal processing. Each contingency plan must be tested at a frequency commensurate with the risk and magnitude of loss or harm that could result from the disruption of a systems operation. (2) A Contingency Plan must be developed for each mission critical system, that is, those systems that significantly affect Bureau programs, property, finances and other resources. Contingency plans should be prepared systematically to cover as many disruptions as possible. (3) The existing applicable MA Contingency Plan should be updated during the Design Phase. In the event that the project comprises a new TTB Major Application, a new Contingency Plan will be drafted in this phase. The Contingency Plan will be updated throughout the lifecycle as information changes or becomes available. (4) A Contingency Plan Template/Outline is located in the PAL. g. Test Plan. (1) The purpose of the Test Plan is to ensure that all aspects of the system are adequately tested and that the system can be successfully implemented. The test outline documents the scope, content, methodology, sequence, management of and responsibilities for test activities. The Test Plan describes the test activities of: unit/module test, subsystem integration test, system qualification test, and system acceptance test in progressively higher levels of detail as the system is developed. Security testing activities are documented in the Security Test Plan.

(2) The Test Plan provides guidance for the management of test activities, including organization, relationships, and responsibilities. The test case procedures may be included in the Test Plan or in a separate document, depending on system size. The project user assists in developing the Test Plan that describes the nature and extent of tests deemed necessary. This provides a basis for verification of unit tests and validation of the system. The validation process ensures that the system conforms to the functional requirements in the RD and that other applications or subsystems are not adversely impacted. Test analysis reports are developed at each level of testing to record the results of testing and certify readiness for system deployment (see Test Phase). (3) Problems, deficiencies, modifications, and refinements identified during testing or deployment should be tracked under configuration control and tested using the same test procedures as those described in the Test Plan. Specific tests may need to be added to the plan at that time, and other documentation may need updating upon deployment, as well. Notification of implemented changes to the initiator of the change request/ problem report and to the users of the system is also handled as part of the configuration control process. A modified system acceptance test, including the users of the system, should be performed before changes are implemented. (4) The Test Plan Outline at Exhibit 17 (Test Plan Outline) is a dynamic document used for directing general testing throughout the life cycle. Use this outline for each test plan that is created, i.e. End-to-End Test Plan, IV&V Test Plan, and Security Test Plan. Test planning should begin in the Design Phase and should be updated with greater detail in the Development and Test Phases.

CHAPTER F. DEVELOPMENT PHASE
1. GENERAL a. The purpose of the Development Phase is to convert the deliverables of the Design Phase into a complete information system. Although much of the activity in the Development Phase addresses the computer programs that make up the system, this phase also puts in place the hardware, software and communications environment for the system, and other important elements of the overall system. The activities of this phase translate the system design produced in the Design Phase into a working information system capable of addressing the information system requirements. The development methodology and tools to be employed were determined during the Requirements Definition Phase. The elements of the system are developed (or acquired), tested, and integrated; hardware, system software, communications, applications, procedures, and associated documentation. At the end of this phase, the system is ready for the activities of the Test Phase. b. In this phase, the prerequisites are the: (1) Project Management Plan and schedule indicating target date for completion of each module and target date for completion of system testing; (2) Design document containing program logic flow, identification of any existing code to be used, subsystems, and the inputs and outputs of each subsystem; (3) Unit/module and integration test plans containing testing requirement schedule and test case specifications for unit and integration testing; and, (4) A controlled development environment is in place that is compatible with TTB's environment for software development and deployment. c. A number of decisions are made in this phase. (1) Project approach decisions include determining what individuals will participate in the acceptance testing. Be ready to select specific individuals from the sponsoring program organizations to represent their organizations during acceptance testing. This includes confirmation of testing procedures and logistics. (2) Project execution decisions include: (a) How should new requirements be handled? (b) What modifications must be made to the system design? (c) Have security and backup issues been identified and resolved? (d) Have all uncertainties been adequately addressed? (e) Have the accessibility requirements been adequately addressed?

DOCUMENTATION a. Deployment Plan. The Deployment Plan describes how the information system is to be installed and transitioned into an operational system. The plan contains an overview of the system, a brief description of the major tasks involved in the deployment, the overall resources needed to support the deployment effort (such as hardware, software, facilities, materials and personnel), and any site specific deployment requirements. The plan is developed during the Development Phase, is updated and finalized in the Test Phase, and is used for guidance during the Deployment Phase. The Deployment Plan is outlined in Exhibit 14 (Deployment Plan Outline). b. Source Code, Object Code, Load Module, and Source Data members. The methodology and format for generating source code is dependent on the language and available development tools. Guidelines for documentation will be coordinated within the project team. Source language data definition members are translated identifying and describing all data elements and their relationships that make up the database structure. c. Developer Certification Statement. The Developer Certification Statement serves as the Contractor's declaration that the developed system has been SIT tested and is ready to be tested by TTB. Any known defects are documented. A Developer Certification Statement template is available in Chapter I.7.Exhibit 30 (Developer Certification Statement template). d. User Manual. The User Manual contains all information that is essential for the user to make full use of the information system. This manual includes a description of the system functions and capabilities, contingencies and alternate modes of operation, and step-by-step procedures for system access and use. Graphics are used where possible in this manual. The manual format may be altered if another format is more suitable for the particular project. A sample outline is shown at Exhibit 18 (User Manual Outline).

CHAPTER G. TEST PHASE
1. GENERAL a. The primary purpose of the Test Phase is to prove that the developed system satisfies the requirements defined in the RD. The secondary purpose is to perform an integrated system function as specified by the design parameters. This function will be the responsibility of the quality assurance staff and will be heavily supported by the user participants. b. The prerequisites are the Requirements Document, Project Management Plan and schedule, system baseline software and documents, and a Test Plan containing all test requirements and schedules. 2. TASKS AND ACTIVITIES The following activities are performed during this phase. These activities may be expanded or deleted depending on the size of the proposed system. a. Perform End-to-End Testing (may include subsystem integration, system and/or performance testing) b. Perform IV&V Testing c. Prepare Independent Test Analysis Report to document the results of each formal test d. Perform User Acceptance Testing e. Assess security controls and complete security self-assessment f. Perform security testing

g. Manage defects (track, defer or correct, retest) h. Perform rework and retest i. Initiate user training

After the completion of each testing activity, ETE, IV&V, UAT and Security, the System Owner in conjunction with members of the IPT will review the reported defects and determine which will require rework and re-testing and which will be deferred. Defects requiring rework will result in small-scale reprisal of development activities as appropriate. In some cases minor requirements and/or design changes will need to be made as well. Corrected defects must be retested. Retesting shall consist of all stages of testing activities; i.e., unit test, ETE, IV&V, UAT, and Security. Retesting shall consist of targeted testing of the corrected defects with other regression testing scaled dependant on the level of integration of the defective component with other system functionality. Project schedules should

used as a reference for the Project Manager to ensure objectives of this phase are met. These issues are independent of the project size and effort. 6. REVIEW ACTIVITY The Test Analysis Review is performed during the Test Phase. Deficiencies are recorded in the report. The items to review are included in Exhibit 19 (Test Phase Review Checklist). A number of project team members participate in the test analysis review, at a minimum, the Project Manager and System Owner. The checklist indicates the other project team members who may be requested to participate in the review. Depending on the size and complexity of the project, the review may be conducted by a review committee. 7. DOCUMENTATION a. Maintenance Manual (1) The Maintenance Manual provides maintenance personnel with the information necessary to maintain the system effectively. The manual provides the definition of the software support environment, the roles and responsibilities of maintenance personnel, and the regular activities essential to the support and maintenance of program modules, job streams, and database structures. (2) In addition to the items identified for inclusion in the Maintenance Manual, any additional information may be provided to facilitate the maintenance and modification of the system. Appendices to document various maintenance procedures, standards, or other essential information may be added to this document as needed. The Maintenance Manual is outlined in Exhibit 12 (Maintenance Manual Outline). b. The Test Analysis Report documents each type of software testing: unit/module, subsystem integration, system qualification, system acceptance, and security, as defined in the test plan. The report records the results of the tests, presents the capabilities and deficiencies for review, and provides a means of assessing whether the software can progress to the next stage of development or testing. Reports are created as required in the remaining phases. The set of test analysis reports provides a basis for assigning responsibility for deficiency correction and follow-up, and for preparation of a statement of project completion. The report format is outlined at Exhibit 20 (Test Analysis Report Outline). c. Test problem report forms are generated as required and attached to the test analysis reports during testing at the integration level and higher. The disposition of problems found, starting with End-to-End Testing, will be tracked and reported under configuration control. d. Security Self-Assessment. The security self-assessment will analyze the controls in place for the system and provide a measure of the system's IT security assurance level. The system owner is responsible for conducting the self-assessment by leveraging the resources of the project team. Like the other security-related templates, the questionnaire for the self-assessment is available in the TTB PAL. The results of the

assessment are obtained in a form that can be readily used to determine which of the five levels specified in the federal IT Security Assessment Framework for which TTB has achieved with respect to the system. This will help TTB to prioritize efforts and evaluate progress as it works to ensure it maintains a robust IT security program. Thus, the selfassessment can be used for the following purposes: (1) To quickly gain an understanding of needed security improvements for a system (2) To provide a thorough evaluation of a system's security to: (a) fulfill reporting requirements; (b) prepare for audits; and (c) identify resources. (3) To assist TTB budget requests as outlined in OMB A-11 e. Revised Risk Assessment and System Security Plan. The Risk Assessment is updated to include risks identified during the Security Test & Evaluation process. The System Security Plan is updated to document any additional or updated security controls that are determined to be required.

CHAPTER H. DEPLOYMENT PHASE
1. GENERAL a. The Deployment Phase builds on the results of all prior phases. The Deployment Phase includes efforts required to prepare for deployment of the new system, deployment of the system in a production environment, and resolution of any problems identified during the deployment process. During the Deployment Phase, the system or system modifications are installed and made operational in a production environment; user training is conducted; data conversion is completed; and the system is turned over to the System Owner. A successful system deployment is critical to the operation phase. b. The Deployment Phase implements the components of the system developed and/or acquired during the development phase. This phase also uses approaches for data conversion, and training. Any deficiencies in implementing the system will handicap the initial use of the system. Therefore, it is important that deficiencies are addressed prior to fully implementing the system in a production environment because it will be more costly to resolve deficiencies once the system is turned over to the user. Modifications to the system should be completely documented in order to provide accurate documentation to users, operators, and other affected personnel. At the end of this phase, the production baseline is established and it consists of the production system, database(s) and data dictionary. A number of project approach decisions are made in this phase. These project approach decisions include: (1) What specific post-deployment methodologies and tools will be used? (2) Which changes or enhancements should be made now? (3) Does the information system requirement continue to exist? (4) Does the implemented system address the requirement sufficiently to be put in operation? (5) Are sufficient funding and other resources available for the remainder of the life cycle? (6) Was the system security certified and accredited? c. The prerequisites are the SDLC baseline documentation and baseline software.

2.

TASKS AND ACTIVITIES The following activities are performed during this phase. These activities may be expanded or deleted depending upon the requirements of the proposed system. a. Conduct production readiness review b. Schedule and coordinate deployment activities

ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION During the Deployment Phase there are specific issues that should be addressed. These issues are included in a checklist at Exhibit 21 (Production Readiness Review Checklist). The checklist is used as a reference for the Project Manager to ensure objectives of this phase are met. These issues are independent of the project size and effort.

6.

REVIEW ACTIVITY The Revalidation Review is performed during the Deployment Phase. The Deployment Issues Checklist may also be used in conducting the Revalidation Review. At the end of this phase, a revalidation report may be prepared to characterize the user acceptance of the system. This report may make recommendations for system modifications to correct errors in deployment, improve user satisfaction or improve system performance. For contractor development, analysis must be performed to determine if additional activity is within the scope of the original contract. User acceptance testing typically takes one of the following four forms: a. Parallel Operation. The old and new systems are operated in parallel until the new system successfully performs all user requirements. b. Staged Conversion. The system is installed in parts, e.g., by organizational unit or by system function. c. Pilot Operation. An immediate conversion is made to the new system; the old system is maintained as backup. Where multiple sites exist, one or two are usually selected for the pilot operation while the others continue to use the old system until the new system has been proven. d. Immediate Conversion. The old system is completely discontinued following installation of the new system.

7.

DOCUMENTATION a. Security Certification Statement. A security certification refers to the technical evaluation of a system or an application to verify that the installed security safeguards are adequate and work effectively for the system or application. To verify that the installed security safeguards are adequate and work effectively requires that these safeguards be tested. Certification takes place after system tests have been completed and the results of the tests indicate that the system or application meets all applicable federal and Justice policies, regulations, and standards. The security manager signs the security certification statement. b. Security Accreditation Statement. Accreditation refers to the confirmation by a responsible official that a system that is processing sensitive information has an acceptable level of risk and the information being processed is adequately protected. The completion of a risk assessment and certification of the system is consequently performed as part of the accreditation of the system. Accreditation can also be referred to as the certification of an application. The security manager signs the

CHAPTER I. OPERATIONS, MAINTENANCE & DISPOSITION PHASE
1. GENERAL a. In this phase the system is fully operational. Some systems are operated completely by users, particularly systems that operate on microcomputers. It is essential that users are fully aware of and carry out their responsibilities for all facets of operations, especially performing system backups. Providing user support is usually an ongoing activity. New users will require training to effectively use the system, and other users may require assistance as well. Emphasis of this phase is to ensure the user needs have been met and the system continues to perform as specified in the operational environment. This phase continues until the system is retired from use, which is the end of the system life cycle. b. Monitoring activities of the system will include both operational monitoring and security monitoring. Operational monitoring may include the review of error logs, memory and storage usage, availability and response times. Security monitoring may include intrusion detection, audit analysis, and periodic vulnerability assessment. c. Maintenance activities for the system occur to ensure that any previously undetected errors are fixed. Maintenance activities take advantage of hardware upgrades or new releases of system software and application software packages used to operate the system (e.g., upgrades and releases). Identifying potential modifications needed to ensure that the system continues to operate as intended and produces quality data. Determine whether modifications to the system and database(s) are needed to resolve errors or performance problems, or to provide new capabilities. New capabilities may take the form of routine maintenance, or may constitute enhancements to the system or database(s) that respond to user request for new/improved capabilities. Maintenance activities should be reevaluated and updated based on current need, planned enhancements or system replacement plans. Appropriate changes should be made to the software documentation, including security documentation. A major change may require a re-certification of the system and the application of the full SDLC, but regular maintenance activities should follow the Maintenance Lifecycle described in Appendix H. Any maintenance activities should ensure that the Section 508 accessibility standards be followed. The Maintenance Manual is used and updated accordingly. d. Disposition activities are the end of the system life cycle. Disposition activities are conducted when the information system requirement ceases to exist or when the system is replaced by a new or updated system. The activities ensure the orderly termination of the system and preserve vital information about the system so that some or all of it may be reactivated in the future if necessary. A disposition plan is prepared to address all facets of archiving, transferring and disposing of the system and the data. Particular emphasis is given to proper preservation of the data processed by the system so that the data is effectively migrated to another system or archived per applicable record management regulations and policies, for potential future access. The disposition activities preserve information not only about the current production system, but also about the evolution of the system through its life cycle. A number of decisions are made in this phase.

(1)

Project approach decisions include: (a) What evaluations of the system/data should be conducted? (b) What new or additional user support activities are needed? (c) What improvements in system/data functionality, quality, and/or performance are needed? (d) What adjustments to the system/data management approach are needed?

(2)

Project execution decisions include: (a) What changes/enhancements to the system/database(s) are needed? (b) Should a particular enhancement be implemented during this phase or given its own life cycle? (c) What will be the system termination date? (d) Which software components should be preserved? (e) Which data should be preserved? (f) What should be done with remaining equipment? (g) How should life cycle products be archived?

(3)

Project continuation decisions include: (a) Does the information system requirement continue to exist? (b) Does the production system address the requirement sufficiently to be continued in operation? (c) Are sufficient funding and other resources available for the remainder of the life cycle?

e. Review activities occur several times throughout this phase. Each time the system is reviewed, one of two decisions is made: either the system is continued in operation (with or without modifications) or the system is to be terminated, and its functions and data transferred to other systems. A post-deployment review (PDR) is conducted to ensure that the system functions as planned and expected; to verify that the system cost is within the estimated amount; and to verify that the intended benefits are derived as projected. The checklist at Exhibit 22 (Operations, Maintenance And Disposition Phase Review Checklist) is used for the PDR. Normally, this is a one-time review and it occurs after major deployment, but also after a major enhancement to the system. f. The Periodic System Review is also conducted in this phase and it is a continuous system review. The periodic system review is performed to evaluate system

performance, user satisfaction with the system, adaptability to changing business needs, and new technologies that might improve the system. The Operations, Maintenance and Disposition Issues Checklist may also be used to conduct the periodic system review. The periodic system review is diagnostic in nature and can lead to development or maintenance activities. Any major system modifications needed after the system has been implemented will follow the life cycle process from planning through deployment. A Project Management Plan, including feasibility study, will identify modification to system documentation (change pages) rather than new system documentation (e.g., Requirements Document, Design Document, etc.) The appropriate reviews and testing will be conducted, based on the scope of the modification. g. Prerequisites. The following are prerequisites for this phase: (1) SDLC baseline documentation; (2) Production software; (3) System hardware; (4) Operations schedule; (5) User service agreements; (6) Maintenance log; (7) Manuals; and, (8) Periodic re-certification and accreditation. 2.

ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION During this phase there are specific issues to be addressed. These issues are included in the checklist at Exhibit 22 (Operations, Maintenance And Disposition Phase Review Checklist). The checklist is used as a reference for the system developer to ensure objectives of this phase are met. The checklist is also used in conducting the postdeployment review and the periodic system review.

6.

REVIEW ACTIVITY The post-deployment review and periodic system review are performed during this final phase. The post-deployment review is conducted within six months after deployment of the system and ensures that the system functions as required, benefits are derived, and that the system is within the estimated costs. The periodic system review, however, is conducted as long as the system is in operation (continuously) to ensure that system performance is optimized and that the users are satisfied with the system. Conduct a user satisfaction review if appropriate. Participants for both reviews may include the project manager, System Owner, and user(s). Depending on the size and complexity of the system, the reviews may be conducted by a review team or an external independent team.

DOCUMENTATION a. Post-deployment Review Report. The post-deployment review is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system development after the system has been in production for a period of time. The objectives of this review are to: (1) Determine if the system does what it is suppose to do. (2) Determine whether the system supports the user as required in an effective and efficient manner. (3) Assess how successful the system is in terms of functionality, performance, and cost versus benefits. Assess the effectiveness of the life cycle development activities that produced the system. The review results can also be used to strengthen the system as well as system development procedures. The review is scheduled to follow the release of a system or system revision by an appropriate amount of time to allow determination of the effectiveness of the system. A representative from the functional development group or other member of the major user organization participates in the review. The System Owner ensures that all documentation needed for the review and that all personnel needed to participate in the review are accessible. The reviewer and an assigned team collect the information needed for the postdeployment review by interviewing end users and their managers, system administrators, and computer operations personnel. The report is then prepared and provided to the user organization requesting it and the information systems organization, which may jointly use the findings to initiate other actions. The post-deployment review is a free form report and not all paragraphs will be relevant or necessary to the final product. A description of the post-deployment review is outlined at Exhibit 23 (Post Deployment Review Outline). b. Plan of Action and Milestones. The security weaknesses discovered in any audits or critical infrastructure vulnerability assessments must be captured in a POA&M. The POA&M will identify tasks that need to be accomplished to correct these security weaknesses. It details resources required to accomplish the plan, any milestones in meeting the task, and scheduled completion dates for the milestones. The POA&M assists in identifying, prioritizing and monitoring the progress of corrective actions for security weaknesses found for a system. The plan needs to be updated on a quarterly basis. c. Periodic System Review Report. The purpose of the periodic system review is to assess the system's performance and user satisfaction. This review process occurs repeatedly to ensure that the system is performing cost-effectively and that it continues to meet the functional needs of the user. The report provides a description of the review process, its focus, and results. The report also may be used to document management approvals regarding further enhancements or development of the system under review. Depending on the timing and focus of the review, it may involve investigation of system response time, database capacity, newer technologies available, business functions,

and continued user satisfaction with the system. The periodic system review report is outlined at Exhibit 24 (Periodic System Review Report Outline). d. Disposition Plan. (1) The Disposition Plan is the most significant deliverable in the disposition of the information system and the plan will vary according to system and Bureau requirements. The objectives of the plan are to end the operation or the system in a planned, orderly manner and to ensure system components and data are properly archived or incorporated into other systems. At the end of this task, the system will no longer exist as an independent entity. The completion of the system life cycle is carefully planned and documented to avoid disruption of the organizations using the system, or of other systems that will use the data and/or software of the present system. An outline of the Disposition Plan is available at Exhibit 26 (Disposition Plan Outline). (2) The software, hardware, and data of the current system are disposed of per organization needs and pertinent laws and regulations. Software or data of the system may be transferred to other existing systems, migrated to an entirely new system, or archived for future use. Hardware is made available for future use, added to surplus, or discarded. (3) In conducting the disposition task, several items are to be considered: (a) All known users should be informed of the decision to terminate operation of the system before the actual termination date. (b) Although the current system may be terminated, in many cases the data will continue to be used through other systems. The specific processing logic used to transfer the data to another system is developed as part of the data conversion plan. (c) In some instances, software may be transferred to a replacement system. For example, a component of the current system may become a component of the replacement system without significant rewriting of programs. (d) Effective reactivation of the system in the future will depend heavily on having complete documentation. It is generally advisable to archive all documentation, including the life cycle products generated during the earliest tasks of the life cycle as well as the documentation for users and for operation and maintenance personnel. (e) The Disposition Plan addresses how the various components of the system are handled at the completion of operations, including software, data, hardware, communications, and documentation. The plan also notes any future access to the system. The plan is lead/performed by the OCIO Representative, supported by the records management staff, the project team and the functional staff and reviewed by the Quality Assurance manager. Other tasks include the following.

2.6 OTHER STAKEHOLDERS [Identify other stakeholders involved in the project including staff titles, roles, and responsibilities.] 3 PROJECT PHASES, TASKS AND WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE [Briefly describe what this section contains ­ Project phases, related activities and their schedule; list of major tasks and related work products/deliverables, resources; project phase and task interdependencies; Work Breakdown Structure.] 3.1 WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS) [The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a family tree structure that relates to products produced and tasks performed at the various phases of the project life cycle. The typical WBS products may consist of hardware products, services and life cycle products. A WBS displays and defines the product(s) to be developed or produced, and relates the elements of work (tasks) to be accomplished to each other and to the end product(s). Typically, the three types of WBS's developed during the system development process are summary, project, and contract. The summary WBS is the TTB Program WBS and is available on the TTB Process Asset Library.] 3.1.1 Project Work Breakdown Structure [The Project WBS is the detailed WBS that is used for the day-to-day management of a project. The Project WBS includes all important products and work elements, or tasks, of the project, regardless of whether these tasks are performed by the bureau or a contractor. The Project WBS may be modified, if necessary, during the life cycle. ­ Place it as an appendix. For a software system development project, the structure of the Project WBS should also reflect the Bureau's life cycle approach. The structure of the Project WBS may vary depending on the nature of the project, and should be customized by the bureau's project manager to reflect the particular project and the particular path through the life cycle. For example, a full-scale initial information system development project and a software conversion process would be expected to have somewhat different WBS's. Similarly, the Project WBS for an information system development project with a major hardware complement would differ from a software-only project.] 3.1.2 Contract Work Breakdown Structure [The Contract WBS (CWBS) is a further breakdown of the contract specific WBS that covers the products and work elements, or tasks, from Project WBS to be performed by a contractor. In addition to items derived from the Project WBS, the CWBS will have contractor specific items, which may not be reflected in the Project WBS. Depending on the nature of the project, the contractor may be responsible for a given part of the project development activities (for example, quality assurance), for a specific part of the development life cycle (for example, requirements definition), or for the entire development process. A preliminary CWBS is usually specified in the Acquisition Plan. The contract line items, configuration items, contract work statement tasks, contract specification, and contractor responses will typically be expressed in terms of the preliminary CWBS. Place it as an appendix, if applicable.]

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PLAN OUTLINE

1 INTRODUCTION [Identify the specific purpose and scope of the CM plan. Name and briefly describe the project covered by the CM plan. Include the name of the configuration manager for the system that will be responsible for establishing and maintaining the configuration management records for the system.] 2 CONFIGURATION IDENTIFICATION [Cite the project documents that identify and define the configuration baseline characteristics. Identify the following: a. Documentation that establishes the selected system baseline; b. Documentation and media defining code and documentation that are placed under configuration control, and the corresponding version, release, and change status of each deliverable item; and c. System components comprising the application system, to the module level. Configuration identification serves to clearly delineate the significant characteristics of the system, providing a common language, or referencing scheme, for describing the system. It is the delineation of specific configuration items that will enable all individuals involved in the evolution of the system to communicate effectively, using the common language. Examples of such characteristics include specific functional and data requirements, specific characteristics of the system design and system documentation.]

3 CONFIGURATION CONTROL [Identify approval/disapproval authority for changes, library controls, and the librarian used for the project. In addition, procedures for controlling the preparation and dissemination of changes to deliverable software and documentation that have been placed under configuration control. Specific change control and software control procedures are covered in detail. Change control is a process for determining what changes are to be made to the system. Change control requires the documentation of specific requests for modifications, and a review of the requested modifications, and consideration of their impact on the system, before they are made. Software control is a set of procedures to ensure that the integrity of the system is preserved when approved changes are being made to the system or in the event of a disaster and restoration of the system is needed. Software control procedures are particularly important during the operation phase of the life cycle. Software control ensures that changes to the computer programs are developed and tested using a copy of the programs and test database, and does not adversely affect users. However software control is also important during the development and deployment phases to control changes during the planning and installation of the system.]

[State the procedures for generating documentation that will provide traceable changes to controlled products and communicate the status of configuration items to management. Identify data content and format of accounting records, and their frequency and distribution. Configuration accounting is an administrative procedure for maintaining system baselines and monitoring the status of the system throughout the life cycle. The configuration accounting procedure may also include documentation for use by the project team throughout the life cycle.] 5 CONFIGURATON AUDITS [State the procedures for preparation and execution of audits for establishing the tracing of requirements identified for the project. The procedures identify what will be certified and provided to management for approval. Configuration audits are examinations of the products and related documents submitted for inclusion in a baseline to assure that they are complete, clearly presented, and internally consistent. This examination is oriented to adherence to guidance and standards. These audits support reviews and evaluations of the system by ensuring that required products and documents are complete and provide effective trace ability to related products. Audits do not evaluate qualitatively the programmatic and/or technical content of the product. This is done by other reviews and other quality assurance activities. Audits help ensure that the resources used to conduct reviews and evaluations are not applied to products that are not yet ready for the review.] 5.1 FUNCTIONAL CONFIGURATION AUDIT (FCA) [Describe the point at which an FCA will be completed and the process to be followed. An FCA is a means of validating that the developer (contractor) has completed the system per the requirement definition. The FCA ensures that technical documentation and test analysis/reports accurately reflect the functional, operational, and performance characteristics specified.] 5.2 PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION AUDIT (PCA) [Describe the point at which a PCA will be completed and the process that will be followed. The PCA is a means for validating the system baseline. The PCA ensures that configuration items are developed as specified in the design documents; that the items are tested and verified and/or validated successfully and that any differences are resolved.] 6 PROBLEM REPORTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTION [Describe the procedures for reporting, prioritizing, tracking, and resolving problems that result from reviews, audits, and tests.]

7 TOOLS, TECHNIQUES, AND METHODOLOGIES [Identify the automated tools, techniques, and methodologies to be used to support configuration management.]

Address risks from theft, disclosure, unauthorized access, eavesdropping, programmed attacks, misrouting, misplacement, erasure and accidental damage considerations. Security requirements are further defined when completing the system security and integrity requirement worksheets in the risk assessment and the requirements are also cross-referenced in the contingency plan as appropriate. The system's minimum security requirements are based on the results of the system categorization which was performed earlier in the lifecycle. Reference the system's categorization and identify the minimum security requirements associated with that categorization. Additionally, define any other requirements beyond the minimum that are particular to the system in question.] 6. QUALITY ASSURANCE [For each quality factor, the system developer should provide a brief explanation of its importance. The system developer works with the user to identify the most appropriate quality factors. In addition, for each quality factor not selected, provide a brief explanation for not selecting that quality factor. For example, for a particular financial system the correctness and integrity quality factors may be important to ensure that the system is implemented as specified and to prevent theft of data that could lead to financial fraud. For the same financial system, the verifiability quality factor may also be important to verify the system's performance. If the Bureau's development staff expect to reuse certain system functions in future systems, then the reusability quality factor would be important. In addition, other quality factors might be applicable, depending on the system to be developed. Therefore the most important quality factors would be selected for developing the system. All members involved in creating the FRD should consider the following fifteen quality factors when determining and documenting the system requirements. By selecting and referring to these quality factors, requirements analysts may begin to document expectations and standards that will facilitate the development of a high quality system. The following quality factors can apply to any system.] 6.1. CORRECTNESS [Extent to which all specified functions are implemented, the design is documented according to standards, and the software's performance is within the criteria set for performance.] 6.2. EFFICIENCY [The resources needed to provide the required functionality are affordable.] 6.3. EXPANDABILITY [Enhancing the software's functionality or performance is easy.] 6.4. FLEXIBILITY [Modifying the software for different environments requires little more than a user interface or change of data, without resorting to expandability-type changes.] 6.5. INTEGRITY [Assurance that the software and data are not being tampered with or stolen and that the software is performing updates appropriately.] 6.6. INTEROPERABILITY

2.1 LIMITATIONS [Describe constraints imposed on the testing, whether they are due to lack of specialized test equipment or constraints on time or resources. Indicate what steps are being taken to reduce the program risk due to the test limitation(s).] 2.2 TRACEABILITY [Enhance the requirements tracing matrix created in the RD to include testing activities that address user requirements. This matrix begins with the business requirements and assists in tracing how the requirements are addressed in subsequent phases and documents, including the design document and test plans. The matrix may be broken up into segments, if appropriate. For example, a separate matrix of the test plan paragraphs that trace to particular paragraphs in the design document in the design phase may be provided. The intent is to show that the test design tests all of the functionality, performance, and other requirements associated with each design element (unit, module, subsystem, and system) in the design document. When a test supports a particular requirement, the relationship is noted at their intersection in the matrix. The listed requirements may be explicitly stated, or may be derived or implicit. All explicit requirements must be included. The granularity of the list should be detailed enough that each requirement is simple and testable.] 3 TEST PLANS [Describe the levels of tests that take place during development: unit, integration, and system level tests and the planning that are needed.

accuracy, validity, completeness, and usability. During this test, the software performance, response time, and ability to operate under stressed conditions will be tested. External system interfaces are also tested. All findings are recorded in a test analysis report.] 3.1.4 System Acceptance Test [This test is performed in an environment that "mirrors" as much as practicable the environment in which the system will be fielded. The environment is a non-production environment. Every feature of the system may be tested for correctness and conformance to functional requirements. System interoperability, all documentation, system reliability, and the level to which the system meets user requirements will be evaluated. Performance tests may be executed to ensure that screen response time, program run time, operator intervention requirements and overall system operations meet user requirements. Recovery and restart procedures may be evaluated. Interfaces to other applications should be tested here as well.

PERIODIC SYSTEM REVIEW REPORT OUTLINE

1 INTRODUCTION [Provide a brief description of introductory material in this paragraph. Whenever appropriate, other information may be added.] 1.1 PURPOSE [Describe the purpose of the periodic system review report. Provide the name and identifying information about the system reviewed. Provide the timing of the review to differentiate the periodic system review reports created in the life of a system.] 1.2 SCOPE [Delineate the boundaries of the system review. Since this review may address initial production performance and/or continued user satisfaction with the system, describe the specific aspects of the review conducted.] 1.3 PROJECT REFERENCES [Provide a bibliography of key project references produced for this system.] 1.4 POINTS OF CONTACT [Identify the sponsoring bureau organization. Provide the name of the responsible organization(s) and titles of the staff that conducted the system review.] 1.5 GLOSSARY [Provide a glossary of all terms and abbreviations used in the report that may be unfamiliar to the reader. If it is several pages in length, it may be placed as an appendix.] 2 REVIEW PROCESS [Provide an overview of the review process and its approach. This information may differ, depending on whether the system review focused on performance, user satisfaction, or both.] 2.1 SYSTEM OVERVIEW [Provide a general overview of the system reviewed. Examples of information that would be relevant to this paragraph include: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j) (k) System name; Date of initial deployment; Date of latest modification; Type of system (e.g., administrative, financial); Type of processing (batch, on-line, transaction processing); System diagram and narrative description; Number of computer programs within the system; Programming language(s) and database management systems used; Processing frequency; Total monthly processing hours; and Review.

Expand this list as necessary to include all important aspects of the system relevant to the system review. It is not necessary to provide information on all of the items in the list above if they are not relevant to the review]. 2.2 FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND DATA USAGE [Describe what the system does functionally and how the data is used by the system.] 2.3 PERFORMANCE REVIEW [Depending on the purpose of the review, address system response, capacity, correctness, and other pertinent performance factors.] 2.3.1 System Response [To evaluate the responsiveness of the system, it may be appropriate to turn on a system monitor on mainframe-based systems. For example, for a transaction processing system, data on the number of times each system's programs have been executed during a workday, week, or month should be collected as appropriate. The monitor may also provide data on the average and worst-case delay experienced by the program, and the average and worst case queue lengths. To evaluate the responsiveness of the system for LAN-based systems, it may be appropriate to place a monitor or protocol analyzer on the LAN.] 2.3.2 System Capacity [Examine the capacity of the system reviewed to determine whether any performance limitations result from operating the system near the limits of its capacity. For example, for mainframe computer applications using a DBMS, lack of main memory or selection of inappropriate buffer sizing during system generation could result in excessive disk reads and writes that would slow the applications' response. Similarly, a lack of adequate excess hard disk storage could result in large queues at disk controllers, substantially slowing the actual, observed average disk access time. On LAN-based systems, hosting all applications on a server with only one large disk drive and controller could lead to bottlenecks in performance for LAN-based applications. In addition, there may be simple system capacity considerations, such as in an application hosted on a system that has only enough hard disk space available for a limited number of data records.] 2.3.3 System Correctness [Depending on the purpose of the review, it may be appropriate to examine the correctness of the system calculations, output, and reports. Presumably, this was done during unit testing and system testing. The intent of examining correctness during the periodic system review is to determine that the system is operating correctly with actual operational data inputs - since the operational data may differ somewhat from the test data. Examples of items to be evaluated include: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j) Values used for case codes; Correctness of field definitions; Values within data fields; Combinations of data fields; Calculations; Missing data; Extraneous data; Amounts; Units; Logic paths and decisions;

(k) Limits or reasonableness checks; (l) Signs; (m) Cross-footing of quantitative data; (n) Control totals; and (o) Alternate formats for accessibility. If the system maintains an audit trail log of hardware and software failures, examine this log to determine the failure modes of the system.] 2.3.4 Other [Discuss the approach to any performance issues that are not easily categorized under the topics listed above.] 2.4 USER SATISFACTION REVIEW [A user satisfaction review determines the effectiveness, correctness, and ease of use of the system from the users' perspective. If appropriate, this review can be used at any point during the information system life cycle. Summarize the results of the review.] 3 FINDINGS [Describe the major findings, results, or conclusions of the review. The intent is to provide management information for decision-making about the system under review. Rank or prioritize the findings by importance, if applicable. Otherwise, group them logically, as appropriate. The ranking, prioritizing, or grouping facilitates making a logical linkage to paragraph 4, which provides recommendations regarding the findings. Provide as much detail as necessary to describe the findings clearly and support the recommendations. The following list provides some examples of information that might be included in this paragraph: (a) References to supporting statistics or reports. What and where short-term problem areas exist (e.g., missing tapes, misrouted material); (b) What and where long-term problem areas exist (e.g., machine capacity problems); and (c) References to meetings, interviews, and surveys conducted, with a description of their results or outcomes.] 4 RECOMMENDATIONS [Present the recommendations derived from the findings of the system review. These recommendations should be phrased as proposals for management consideration and approval. Depending on the purpose and scope of the specific system review as defined by bureau management, it may be appropriate to provide multiple, alternative recommendations for the findings. If alternative recommendations are provided, then describe the advantages, disadvantages, costs, trade-offs, etc., associated with each alternative. Rank, prioritize, or group the recommendations logically, as appropriate. Relate the ranking, prioritization, or grouping of the recommendations to that of the findings in paragraph 3 above.] 5 APPROVALS AND APPENDICES [Reference any management approvals and include any appendices needed to support the periodic system review report.]

Status Report - A periodic (monthly) comparison of planned versus actual performance. Subtask - A sub-division of a task, also called a step. System Owner - The Directorate/Executive Office that principally funds and uses the system developed or under development. Systems Development Life Cycle - The phases through which an information system passes from beginning to end. -TTask - A well defined piece of work that appears at the lowest level of detail of the project's work breakdown structure. The task begins at the start of the project, or upon completion of its predecessors, and has an estimated duration as well as a resource allocation. The task culminates with a milestone, an output that signifies the completion of the effort. Technical Specifications - The underlying technical requirements which make it possible to meet the customer's functional specifications. Test Plan - A plan containing specifications, descriptions, and procedures for testing the end product, i.e., the system. This plan is normally developed during the requirements definition phase and revised in later phases. Test Phase - The fifth phase of the life cycle. In this phase the programs completed during the development phase are tested under a system acceptability test (SAT) to determine if the system accomplishes its objectives. Traceability - To maintain a recorded path between life cycle phases. Training Plan - The Office of the Chief Information Officer, in collaboration with the Office of Training and Professional Development, outlines objectives, needs, strategy, and curriculum to be addressed in training users on new or enhanced information systems, and presents activities needed to support its development. -UUser - A user is the individual or office for whom the system is being developed. Also an organizational or programmatic entity that receives information processing services from an information processing services organization. -VVariance - The difference, in time, dollars, person hours, and quality between the master plan baseline and the actual performance of the project team, as of a specific reporting date. -WWalkthrough - A highly structured meeting to review the completeness and quality of selected module(s) of the system, or of the entire system.

APPENDIX D. AUTOMATED TOOLS
Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) technology is an automated engineering discipline for project management, software development, and maintenance. It includes automated structured methodologies and automated tools. Automated tools vary in cost, complexity of use and suitability to the task, and the market changes rapidly. It is suggested that an information systems group that wishes to purchase an automated tool first contact others who have used this tool. Another alternative is to purchase or reference a publication that reviews software and hardware. These publications may be in the form of monthly periodicals with a low subscription rate and a narrow band of subject items or in the form of costly and extensive binders containing a wealth of information on hardware, software and technology updates. When selecting a package, evaluate its capability regarding: 1. Number of tasks allowed - Does it accommodate the number of tasks in your project? 2. Number of resources allowed - Does it accommodate the number of personnel and material items? 3. Subproject capability - Can the software divide large projects into smaller ones? 4. PERT/CPM - Does the software use PERT or CPM? 5. Import/export capability - Can access to other software packages be made from within this package? 6. Network diagram scaling capability - Can the diagrams be reduced to computer screen size? 7. Presentation graphics capability - Are the graphics easy to use and flexible?

APPENDIX E. PROTOTYPING
1. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW. Since the beginning of systems development, experience has shown that frequently after a system has been designed, developed, tested, and implemented, the users find that it is not what they really wanted, or the system does not work the way they intended it to. As a means of preventing this, the practice of prototyping a system is becoming more and more widespread to define a system's functional requirements. A prototype of a new system is simply a working "model" of the system. Such a model might range from reproducing or simulating only selected functions or processes described in the functional requirements, up to a fully functional model. Even fully functional, a prototype should not be a developed system containing actual code that could be validated and put into production. If it were, it would be defeating the purpose of prototyping, which is rapid development of an easily modified model. Typically prototyping is used today for online systems development. This is because the user is intimately involved in the operation of an interactive online system with its data entry and retrieval through screen displays. One way to build prototypes is to use specialized tools that aid in developing them. It should be noted that, increasingly, these tools have the capability of automatically generating code once the design is finalized. Another popular approach is to use a fourth generation language that facilitates the building of prototypes; and then use third generation language for greater efficiency in the production system's code. Prototyping can be useful in all of the initial phases of the life cycle. In the planning phase, prototyping might be used in finalizing the feasibility study and updating the cost-benefit analysis. However, probably the most important benefits are found in using prototyping during the requirements definition and design phases. Prototyping is an entirely new dimension in system design and development. It is not possible to predict every case where prototyping can be useful or provide illustrations of every case. If designers are aware of prototyping, greater use of prototyping should follow as they see new and expanded ways to build prototypes. 2. OBJECTIVES AND BENEFITS. The objectives of this discussion is to provide an awareness of the benefits of prototyping, to give a description of prototyping levels, and to state some of the functions to be sought in tools that facilitate prototyping. Some of the benefits of prototyping are: a. Users and programmer analysts can see early in the life cycle what the new system will do and look like so that they verify requirements through direct experience with the planned system. b. A prototype can be developed in far less time than developing the full system.

c. Modifications and changes in the design are far less costly and much easier to make here than in the development phase. d. The prototype is a dynamic model to allow for changes in requirements during their development. e. Alternative approaches can be physically seen and experimented with. 3. LEVELS OF PROTOTYPING. a. Screens Only. The most common form of prototyping is in the development of screens for online systems. A simple prototype of a screen for users and programmer analysts might allow them only to view it on a terminal and see if it contains the necessary fields, in their correct position, and in color - if available. Sophisticated prototypes would not only let users and programmer analysts view the screen, but would permit interactive modification of the screen as they look at it. b. Screens and Data Editing. The most sophisticated screen prototype would do all of the above, and would allow programmer analysts to include editing rules and screen messages so that users could actually input the kind of data they would to the real system, and the prototype would respond the way the real system would. c. Basic Working Model. At the next level, the prototype would be capable of performing input/output functions. A model of the database would be accessible and one could simulate adding, updating, and deleting records. If the system were to have query or reporting functions, these would be modeled at this level. d. Full Function Model. The full function model would be able to duplicate all of the desired processes of the system, but would do so in "miniature" or as a facsimile only. In general, users and programmer analysts should progress upward through these levels of prototyping one at a time. There should be full agreement on screen layout before moving to the basic working model and this level should be fully completed before attempting a full functional model. As obvious as this may seem, the mistake is often made to leap directly into developing a full-scale model before such fundamental items as input format have been completely defined. 4. PROTOTYPING AND THE SYSTEM LIFE CYCLE METHODOLOGY. Oftentimes, in the traditional life cycle methodology, after a need has been perceived, and a request for a new system has passed through strategic planning and the planning phase, a project manager and user prepare functional requirements in the requirements definition phase. While the requirements are drawn up with input from the users in this phase, sometimes users are excluded from the actual writing of the requirements. The next user involvement is approval of the requirements in the requirement document. The users are presented with a completed document and asked to say whether the system described is what they originally wanted. Most often they do not have the information systems background needed to understand the technical language of the written functional requirements, and they are not sure they understand the non-technical areas either.

with this, users typically sign-off on the requirements hoping the system is going to be what they want, but far from sure that it will be. When this approach is followed, it comes as no surprise that users frequently find that the system is not what they expected; or that while it is what they originally wanted, their needs changed during the time the design was out of their sight. Prototyping is one way to avoid this. It does not require a change in the life cycle phases ­ just a modification of what happens in the phases. Paramount to the concept of prototyping is that user involvement becomes the primary consideration. The goal is to develop system functional requirements that absolutely meet the users' needs and expectations. Within the requirements definition phase, there could be an imbedded mini-cycle that could be called a prototyping development life cycle. This mini-cycle has phases of its own: (1) specify requirements; (2) build model; (3) demonstrate model; and (4) evaluate model. This cycle is repeated as often as necessary until the functional requirements have been refined to ensure they are accurate and complete. 5. PITFALLS OF PROTOTYPING. There are no disadvantages of prototyping that would rule out its use - its value in defining precise and accurate functional requirements is enormous yet there are two things that could be pitfalls if not handled correctly. a. The user must understand that this is a prototype only. What the user sees, the user could mistake for the real system, and not realize that development of the actual system will take some additional time - perhaps considerable additional time. Care must be exercised to avoid the "I can see it, why can't I have it now?" problem. b. In developing a prototype, it is necessary to build in realistic response time. If, in the prototype, the user sees almost instantaneous response; the user is sure to be upset later when the actual system has a response time of many seconds, especially when the system is being heavily used. 6. ALTERNATIVES TO PROTOTYPING. As an alternative to prototyping, the project team may consider scheduling product demos during the Development Phase. Similar to prototyping, this allows users to see completed modules and provide feedback in advance of the formal acceptance testing. Whereas the development of a prototype requires additional work during the planning, requirements definition, and/or design phases, product demos can usually be scheduled during the development phase without any extra time having to be built into the schedule. The cost of requirements/design changes during the development phase, however, is greater than in earlier phases, but still less than during the test phase. When considering scheduling product demonstrations the OCIO Representative and Project Manager must also consider the risk of introducing scope creep. Showing the users the product at this stage can easily result in additional requests that would be better deferred to future maintenance releases.

APPENDIX F. SMALL-SCALE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS
A Project Manager may be authorized to use these guidelines for the development of smallscale systems or for enhancements to existing systems that require less than 6 person months of work effort to develop. The life cycle methodology has been tailored by compressing seven phases into three, and requiring fewer products than the traditional life cycle methodology. 1. INTRODUCTION. a. Guidelines for small-scale development efforts. This guideline may be used for system development or enhancement efforts that require minimal enterprise-wide resources and work-power. Local microcomputer applications typically fit this category. The sponsoring organization may request to deviate from the full systems development life cycle phases and documentation requirements in situations where the development effort will take less than a total of six person months and/or costs less than $250,000. This deviation should be annotated on the Request For Change (RFC) form when submitted for approval via the Bureau's Enterprise Configuration Control Board (E-CCB). After project approval by the E-CCB, the Project Manager documents the decision to use this guideline in the project folder. In practice, procedures to determine project size are not very precise. b. Life cycle phases and products. Even though this guideline applies to systems with relatively short development timeframes, the small-scale project goes through development phases similar to those for development of a large-scale system. In addition, formal user involvement continues to be a mandatory part of each life cycle phase review. There are some differences, however. The phases of the small-scale life cycle methodology overlap and are of shorter duration than in the full-scale methodology. In addition, life cycle products are combined in the small-scale project, and its life cycle reviews are fewer, may be more informal, and have fewer participants. DPAFs are prepared and signed for all lifecycle deliverables and for the delivered system. EPAFs are prepared and signed at the conclusion of the Planning/Requirements Definition phase and the Design/Development Phase.

Within the planning/requirements phase, there can be imbedded a mini-cycle called the prototyping life cycle. The mini-cycle steps are: (a) Specify Requirements - Analyze user requirements. (b) Build Model - Use an application generator to develop a prototype of the main portion of the user's required capability. (c) Demonstrate Model - Demonstrate the prototype to the user and identify improvements needed. Repeat this cycle a specified number of times until the user is satisfied and the functional requirements are clearly defined. (d) Evaluate Model - If the user is satisfied with the performance of the prototype system, it may be established as the user's system. All documentation must be developed including the Users Manual and Design Document. The final prototype cycle can be considered the system acceptance test if an adequate test plan is prepared prior to the final cycle and a test analysis statement is completed to document user acceptance is completed. 3. REQUIREMENTS REVIEW. A requirement review is conducted to reach agreement on the identification of user requirements, project activities and schedules, and the acceptability of the proposed automated solution. The system owner and the Project Manager acknowledge agreement on work schedules, system benefits being commensurate with estimated costs, and the expected functionality of the system. Any organization providing technical, quality assurance, or security support should review and concur with the Requirements Document. The OCIO Representative is responsible for resolving any issues raised by these organizations. The requirement review may be the final JAD or prototyping session. 4. DESIGN/DEVELOPMENT PHASE. a. Activities. During this phase: (1) Proposed system structure and interfaces are developed; (2) System is partitioned into design units using; (a) Structure charts

TEST READINESS REVIEW. The system developer conducts at least one system test before the system is given to the user for a System Acceptance Test. After the unit and system tests are conducted, the Project Manager conducts a Test Readiness Review with the system owner. This review is conducted to ensure that the system and associated User Manual, to include related software support documentation, are ready for the System Acceptance Test. Quality Assurance staff may participate in this review to verify that the system documentation is in place and that there is evidence of appropriate unit and system testing. 6. TEST/DEPLOYMENT PHASE.

APPENDIX G. CAPACITY MANAGEMENT & PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PROGRAM
These guidelines establish procedures to measure and manage the capacity and performance of information systems equipment and software. All Bureaus are required to establish and maintain an information systems capacity management and performance measurement program and use this program in the information systems planning and acquisition process. The objectives of a capacity management/performance measurement program include: 1. Information systems which are responsive to the mission, goals and security requirements of the organizations they support; 2. Improved productivity within the Bureau through the measured and controlled application of information systems resources to the processing of present and forecast workload; 3. Optimal performance of equipment and software as a result of continuously monitoring and analyzing information system resource utilization; 4. Maintenance of agreed upon levels of service in terms of response time, transaction volume, and cost between users and managers of information systems; 5. Acquisition plans based on workload forecasts; 6. Cost and productivity data on which to base cost-benefit analysis of current and projected processing; 7. Timely corrective action in the event of declining reliability of systems or components; and 8. Closer working relationships and improved exchange of information between users and managers of information systems resources. 9. Training plan is based on requirements tracing and needs and skill analysis. 10. Guidelines for a capacity management and performance measurement program include: a. Introduction. An information systems organization has a finite amount of capacity to process a given workload. This capacity results from the configuration of equipment and resident software that can be adjusted or incremented to increase the amount of workload that can be processed. Performance is the rate at which workload is processed by an information system and includes measurements of volume and of time. A capacity management program must incorporate the measurement and evaluation of performance as well as the projection of future workload and performance requirements for planning purposes. Information systems are designed to provide functions required by an organization in the performance of its mission. (1) Purpose. These guidelines address both the technical and the managerial aspects of capacity management/performance measurement and are intended only to outline the major elements of a complete program. Detailed deployment

plans must be developed applying these guidelines to each information systems environment. While capacity management/performance measurement requires the use of technical tools and the understanding of ADP concepts, it should not be treated as simply a technical program. In addition to guiding the system manager in the day-to-day management of resources, it will also provide important input to information systems plans and budgets. Measurement data must be appropriately presented to managers to enable them to make information systems decisions from a business perspective. (2) Program Requirements. A capacity management/performance measurement program must include: (a) Establishment of performance objectives; (b) Measurement of actual or projected performance; (c) Analysis and presentation of performance measurement results; (d) Analysis of costs and value associated with performance levels; and (e) Adjustment of capacity when appropriate to meet performance and/or costbenefit objectives. (3) Use of Data. Stacks of system performance printouts that are never examined are pointless. In addition, a program is ineffective if utilization and performance trends are not routinely presented to management for decisions regarding the allocation of resources.

b. Management of the Program. (1) Planning. A plan for capacity management/performance measurement should address objectives, the current environment, and changes required for objective accomplishment. The objectives for any such program should include those outlined in the previous paragraph, as well as others that address the Bureaus' particular goals and vulnerabilities. The plan should outline activities and responsibilities, which will provide continuous management of information resources to meet the business goals of the Bureau. The emphasis in the plan should be on activities to avoid crises, as well as on appropriate reaction to unanticipated events. Planning should address each of the following areas described below. (a) Performance Measurement. A program for capacity management must begin with an established baseline that states both the workload that is being processed and the time required for processing. Workload can usually be described in terms of volume of input and its source. Time factors vary with the type of workload. Batch transactions are processed at a certain rate per hour while interactive transactions are processed with a certain response time to the user as well as at a certain rate.

(b) Performance Evaluation. When the performance baseline has been established, it can be evaluated in terms of reasonableness in relation to expected performance for the system and its components. The adequacy of performance to support the Bureaus' mission objectives should be assessed. (c) Cost-Benefit Analysis. Information system capacity must be managed per the value to be obtained from costs incurred. The measurement of system performance when applied to operating costs becomes the basis for work unit costs. The benefit/cost ratio should be considered in making any decision to increase capacity or improve performance. (d) System Service Objectives. After existing performance has been measured and evaluated, objectives should be set for delivery of service to the users. These objectives should be stated in terms of workload and time and must be negotiated with users and documented in service level agreements. Performance priorities for systems should be established with reference to business plan priorities and critical success factors. Whether or not users are charged for service, they should be made to understand the costs associated with alternative service levels and should be prepared to justify, based on value to be realized, requirements for more costly service levels. For systems already in existence, negotiating service level agreements may consist simply of documenting actual performance. If that performance is not considered to be acceptable, an analysis of the cost and benefit of improving it is required before a decision is made and a new service level agreement is agreed upon. (e) Monitoring Performance. Performance of each equipment and software installation must be continually monitored to identify any failure to achieve agreed upon service levels as well as to identify system components which are becoming bottlenecks, declining in reliability, or otherwise affecting performance. Trends in workload volume and type should also be identified by the monitoring function. The information required and the systems to capture and report it must be identified and the appropriate tools acquired. (f) Projecting Capacity Requirements. In addition to performance monitoring, consideration should be given to modeling and simulation techniques to estimate future capacity requirements when significant changes in the nature of the workload are anticipated. (g) Reporting to Management. Periodic reports showing, for example, actual performance versus performance objectives, problems, potential problems, and proposed solutions should be made available to management. Exception reporting is desirable. These reports should present capacity and performance in terms of workload and cost so that the manager can assess the impact of capacity management decisions on the accomplishment of the mission and goals of the Bureau. (h) Response to New Initiatives. Whenever a new application is planned, a service level agreement for that application should be negotiated with the

user. The service level agreement is one requirement to be addressed in system design and acquisition planning. (i) Acquisition Planning. All acquisitions of equipment and software should be planned based on measurements and projections of required capacity and performance. Acquisition planning to enhance or replace equipment saturation should allow sufficient time for following procurement regulations and installing equipment. A capacity management plan should establish capacity measures which, when attained, will cause acquisition plans and actions to be initiated. 1 Cost. The cost of an acquisition must be justified in terms of the value to be realized from increased information system capacity and/or improved performance. While other factors, such as physical obsolescence or new functionality, may dictate new acquisitions, present and projected workload and performance requirements should be the basis on which a given processing capacity is specified. Planning must address raw volumes as well as the type of processing to be provided, the system design features desired, the software to be employed, etc., to ensure that adequate capacity is specified. Requirements. The requirements for equipment and for software should always include mechanisms for monitoring capacity and performance in the operational environment to allow evaluation of the product's ability to perform according to requirements, as well as its adequacy as the operating environment changes.

2

(j) Staffing. An adequate capacity management/performance validation program requires a trained and experienced personnel to administer technical tools, analyze data, and inform management of the issues. (2) Service Level Agreements. Negotiation of service level agreements and decisions regarding configuration of information systems resources to deliver specific performance levels require the participation of both system and user management. Capacity Management in Contractor Owned Facilities. A capacity management/performance validation program is applicable to information systems support performed through contractor owned facilities and should be provided for in the contract. Information Sharing. Managers of capacity management and performance validation programs are encouraged to keep in contact with one another, both within the Bureau and with other public and private organizations with such programs, for the purpose of sharing experience and techniques.

Introduction. A variety of types of tools and techniques are available for capacity management and performance measurement. Some of them will combine two or more functions and certain functions will be performed by components whose primary purpose is not capacity management/performance measurement. While not all tools and techniques are applicable in every situation, the functionality of each should be considered in developing a program. Job Accounting System. This tool is used to collect and present information about the operation and costs of jobs that are processed by a configuration of equipment and software. Chargeback System. This tool is used to distribute the costs of data processing to those who use it in support of the performance of the organizational mission. Hardware/Software Monitor. These tools (consisting of equipment attached to the computer system and internally loaded software) provide data which can be used to optimize the configuration, improve throughput, determine resource utilization, determine character of workload, improve response time or turnaround, and develop a system model. Program Analyzer. This tool is used to identify and analyze those programs and procedures so that optimization techniques can be applied. Operations Control. This tool is used to inform system operators of capacity usage during routine processing so that adjustments can be made immediately if warranted by declining performance. Simulators/Modelers. These tools are used to design a system model which can be altered to reflect differing information systems scenarios in terms of workload to be processed, type of processing to be performed, and system configuration. For each model developed, they can produce projections from which information system resource needs are derived. Benchmarking. This is a technique for measuring the performance of a system to create a point of reference from which follow-on measurements can be analyzed. Most commonly, benchmarking is used to measure the capacity and performance of a newly acquired system to determine that it meets the stated requirements. A benchmark can also be revised, run, and the results compared to the original to measure the impact of changes to workload over the life of a system, or it can be rerun with a changed configuration to determine the effectiveness of the change.

d. Conclusion. A capacity management/performance measurement program for information systems does not involve new resource management concepts. The program manager must emphasize the management aspects of the program while providing adequate technical facilities. As with any information system project, the technology must not be allowed to stand in the way of sound business practice.

APPENDIX H. MAINTENANCE LIFECYCLE

1. INTRODUCTION. a. A Project Manager may be authorized to use these guidelines for regular system maintenance initiatives. Major enhancements may require the application of the full SDLC. The E-CCB makes the final determination as to the lifecycle requirements for a systems maintenance initiative. b. Life cycle phases and products. Even though this guideline applies to systems with relatively short development timeframes, the maintenance project goes through development phases similar to those for development of a large-scale system. In addition, formal user involvement continues to be a mandatory part of the life cycle. c. The maintenance life cycle methodology has been tailored by compressing lifecycle activities and requiring fewer products than the traditional life cycle methodology. The Maintenance Lifecycle is similar to the Small-Scale Development Lifecycle, however, distinct phase-to-phase transitions are removed. As a result, EPAFS are not required for the maintenance lifecycle. DPAFs are prepared and signed for all lifecycle deliverables and for the delivered system. d. The majority of maintenance projects will be scheduled in advance as part of regular system maintenance cycles. Trouble tickets and enhancement requests are collected between releases and used to define the scope of the next release. Maintenance projects may also be initiated on an as-needed basis when a critical fix is needed or when a new high-priority requirement arises. e. The Maintenance Lifecycle may be further tailored to meet the scope of the particular effort. The Maintenance Lifecycle Waiver Request should be submitted to document and gain approval of any lifecycle tailoring. See Exhibit 28. 2. PLANNING/REQUIREMENTS a. Activities. At the outset of the maintenance initiative, the following activities are performed: (1) Project management strategy is developed; (2) The Project Team is identified; (3) Open trouble tickets and enhancement requests are reviewed to determine project scope; (4) User requirements are identified; (5) Life cycle and test activities are defined; and,

(6) Project schedules are established. b. Deliverables. (1) Maintenance Requirements Document (MRD). The Maintenance Requirements Document is the only deliverable required for this stage. The MRD follows a similar format to the full Requirements Document, but focuses on the new and modified functional requirements for the maintenance release. Any changes to existing User Performance, Security, and QA requirements are also documented. The Maintenance Requirements Document outline is available in Exhibit 27. 3. REQUIREMENTS REVIEW. A requirement review is conducted to reach agreement on the identification of user requirements, project activities and schedules, and the acceptability of the proposed automated solution. The system owner and the Project Manager acknowledge agreement on work schedules, system benefits being commensurate with estimated costs, and the expected functionality of the system. Any organization providing technical, quality assurance, or security support should review and concur with the Maintenance Requirements Document. The OCIO Representative is responsible for resolving any issues raised by these organizations. 4. DESIGN/DEVELOPMENT. a. Activities. The following design and development activities are performed: (1) New/modified proposed system structure and interfaces are designed; (2) New/modified modules are coded; (3) Test Plan is updated; (4) Unit and system tests are conducted; (5) The Software Version Description is composed; (6) Acceptance test readiness is determined (7) User Manual is updated (if necessary); and, (8) Maintenance Manual is updated (if necessary). Other existing SDLC documents should be updated as well if appropriate. b. Deliverables. (1) Software Version Description (SVD). This document captures the updated system configurations and any design changes. The SVD outline is available in Exhibit 25. The SVD includes:

(3) Test Plan/Procedures. The existing Test Plan is updated to reflect the strategy for testing the maintenance release. An emphasis is placed on testing the new and modified functionality. The strategy for regression testing unchanged functionality is also documented. If desired, a new Test Plan for the maintenance release may be delivered rather than an update of the existing Test Plan. (4) Maintenance Manual. The existing Maintenance Manual is updated to document any changes to: (a) The information necessary to maintain the system effectively; (b) The software support environment; (c) The roles and responsibilities of maintenance personnel; and, (d) The regular activities essential to the support and maintenance of program modules, job streams, and database structures. 5. LOGICAL DATA MODEL REVIEW. If the maintenance effort includes database changes, the Data Management team conducts at least one logical data model review. This review is conducted to ensure that the system complies with TTB data management standards. If design changes are minor, the data management team may elect to review only the new DDL and DML scripts. 6. TEST/DEPLOYMENT. a. Activities.

TTB IT Security Rules of Behavior
U.S. Government systems are for authorized use only. Use of the TTB systems constitutes consent to monitoring, interception, recording, reading, copying or capturing by authorized personnel of all activities. NOTE: These IT Security Rules of Behavior are applicable to all individuals with access to TTB information systems 1. Do not access information systems or sensitive data without proper authorization. Use the TTB F 7200.1 Information Systems Access Form to make requests for any information system access (http://ttbweb/forms/pdf/f72001.pdf) Do not access, browse, research, or change any account, file, data, record, or application not required to perform your official duties. You are prohibited from performing any of the aforementioned actions for personal interest. If you have a legitimate need to conduct official business, and have been granted access to the system, you may access, research, or change the account, file, record, or application only to the extent required to conduct your official business. Protect employee privacy rights. You should consider the effects of your actions on the privacy of individuals. As an example, TTB personnel may have private phone numbers or birth date data on the TTB Intraweb. Taking this data outside of TTB may be a violation of an employee's privacy rights. Protect all of your authentication credentials (username and password) from disclosure. You are responsible for any computer activity associated with your username. Do not share your username and password with any other individuals, regardless of their position in or outside of TTB. Authentication credentials must be distributed and reset using a secure process. Do not accept a password unless you feel it was delivered in a secure manner. If given the option, immediately change your password after initial logon to any information system. Do not program your authentication credentials into automatic script routines or programs. If a login prompt asks to save or remember your username and/or password, always responds no. Immediately change any default passwords for any TTB information systems. If you think that a password has been compromised, change your password and immediately notify your supervisor. Do not install or use unauthorized hardware or software. Also do not exchange system components. All hardware and software must be documented, tested, authorized and approved for use by the Office of the Chief Information Officer in accordance with TTB's configuration management plan. Do not use privately owned hardware, software or media to process, access, or store TTB information without written approval of the Chief Information Officer. Neo.Treas.Gov access is an exception to this and its use is specifically authorized in the TTB remote access policy, including additional rules of behavior specific to that system. Privately owned equipment shall not be connected to TTB systems and the TTB network.

10. Personnel should take every precaution to physically protect portable media, including laptop computers. Some examples of physically protecting portable media include locking it in a safe, keeping it on your person, and securing laptops with laptop cable locks. The requirement to physically secure laptop computers exists everywhere: in your office, while traveling, in temporary lodging and yes, in your home. 11. Protect all TTB computer equipment from hazards such as liquids, food, smoke, etc. 12. Retrieve all hard copy printouts in a timely manner. If you cannot determine the originator or receiver of a printout, dispose of it in a waste container used specifically for sensitive data. 13. Protect any removable storage media (e.g., magnetic, optical, flash/thumb drives, etc.) from exposure to electrical currents, extreme temperatures, bending, fluids, smoke, etc. Ensure that all removable storage media is properly labeled and protected based on the sensitivity of the information contained. You are prohibited from storing sensitive data on removable media (USB hard drive, flash drive, CD, DVD) until an encryption solution is deployed for TTB. Once an encryption solution is deployed, all sensitive data on removable media must be encrypted.

Appendix VII

TTB IT Security Rules of Behavior
14. You must take every precaution to avoid storing sensitive, unencrypted data on any removable or portable media, including laptop hard drives. For those employees who are absolutely required to transport and access sensitive data to perform their mission function, the following applies: a. b. The first storage location of choice for sensitive data is the database application (don't extract the data in the first place), second choice is your personal network drive (the G drive). If you MUST have sensitive data on your laptop, the sensitive data must be encrypted. Interim detailed procedures to encrypt the data have been promulgated. Read these instructions carefully so that you can protect AND RETRIEVE your sensitive data. Again, you should carefully weigh the need to transport sensitive data against the risk involved.

15. Lock or log off from any workstation that you are using when you go to lunch, take a break, or anytime you leave the workstation. 16. Employees are permitted to use government office equipment, including IT resources for personal purposes on a limited basis, when such use involves minimal additional expense to the Government and does not overburden any of TTB's information resources. Please reference TTB O 7321.1 Personal Use of Government Office Equipment, Including Information Technology Resources, for additional clarification as needed. 17. Employees are prohibited from using the Internet to access pornography, hacker sites, or any other site that may be deemed inappropriate. If you have any question on what may be considered inappropriate, ask your supervisor BEFORE accessing the site. 18. Back up critical data and store it in a safe place. These backups should be performed regularly and the data/media should be protected in accordance with the sensitivity of the data contained in the backup. 19. Use TTB provided and properly configured equipment and software (e.g. TTB laptop/VPN or Neo.treas.gov) for remote access TTB information systems and data from home, hotels, customer sites, etc. Please reference TTB O 7320.1, Remote Access Policy for additional rules of behavior for remote access to TTB systems. 20. Observe all software licensing agreements. Do not violate Federal Copyright laws. If you have any questions about copyright or licensing, contact the Office of Chief Counsel BEFORE using the material in question. 21. Do not disclose or discuss any TTB-related information with unauthorized individuals. Depending on the nature of the information, unauthorized disclosure would not only constitute a violation of TTB policy and directive and could result in employee discipline but such a willful unauthorized disclosure could violate a number of different criminal statutes, including, for example, the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6103, and/or The Privacy Act, 5 USC 552a and result in prosecution, fines and jail time. 22. Employees are required to acknowledge these Rules of Behavior before they will be granted access privileges to any TTB information system. Thereafter, employees are required to re-acknowledge these rules on an annual basis; failure to do so will cause access privileges to be disabled. 23. Promptly report all security incidents, no matter how insignificant they may appear, to the TTB Information Security Office (ttb_infosec@ttb.gov; 202-927-0330) or Jackie Washington (Jackie.washington@ttb.gov; 202927-0327). These security incidents can include unauthorized disclosure of information, computer viruses, theft of equipment or data, deliberate alteration or destruction of data or equipment, etc. CONDUCT WHICH DOES NOT CONFORM TO THESE RULES MAY FORM THE BASIS FOR APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION. PENALTIES CAN RANGE FROM REPRIMAND FOR A MINOR INFRACTION TO REMOVAL FROM THE FEDERAL SERVICE OR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR THE MOST SERIOUS VIOLATIONS.

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

1. Introduction
1.1 PURPOSE
The Target Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a business-driven plan that describes the desired future state for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau's (TTB) strategy and performance, business, applications/services, technology, data, and security at the end of a three to five year planning horizon. It is the foundation for IT modernization, driving both investment in and implementation of systems and technologies that will transform TTB's business. The framework of the Target EA is further described in Section 1.4 below. The primary purpose of the Target EA is to effectively plan a course for achieving TTB's strategic vision and goals. It is one element in a broader set of inter-related planning activities that collectively enable TTB managers and staff to define a vision, develop strategies and plans for achieving the vision, make resource decisions, implement strategies, and evaluate performance. By defining the desired future state from several distinct perspectives (e.g. business, data, etc.), the Target EA also provides stakeholders with a "line of sight" into the complex relationships that exist among these different perspectives. TTB has 18 FISMA-reported custom application systems, executes overlapping business and information management processes, and relies on various technologies that are expensive to maintain. To reduce cost and streamline operations, TTB is moving toward a service-oriented and component-based approach to architecture. This approach, consistent with government and industry best practice, enables TTB to "build once, use often." In other words, by separating out the functionality or capabilities of a business process or application into discrete pieces, components can be shared and reused across the enterprise. As a result of this approach, the TTB Target EA will: Improve Program Performance ­ The overarching benefit of the Target EA is that it provides opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of TTB's programs. It ensures that business functions support strategic goals and priorities, data is optimized in support of the business, and applications and technology solutions are driven by business needs. It also allows TTB to more readily share services across organizational and functional lines. Simplify Investment Decisions ­ The Target EA provides a line of sight from strategy to business function to technology, allowing decision-makers to be able to more quickly assess the relative value of initiatives, and to identify duplicative or misaligned initiatives. Reduce IT Diversity and Complexity ­ The Target EA simplifies TTB's IT environment by promoting standards and the sharing and reuse of common technologies. Improve Interoperability - The Target EA establishes enterprise-wide standards that promote platform and vendor independence, enabling greater interoperability across disparate applications, both internal and external. Improve Utilization of Resources ­ The Target EA reduces system development and operation and maintenance costs by eliminating duplicative investments, promoting sharing of common services, and establishing Department-wide standards. Accelerate System Implementation ­ The Target EA equips the bureau's system developers and architects with a pallet of component-based services from which to choose that provide well defined functionality, thus maximizing reuse and portability of previously developed processes, components, code, etc.

U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

The purpose of the TTB EA program is to increase the quality and speed of the Office of Chief Information Officer's (OCIO's) response to the bureau's mission needs. The EA is a comprehensive set of interrelated models that represent the bureau's mission, goals, operations and information infrastructure. The EA is a strategic information asset base consisting of the Business, Performance, Applications/Services, Data, Technology, and Security Layers necessary to deliver programs and operate the bureau. The EA program is integrated with TTB's strategic planning, configuration management, capital planning, and portfolio management processes. By providing these processes with detailed and comprehensive information on how the bureau's mission, operations and information infrastructure are inter-related and interdependent, the EA program ensures that enterprise-wide and OCIO initiatives are executed in the most effective manner possible. There is also a compliance function to TTB's EA program activities. Among the legislative and regulatory drivers TTB is responding to with its EA program are the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ The Clinger-Cohen Act, 1996 (Pub. L. 104-106, Division E) Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) OMB Circular A-130, Revised, (Transmittal Memorandum No. 4), 2003 Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Reference Models/OMB's EA Assessment Framework

TTB recognizes that, while data and information are key components of an architecture, standards for hardware and software alone do not create the most efficient organization. EA is a blueprint developed and maintained to explain and guide how IT and information management elements will work together to effectively accomplish the mission, goals, and objectives of the organization. The TTB EA is a cohesive information structure defined by (1) the bureau's mission and supporting business activities, (2) the data and information integral to bureau operations, (3) the technologies deployed to support business operations, and (4) the processes necessary for transitioning to or implementing new technologies in response to changing business needs. Thus, the value of the TTB EA lies in the relationships, interactions, and dependencies inherent to the business operations of TTB.

1.2 SCOPE
4B

The TTB EA program integrates all of its component divisions into a single bureau EA. The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) facilitates understanding and use of the TTB EA. The offices and divisions listed below are each represented in the organizational charts and functional descriptions in the TTB Baseline Enterprise Architecture. TTB Offices and Divisions: ˇ EXECUTIVE OFFICES ˇ Office of the Administrator and Deputy Administrator ˇ State Liaison CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER ˇ Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) ˇ Information Technology Security Office ˇ TTB HelpDesk CHIEF OF STAFF ˇ Office of the Chief of Staff (OCS) ˇ Security Officer

1.3 INTENDED AUDIENCE
5B

The Target EA is applicable to all divisions and offices within TTB, representing the current state of the bureau's business, performance, applications/services, data, technology, and security. ˇ Program and Staff Office Business and IT Managers ­ TTB business and IT executives should understand and support the TTB EA mission, goals and objectives, in conjunction with acknowledging the current state of TTB's EA. Program/Project Managers ­ Program and project managers that are responsible for IT initiatives should be in agreement that the current state of TTB initiatives is accurately depicted. Office of the Chief Information Officer ­ All OCIO staff should be familiar with the Target EA. As members of the office with primary responsibility for planning and deploying systems and technology in support of the bureau's business, the OCIO staff needs to understand the current state of the bureau and the specific services and technologies that are employed. TTB Architecture Working Group/Change Control Board (AWG/CCB) ­ The AWG/CCB is chartered to review and approve the technical specifications of newly proposed IT initiatives and approve technical feasibility.

The Department of the Treasury ­ The Department must ensure that TTB's enterprise architecture is consistent with department-wide service component, technology, and data standards. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ­ TTB will submit its most current EA document to OMB. OMB will use it as a benchmark to verify the progress that TTB has made in transitioning from the Baseline EA to the Target EA. Peer Agencies ­ TTB collaborates with other federal agencies in the implementation of its programs. The Target EA will help these partnering entities understand TTB's approach to its business and supporting technology.

1.4 BACKGROUND
The EA program was developed and is currently maintained within the OCIO. In recent years the EA program has matured into a process that aids in strategic planning, configuration management, capital planning, and portfolio management. TTB's current EA baseline evolved from a Technical Architecture, which originated at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). Using the preexisting Technical Architecture and the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) standard, the Target EA was developed. The data contained in TTB's EA originates in the OCIO, but when appropriate, must be reviewed and approved by TTB Stakeholders. Data was collected through interviews conducted between members of the TTB IT Governance Team and TTB Stakeholders and through the review of existing documentation.

1.5 EA FRAMEWORK

The TTB EA framework is based on the FEA, but has been slightly modified to meet TTB's requirements. The TTB EA framework selection is also consistent with the Department of the Treasury's EA framework, including use of the reference models released by OMB.
Figure 1 ­ Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA) Reference Models

To facilitate efforts to transform the federal government to one that is citizen-centered, results-oriented, and market-based, the OMB has instituted the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) as a business-based framework for government-wide improvement. The FEAF has been constructed through the collection of interrelated "reference models" depicted above, designed to facilitate cross-agency analysis and the identification of duplicative investments, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration within and across federal agencies. Each layer of the EA continues to evolve around an associated OMB reference model. The TTB EA is composed of the following layers, depicted in Figure 2 below.

The Business Layer describes the business processes of TTB from an enterprise-wide perspective. The Performance Layer describes the performance management structure TTB utilizes in assessing and correcting business process performance challenges. The Applications/Services Layer defines the types of systems and applications required to manage the data and support the business processes. The Data Layer identifies the data and information needed to support the business. The Technology Layer defines the technological infrastructure (hardware, software, and communications network technologies) that supports the systems and applications identified in the applications/services layer. Security defines the processes and standard technologies used to secure the TTB IT Infrastructure and ensure compliance with IT security mandates. Security plays an integral role in all layers of the EA.

ˇ

The linkages and relationships within the various layers of the architecture are as important as the layerspecific information contained in the TTB EA. The linkages between the layers provide insight into the effect of a change in one element of the architecture on other elements in other layers of the EA. By analyzing these linkages, TTB can analyze the potential impact of any strategic, operational or infrastructure initiative. Independent of initiative-related analysis, the EA also supports the discovery of redundancies, overlapping functionality, performance bottlenecks and potential security issues, any of which may be analyzed and corrected, based on information contained within the EA.

1.6 EA MISSION AND GOALS
8B

Key elements for the explicit definition and effective implementation of the TTB EA program include EA-specific mission and goals that are in alignment with bureau strategic goals and objectives.

1.6.1 EA Mission
20B

Guided by the strategic objectives of TTB, the EA is consistent with the legal requirements of the Clinger-Cohen Act and OMB Circular A-130. The TTB EA mission statement is as follows: The mission of TTB's Enterprise Architecture (EA) is to develop and implement an evolving, performance-based architecture that, aligned with the overall TTB mission and strategic

1.7 TTB GOALS
Since the earliest days of this country, revenue from alcohol and tobacco products has helped sustain the U.S. economy and fund the federal government. Public safety and revenue protection are the main objectives of TTB, and are the focus of its employees on a daily basis. The bureau is dedicated to protecting the public and collecting all the revenue legally due from the commodities it regulates. The more TTB strives to clearly define its goals within the mission, the more effectively it will be able to meet its goals.

1.7.1 TTB Organizational Structure
2B

On November 25, 2002 President George W. Bush signed into law the Homeland Security Act of 2002. One provision of this act divided the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) into agencies ­ ATF which moved to the Department of Justice, and TTB, which remains in the Department of the Treasury. The two agencies separated on January 24, 2003. TTB will administer, enforce, and implement the federal laws and regulations related to the production and taxation of alcohol and tobacco products, as well as the statutes that impose Federal excise tax on firearms and ammunition. The major functions of TTB include:

11

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

Collecting alcohol, tobacco, firearms and ammunition excise taxes and classifying alcohol and tobacco products for excise tax purposes; Investigating applications, and issuing permits, for the operation of distilleries, wineries, breweries, and tobacco manufacturers, importers and exporters; Regulating the operations of various industrial users of distilled spirits, including manufacturers of non-beverage products, tax-free and denatured alcohols; Regulating the production, packaging, bottling, labeling and storage of alcohol and tobacco products; Ensuring that labeling and advertising of alcohol beverages provide adequate information to the consumer concerning the identity and quality of the product; Preventing misleading labeling or advertising of alcohol beverages; Regulating the marketing and promotional practices concerning the sale of alcohol beverages by producers and wholesalers. This is done primarily through the investigation of allegations of illegal trade practices; and Enforcing provisions of the Alcohol Beverage Labeling Act which mandates that a government warning statement appear on all alcohol beverages for sale and distribution in the United States.

ˇ

TTB is organized into Headquarters Operations and Field Operations, with Headquarters maintained in Washington, DC. Field offices are located in the states of Washington, California, Texas, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Puerto Rico. While this new agency is much smaller in size than its predecessor, its focus on only revenue collection and consumer protection will allow its personnel to provide specialized attention and service to its customers. The organizational structure of TTB is shown below in Figure 3 ­ TTB Organizational Chart.

1.8.2 Analysis and Decomposition
27B

Business Drivers
41B

Several statutory authorities and responsibilities lie with the TTB. These mission drivers include the Homeland Security (HLS) Act, Internal Revenue Code (IRC), Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act, Alcohol Beverage Labeling Act, and the Webb-Kenyon Act. Each of these regulations is detailed in the following sections. Homeland Security Act
42B

The HLS Act renders functions of the ATF into two new organizations. This HLS Act creates TTB within the Department of Treasury and moves certain law enforcement functions of ATF to the Department of Justice. Under the HLS Act, TTB is responsible for administration and enforcement of: ˇ Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 USC (IRC); ­ Chapter 51 (Distilled Spirits, Wine and Beer) ­ Chapter 52 (Tobacco Products and Cigarette Papers and Tubes) ­ Sections 4181-4182 (Firearms and Ammunition Excise Taxes) Federal Alcohol Administration Act, 27 USC Chapter 8 (FAA Act) Alcohol Beverage Labeling Act of 1988 (Health Warning Statement) Webb-Kenyon Act, 27 USC Section 122.

ˇ ˇ ˇ

The HLS Act transfers enforcement of the National Firearms Act, 26 USC Chapter 53, to the Attorney General, who must coordinate this tax enforcement with the Secretary of the Treasury. Internal Revenue Code
43B

The IRC of 1986, as amended includes tax laws related to income, payroll, and excise taxes for the United States. The IRC includes most federal tax statutes. Chapters 51 and 52 provide for excise taxation and authorize operations of alcohol and tobacco producers and related industries. These provisions include: ˇ ˇ ˇ Classification of alcohol and tobacco products for excise tax purposes; Permits methods of operation for distilleries, wineries, breweries, industrial alcohol producers and users, and tobacco manufacturers importers and exporters; Regulation of the operations of distilleries, wineries, brewers, and of various industrial users of distilled spirits, including manufacturers of nonbeverage products, tax-free, and denatured alcohols; Imposition of various occupational taxes; Regulation of the production, packaging, bottling, labeling and storage requirements related to these commodities; Issue permits and regulate operations for tobacco importers, tobacco manufacturing premises and export warehouses; IRC sections 4181 and 4182 provide for excise taxes for firearms and ammunition.

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ

18

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

Federal Alcohol Administration Act
4B

The FAA Act provides for regulation of those engaged in the alcohol beverage industry, and for protection of consumers. ˇ To ensure the integrity of the industry, the FAA Act includes provisions to: ­ Require a permit for those who engage in the business as a producer, importer, or wholesaler of alcohol beverages; ­ Issue, suspend, and revoke permits; ­ Ensure the integrity of the industry by preventing persons who are not likely to operate in accordance with the law from entering the trade; ­ Protect the revenue and consumers by ensuring the integrity of the industry members. To protect consumers, FAA Act includes provisions to: ­ Ensure that labeling and advertising of alcohol beverages provide adequate information to the consumer concerning the identity and quality of the product; ­ Require that alcohol beverage bottlers and importers to obtain a certificate of label approval (COLA) or an exemption certificate before the product may be bottled, imported, sold or distributed in the United States; ­ Prevent misleading labeling or advertising that may result in potential for consumer deception regarding the product. The FAA Act includes provisions to preclude unfair trade practices. These provisions: ­ Regulate the marketing promotional practices concerning the sale of alcohol beverages; and ­ Regulate practices such as exclusive outlets, tied house arrangements, commercial bribery, and consignment sales.

ˇ

ˇ

The Alcohol Beverage Labeling Act of 1988
45B

The Alcohol Beverage Labeling Act of 1988 mandates that a government health warning statement appear on all alcohol beverages for sale or distribution in the United States. The Webb-Kenyon Act
46B

The Webb-Kenyon Act prohibits the shipment of alcohol beverages into a state in violation of the receiving state's laws. This statute provides additional authority to enhance enforcement of FAA Act requirements. TTB E-Government Support Solutions
47B

A major driver of the target architecture is the President's Management Agenda/E-Government initiative. The primary goal of E-Government is to improve the ability of government agencies to share information. This involves shifting delivery of information resources online, enabling more efficient intra-government exchanges as well as providing more effective interactions between government agencies and their constituents. Part of the target Applications/Services environment takes into account the integration of externally-facing custom applications with the e-Authentication federal e-Gov initiative. This will be part of the shared security service included as part of the target architecture.

1.8.3 Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
28B

Service orientation is an approach to designing software systems. A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architecture of systems consisting of modular software components with standardized component-

19

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

access and usage interfaces that are independent of any specific platform or implementation technology. More importantly, a SOA enables software components to become standard services that can be invoked on demand, rather than repeatedly designed and programmed. In SOA, a "service" is typically a group of software components that together carry out a high-level function or business process, such as placing an order or making a credit approval on a purchase. At its most basic, a SOA is simply a collection of standardized services on a network that communicate with one another in the context of a business process. This approach dramatically eases integration in heterogeneous environments and provides a major enhancement in agility. All services share some common characteristics: ˇ Services have interfaces that are platform or implementation-technology independent. Services are exposed using standards-based, identical interfaces that make them easy to use and reuse, and guarantee dynamic interoperability. Services are loosely coupled. Services can be created based on anticipated demand; creation of services is not dependent on a specific need or requirement. In addition, changes made to the service implementation will have no ripple effect on the users or consumers of that service. Services are coarse grained. Services focus on high-level business processes using standard interfaces, and thus mask the underlying technical and operational complexities of how a service is implemented. Services are modular. A service represents a discrete unit of business, application or system functionality. Multiple services can be combined to enable organizations to implement more efficient business functions. This modular approach gives organizations great flexibility in system design. By reassembling services into a new configuration, a business can create a new business service to support a different business objective.

ˇ

ˇ

ˇ

As a strategy for creating a flexible and agile technical architecture, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has gained considerable momentum in recent years, largely due to the advent of standards-based Web services. There are some powerful business drivers for implementing SOA today: ˇ IT Agility and Lower Costs SOA makes IT more responsive to changing business demands and requirements. Reconfiguring business services is simple, fast and low-cost. ˇ Maximizing Enterprise Application Investments SOA is not a rip-and-replace strategy--they wrap and reuse business functions from existing enterprise applications and make them available to a significantly broader audience without change. SOA encourages reuse and avoids unnecessary duplication and reinvention. ˇ Facilitating New Applications Web service-based SOA is smooth the development and management of composite applications. Composite applications improve business performance by pulling together information from multiple applications without complicated and time-consuming IT processes. ˇ Standards--Foundation for the Future SOA uses standards-based components and interfaces provide ubiquitous interoperability with all applications and services, making IT more flexible and dramatically simplifying integration.

20

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

The evolution to a SOA requires new thinking about service oriented application design, the creation and reuse of business services that leverage existing enterprise applications, the lifecycle management of business services, and the IT deployment roadmap for new SOA infrastructure. SOA provides the design approach for a new generation of modular, standardized business services. The business service lifecycle provides both the control and a logical way to map business and technology requirements into a SOA model. Figure 6 ­ Service-Oriented Architecture illustrates the basic concept of a SOA.
Figure 6 ­ Service-Oriented Architecture

TTB will work with Treasury and other agencies, where possible, to identify those service components, government-wide or at another agency, that may be needed to support TTB business missions prior to beginning independent development and/or integration efforts to support TTB's requirements.

1.9 PLANS FOR EVOLVING THE TTB ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE
The TTB EA team and IT Governance team has worked in collaboration with representatives from the Applications, Data, IT Security, and Infrastructure groups within the OCIO to develop the Target Architecture and Transition Strategy. The direction of the Target EA is driven by several factors: the requirement of TTB to be in compliance with federal mandates, the needs of the bureau, technology modernization, and IT asset consolidation ­ where possible. A gap analysis exercise was performed following the completion of the Target Architecture. From the Gap Analysis, the TTB EA team has developed a five year Transition Strategy that will transform TTB from its current Baseline EA to the Target EA, based upon defined transition programs. Project managers from TTB Applications, Data, Infrastructure, and Security groups will use the Target Architecture and Transition Strategy to develop the necessary detailed project plans and work breakdown structures to move to the Target Architecture. In an effort to operationalize the TTB EA and begin the transition from the baseline to the target architecture, the EA, CPIC and Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC) processes at TTB will need to be integrated to support the transition. The Target Architecture and Transition Strategy will be used during the CPIC process to secure funds for the necessary transition projects, and the SDLC will be used as the process for transition project execution. Figure 7 illustrates the relationship among the EA, CPIC and SDLC processes at TTB. Further guidance and documentation on the use of the TTB EA Artifacts in conjunction with other TTB processes will be released as subsequent guidance around the TTB EA efforts. This will include the governance aspects of the EA and CPIC processes at TTB.

21

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

Figure 7 ­ EA, CPIC, SDLC Process Integration

Effective use of TTB's processes together will help to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Reduce performance gaps in the overall portfolio by retiring obsolete systems; Review and approve/reject IT proposals and investments; Support the development of reusable application components; Assist the bureau in maturing its IT investment management; Address statutory and regulatory requirements; and Assist the bureau in meeting its targeted business results through an accountability framework

The incorporation of EA into the bureau's decision-making processes is key to ensuring the efficiency of all management processes. This coordination allows for a straight "line of sight" from budget decisionmaking to specific IT investments thereby demonstrating how they contribute to improved program performance. The integration of CPIC and EA provides more insightful business intelligence to TTB management and will be facilitated through the coordination of management processes. Representatives from the TTB OCIO will continue to: ˇ ˇ ˇ Ensure proper integration between requested IT projects and submitted Exhibit 300s and 53s; Review proposed IT investments in the budget to ensure proper authorization to proceed had been received through the Select Process; Identify and consider out year funding implications; and

22

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

ˇ

Ensure alignment with the TTB Enterprise Architecture

In addition, TTB will work with Treasury to achieve a common vision of solution architecture where possible, with a specific focus on areas where TTB and Treasury can both make use of investments and IT assets. These areas may include building common solutions in support of TTB transition program efforts as well as Treasury-wide enterprise initiatives. These efforts include some of the target services that TTB will be developing and integrating across its infrastructure and custom applications including, but not limited to, Shared Reporting, Security Management and Imaging. TTB will work with Treasury to ensure that there is a strategic alignment between TTB's target and transition-related efforts and Treasuryrelated efforts. EA Integration with the CPIC Process
48B

TTB has implemented an IT investment initiative selection process that ensures strategic integration of EA with CPIC, standardization of initiative assessment/prioritization, and more centralized portfolio management analyses and support. The Select phase has expanded the evaluation criteria to better incorporate EA as a significant, decision-making component of this process. For more details on TTB's EA integration with the CPIC Process, refer to the TTB CPIC Program Guide. In the past, the investment selection process has primarily focused on a business value assessment. Additionally, the degree to which an investment supports the bureau's goals and objectives is assessed. The development and implementation of a more integrated approach will ensure all investments align to the bureau's overall goals and objectives, as well as a more robust EA component. The integration of EA and IT Strategic Planning with CPIC processes will yield: ˇ ˇ Rapid identification of appropriate IT investment goals Maturation of the bureau's IT investment management ˇ Access to integrated strategic, budget and IT information that will provide a better "line of sight" and approach for decisions that affect the direction of the bureau Development of a more standardized system of prioritization to support the decision-making process Reduced performance gaps in the overall portfolio by retiring obsolete systems and identifying duplicative technology

ˇ ˇ

The incorporation of EA into the bureau's decision-making processes is key to ensuring the efficiency of all management processes. This coordination allows for a straight line from budget decision-making to specific IT investments, thereby demonstrating how they contribute to improved program performance. The integration of CPIC and EA provides more insightful business intelligence to TTB management.

1.10 PRINCIPLES
12B

1.10.1 Introduction
29B

The development and implementation of architecture is an ongoing and iterative cycle. With each iteration, TTB's architecture matures and progresses. However, while the detailed elements defined within individual layers of the architecture (e.g. a business process, application or technical standard) may change with relative frequency the bureau has established a more stable vision and approach for the development and implementation of the EA. In this way, the many stakeholders involved in EA activities at both the bureau and division levels share a common direction and purpose in their efforts.

1.10.2 Principles Summary
30B

23

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

TTB has adopted a set of architecture principles to ensure that EA supports TTB's business and technology requirements. The principles help to establish a common vision to ensure that strategic objectives are not compromised by tactical decision-making. The following principles guide the development and implementation of the TTB EA: 1. TTB maintains a single bureau-wide EA with a federated approach to developing, maintaining and implementing the architecture. 2. TTB's mission and business drive the design of the EA. 3. Architectural decision-making is results-oriented and measurable. 4. The EA ensures that information management decisions are made to provide maximum benefit to TTB and the public at a minimum cost to the organization. 5. The EA leverages and aligns with government-wide architectures and solutions wherever practical. 6. The EA promotes sharing, re-use, and common solutions. 7. The EA reduces complexity through the use of enterprise standards. 8. Information and data are managed as enterprise assets. 9. Security and privacy are integrated into all architectural layers. 10. The EA will be planned and managed through a formal governance process. These principles have broad implications for not only for members of the TTB Governance Team, but also for business and IT decision-makers, project managers, initiative owners, systems staff and contractors, and others.
Principles Detail

Table 2 below summarizes not only the implications for each of the principles, but also the rationale for their selection. As a general rule, these principles have a broad base of support across government and industry.

Implications TTB maintains a single bureau-wide EA with a federated approach to developing, maintaining and implementing the architecture ˇ Strategic planning, resource allocation and IT investments are optimized at the bureau level. ˇ TTB must execute a collaborative EA governance model that leverages existing resources, culture, and experience in a teamoriented approach designed to develop, maintain, implement and enforce the architecture. ˇ TTB respects unique program-specific mandates, roles, and functions. ˇ Data, applications, and infrastructure are assets and resources of the entire enterprise. ˇ Individual TTB offices or programs may have to concede their architectural based decisions for the greater good of the entire enterprise. ˇ All TTB organizations and lines of business "own" EA. All TTB organizations and lines of business have a stake in the definition and implementation of EA.

ˇ TTB's EA identifies economies of scale, streamlines interactions and communication with stakeholders and reduces stovepipes and unnecessary duplication. ˇ TTB is mandated by the ClingerCohen Act and OMB Circular A-130 to develop and enforce a single EA. ˇ TTB's Federated approach to EA ensures centralized decision-making for architectural decisions with bureau-wide impact, while allowing for autonomy in architectural decision-making at the business line and office level where appropriate.

Rationale ˇ Integration of business and IT planning and strategy ensures that IT effectively enables and supports TTB's mission.

Implications ˇ TTB's EA supports the bureau's mission, vision and strategy by streamlining business processes and information flows and effectively applying enabling technologies. ˇ Information management and architecture decisions are an equally shared responsibility of all business units within TTB, and are made to ensure that services help accomplish business objectives. ˇ TTB's business and IT leaders must engage in strategy development and planning together. ˇ Program staff must actively participate in the definition and implementation of TTB's EA. ˇ All TTB organizations must participate in the development of systems and services to ensure that providers and customers have a clear understanding of services to be provided, and to guarantee that TTB complies with external laws and external and internal policies and regulations. ˇ Major new or replacement information system investments will be approved only after work processes have been examined for modernization or reengineering opportunities. ˇ New systems will be designed to be flexible enough to evolve with changing business, functional, and technological requirements.

2. TTB's mission and business drive the design of the EA.

3. Architectural decision-making is results-oriented and measurable. ˇ TTB's EA is a planning framework and tool for defining and implementing enabling technologies to support business and information needs. It is only effective if it produces demonstrable results that are valued by the enterprise. ˇ Selection of technologies is founded on effective and efficient use of information in support of TTB's business. ˇ Metrics are developed and used to assess improvements obtained from EA decisions.

4. The EA ensures that information management decisions are made to provide maximum benefit to TTB and the public at a minimum cost to the organization. ˇ TTB's EA fulfills business and information requirements while reducing duplicative investments. ˇ Compliance with EA is a prerequisite for IT investment. ˇ All TTB divisions have a stake in defining EA as it affects their funding for IT investments. ˇ Governance mechanisms are required to ensure investments conform to the architecture. Sound business justification is required for exceptions and/or waivers. ˇ Data, systems, and technology are designed and used to optimize that value of the services provided and should promote and enhance quality, effectiveness, efficiency, and/or functionality for the internal and external customer of TTB. 5. The EA leverages and aligns with government-wide architectures and solutions wherever practical. ˇ Government-wide solutions, such as the Presidential E-Gov and LOB initiatives, provide cost savings for the Federal government. ˇ Identified opportunities to integrate with other levels of government can yield cost savings and streamline interactions with TTB business partners. ˇ TTB's EA and CPIC processes ensure investments are not duplicative of E-Gov and LOB initiatives. ˇ TTB's EA leverages government-wide services and solutions when it makes practical business sense to do so. ˇ TTB's segment architectures and individual initiatives explore opportunities to better integrate solutions with TTB's business partners.

26

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

Rationale ˇ Sharing, reuse and common solutions provide economies of scale for the bureau and reduce duplication. ˇ Reusable components and common solutions provide opportunities to reduce IT development costs and development time.

Implications ˇ TTB's EA governance must emphasize cooperative strategies for satisfying common requirements across the bureau that eliminate unnecessary duplication and incompatibility of systems, data, and business processes. ˇ Reuse must be a design consideration for all EA components. ˇ Common solutions can address any architectural layer. ˇ Investment, design and implementation decisions favor reusable components and common solutions. ˇ Requirements reflect the needs of all affected business elements and build in flexibility to address unique business requirements.

6. The EA promotes sharing, re-use, and common solutions

7. The EA reduces complexity through the use of enterprise standards ˇ Standardization reduces costs and time for meeting current and future business requirements. ˇ Enterprise standards provide an important mechanism for streamlining the technology landscape, ensuring the interoperability of systems and improving the stability of the environment. ˇ Data, applications, and technology are implemented within an architectural framework that is sound, consistent in use, and flexible to accommodate the diverse business of TTB. ˇ EA governance ensures that technical standards are approved, enforced, and refreshed as necessary. Governance mechanisms allow for exceptions and/or waivers in cases where there is a sound business justification. ˇ Emerging standards change required IT skill sets and generate requirements for staff training. ˇ The standards contained in this framework are based on formal or de facto industry standards and or the decisions made within TTB and the government as a whole to ensure quality and safety of technology and data. 8. Information and data are managed as enterprise assets. ˇ Information leveraged across the value chain improves performance, supports decision-making and enables accurate reporting. ˇ Data will be defined and the quality, integrity, and sharing of the data is managed to ensure an appropriate balance between accessibility and security. ˇ Enterprise-wide access to data, based on users' business needs for and rights to that information, is the rule rather than the exception. Program areas provide the necessary data and information to the bureau as requested and needed taking into consideration restrictions due to data confidentiality, privacy, or "need to know" concerns. ˇ Data standardization is critical for all information and data types that are common to or shared across more than one TTB division or program. ˇ Data stewards are assigned for all enterprise data. Stewards have the authority and means to manage the data for which they are accountable. ˇ Data are captured once. ˇ The way information is accessed and displayed is sufficiently adaptable to meet the needs of a wide range of enterprise users with multiple access methods.

27

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

Rationale ˇ TTB safeguards confidential information to enhance public trust. Information and data must be protected from unauthorized access, use and disclosure. ˇ TTB must comply with established security requirements, such as the Privacy Act of 1974, FISMA, and OMB A-130 Security of Federal Automated Information Resources (App.III). ˇ Considering security implications at the outset improves cost management and reduces risk.

Implications ˇ Security planning and management is integrated with all aspects of business and IT planning and governance, including: business, IT and E-Gov strategic planning; CPIC and budget; data management; and, system development, engineering and integration. ˇ Data and information are clearly categorized based on security, privacy and sensitivity considerations, and rules are clearly defined and universally understood by data users. ˇ Audit and monitoring mechanisms are used to secure information resources. ˇ Public access systems are isolated from mission critical resources.

9. Security and privacy are integrated into all architectural layers.

10. The EA will be planned, developed and managed through a formal governance process. ˇ Formalized governance for EA ensures that it is developed, implemented, and managed consistently throughout the bureau. ˇ EA governance will include an Enterprise-level architecture review process, at the Architecture Working Group (AWG) and Enterprise Change Control Board (E-CCB) levels.

2. Target EA
1B

2.1 INTRODUCTION
13B

The target architecture for TTB, commonly referred to as the "To-Be" architecture, serves as the set of work products that portray the future or desired state of the enterprise. These are captured in the entire bureau's organizational strategic thinking and plans. The primary drivers of enterprise-wide change, that helped define the target EA, is based upon, but not limited to, the following factors: technology modernization, internal/external IT asset sharing, reuse and consolidation, as well as the move towards a service-oriented architecture. The target architecture is broken out into six different layers that affect the TTB enterprise: Business, Performance, Applications/Services, Data, Technology and Security. Each layer is described in detail, with a description of the desired state, as well as the framework for how each layer is captured, classified and described. The target architecture builds on development and implementation guidance outlined by TTB's EA Principles. It leverages the bureau's strategic business, IT goals and objectives, which drive the development of the Target EA to provide a conceptual overview of the desired architectural state. The primary purpose of the Target EA is to effectively define the desired state for helping achieve TTB's strategic goals. It is one element in a broader set of inter-related planning activities (Strategic Planning, IT Capital Planning, Transition Planning, Software Management, etc.) that collectively enable management and staff to define a vision, develop strategies and plans for achieving the vision, make resource decisions, implement strategies, and evaluate performance. The listing of target TTB mission systems contains the initiatives that comprise custom applications, imaging applications, web sites and TTB specialized applications. These initiatives are the foundation for an application inventory. This application inventory has and will continue to provide a basis for further analysis to identify (1) existing applications whose functionality and technical structure enable them to meet inter-program or enterprise requirements; (2) applications with duplicative functionality; and (3) applications that are candidates for replacement or conversion to newer technology. TTB manages three main mission support systems: ˇ ˇ ˇ Tax Collection and Field Operations Major Applications (MA) System Regulatory Major Applications (MA) System Network Infrastructure General Support System (GSS)
16H

The target systems and sub-systems inventory, detailed in Table 3 ­ TTB Target Systems Inventory below, represents the applications, or sub-system set of applications that will support the target architecture. These systems support and relate to all areas of the TTB architecture, and are discussed in detail within the area of the architecture that the application or sub-system supports. The primary focus of change for the target architecture involves the custom applications. For more information on these please refer to the TTB EA Transition Plan.

2.2 BUSINESS LAYER
The Business Layer provides a functional view of the business and identifies the organization, locations, stakeholder, supporting lines of business, business functions, and sub-functions core to accomplishing the bureau's mission and strategic goals. The Business Layer provides the top-down foundation for the rest of the target architecture and does not reflect a major departure from the way TTB currently conducts its business. This is attributed to the fact that the bureau's mission (Protect the Public, Collect Revenue) has proven to be relatively stable over time. The Applications/Services Layer will articulate the functional and information processing capabilities needed to support TTB's business. The Business Layer is defined through the Business Reference Model (BRM). The purpose of the BRM is to assist in the standardization of the terminology used to describe TTB's business. The BRM serves as a framework in which to evaluate the bureau's business, and the relationship between the business and other layers of the architecture. TTB Business Stakeholders Stakeholder identification and details of stakeholder interaction can assist TTB in better facilitating business relationships with the bureau. TTB has established Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with other federal agencies. Bureau personnel also work with other federal and state agencies in the regulation of the alcohol and tobacco industries. Additionally, TTB interacts regularly with other external business partners. Figure 8 ­ TTB Stakeholders below categorizes the primary stakeholders with which TTB maintains business relationships both internal and external to the federal government. Furthermore, Figure 8 ­ TTB Stakeholders details the information flows between TTB and its stakeholders.

2.2.1 Business Environment
31B

The target business environment will be indirectly affected by the changes made to the target Applications/Services, Data, Technology and Security Layers. For example, the use of PDAs by users to access resources and applications, in support of TTB business, will result in a change to the way in which business is conducted.

2.2.2 TTB Business Reference Model (BRM)
32B

The Business Reference Model (BRM) provides an organized, hierarchical construct for describing the day-to-day business operations of TTB. This model presents the business using a functionally driven

33

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

approach. The BRM is the first layer of the TTB EA and it is the main viewpoint for the analysis of applications/services, data, and technology. The identification of Business Areas, Line of Business (LoBs), and Sub-functions is based largely on the language and decompositions outlined within the FEA BRM. Use of this language provides a common vocabulary for communicating with other federal agencies and OMB when attempting to identify opportunities for multi-agency or federal government-wide solutions. All definitions associated with this common vocabulary can be found at http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/egov/a-1-fea.html. Not all FEA LoBs and Sub-functions are identified in the business layer. The FEA LoBs and Subfunctions not performed by TTB are excluded from the bureau's BRM. TTB's BRM is described below in Figure 9 ­ BRM. The model is comprised of 25 LoBs. Some of the functions identified directly carry out TTB's mission, whereas others support the mission indirectly through management and administration of resources. Seven of the TTB LoBs are located within the Services for Citizens Business Area, and describe the purpose of the bureau in functional terms. Five supporting Mode of Delivery LoBs exist to support the Services for Citizens Business Area. The remaining 13 LoBs describe the internal support functions conducted by TTB to effectively deliver services to citizens.

2.3 PERFORMANCE LAYER
The Performance Layer will be used to measure effective changes associated with the target architecture and associated transition plans. This measurement will make use of the IT Strategic Plan, with specific objectives for achieving the goals and associated performance measures. EA Performance Measures TTB is committed to an effective and evolving EA program. To that end, the performance measures depicted in Figure 11 ­ EA Performance Measures have been formulated to evaluate that the TTB EA is in accordance with the EA mission and goals.

2.3.1 TTB Performance Reference Model (PRM)
The PRM is a standardized framework to measure the performance of IT investments and their contribution to program performance. The PRM has three main purposes: 1. Help produce enhanced performance information to improve strategic and daily decision-making; 2. Improve the alignment -- and better articulate the contribution of -- inputs to outputs and outcomes, thereby creating a clear "line of sight" to desired results; and 3. Identify performance improvement opportunities that span traditional organizational structures and boundaries Figure 13 ­ TTB PRM Framework illustrates the PRM Framework. New and updated performance measures will be added to the PRM, as necessary, in subsequent versions of the model, and as execution of the transition programs begin to take place.

2.4 APPLICATIONS/SERVICES LAYER
The Target Applications/Services architecture describes the desired state of how applications and services will support TTB's business mission as well as its business processes. TTB has adopted a serviceoriented, component-based approach to architecture, whereby it will "build once, use often." In other words, separating the functionalities and capabilities of applications into the different services that they perform will promote the sharing and reuse of those capabilities across the enterprise, where possible. A Service Component Reference Model (SRM) describes capabilities and functionalities that make up TTB applications. The SRM consists of a 3-tiered hierarchy (service domains, service types, and components) that describes the information processing capabilities needed to support the bureau's business (i.e. the ability to capture, store, access, and manipulate business data and information).

2.4.1 Applications/Services Environment
The target Applications/Services environment is based upon an analysis of the baseline Applications/ Services architecture and environment. This has resulted in a "blueprint" for technology modernization, application consolidation, and the development and use of shared services ­ including potential Federal and Treasury-wide solutions.

38

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

All software used by the bureau is captured in the Authorized Software List (ASWL). The ASWL is a compilation of the applications, patches, and drivers installed on the TTB Network intended to support business operations. The applications are grouped into separate categories including, but not limited to, Operating Systems, Major Applications, among others. For a complete listing of the authorized software list, and associated categories, please refer to the current TTB ASWL. To support the move towards the desired application architecture, TTB will engage in modernization and consolidation of its existing custom applications to comply with the target technology architecture, performing consolidation and the sharing of services where possible. A service-oriented architecture and the use of shared services will take place over time, as candidate shared services are recommended. These shared services will be built upon a consistent interface for common application capabilities, without requiring significant rewriting or re-architecting of existing applications. The current TTB application architecture is comprised of two-tier client/server and three-tier web-based applications that support enterprise business applications. The two-tier applications have historically been developed using standalone implementations that have resulted in data and functional redundancy and limited data analysis capabilities. The two-tier applications will be gradually migrated to three-tier webbased applications or consolidated into other TTB custom applications having similar functionality and using the same data to address these issues. Of the three Major Applications, TTB's custom applications fall within the Tax Collection and Regulatory mission support systems as supporting sub-systems. The target application inventory represents the custom applications, or sub-system set of applications that will support the target architecture. The primary focus of change for the target Applications/Services architecture involves the custom applications. For more information on how these will change please refer to the TTB EA Transition Plan. Listed below is the desired target, end-state for each custom application. Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division (ALFD) Imaging System The ALFD Imaging System will have its functionality integrated into the COLAS Online application and is part of the shared imaging service. Auto Audit The web-based version of Auto Audit will be based upon a n-tier application architecture, using Java Struts as a user interface, leveraging its existing COTS business logic as a middle-tier, and using an Oracle 10g database and associated database objects as a back end data layer, including a re-useable data exchange framework. Auto Audit will share Permit and Auditing related data with other custom applications which use that type of data. Auto Audit will be accessed through the TTB portal. Note: Auto Audit is a COTS product, and an analysis of new web-based versions or re-configuration of the current product is dependent upon vendor support. Automated Commercial System (ACS) The ACS client/server application will be converted to a set of Discoverer queries with the Oracle Forms & reports application being decommissioned. The ACS backend database will be migrated to the Oracle 10g database platform. ACS will share Tax-related data with other custom applications which use common data entities. This data will more than likely be loaded into the data warehouse. ACS will be accessed through the Customs ACE Portal. Certificate of Label Approvals (COLAs) Online COLAs Online is an Internet-based application that was launched in May 2003 from TTB's Web Portal (www.ttb.gov). This n-tier Java/J2EE based application running in TTB's Oracle environment facilitates and improves the submission and review process for alcohol beverage labels by providing an expedient

39

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

and paperless means of obtaining Federal label approval. COLAs Online is comprised of three distinct subsystems that provide targeted functionality and purpose for the three primary stakeholders; industry members (COLAs Online), TTB/ALFD (ALFD Online), and the public (COLAs Public Registry). Future enhancements to the business functionality of COLAs Online will include adding a service component that will facilitate the electronic submission of Nonbeverage Products Formulas and Beverage Alcohol Formulas. Building this service component will enable beverage and nonbeverage industry members to submit formulas online, check the status of their submissions, and receive approvals online. Processing time will be decreased by having all necessary forms and supporting documentation available online and by using automatically assigned tracking numbers. CFM Lab

65B

RLIS is an Intranet-based application and is only accessible to authorized and approved users at the Beverage Alcohol Laboratory & Nonbeverage Products Laboratory in Ammendale, MD. The Java J2EE user interface is the web-based component for the specialists to enter, link documents, search, and report on industry members NBA/SDA information. RLIS contains a shared document imaging service that allows for the retrieval of paper applications that have been scanned, uploaded, and processed by the respective applications. The Enterprise Imaging and Workflow (EIW) suite of products from Global 360 provides the components that enable the shared imaging service. As a J2EE/Java based application RLIS is already in the platform for TTB's transition end-state. The functionality of RLIS will serve as the core components for building and publishing future services; including shared security, imaging, and reporting services. In the near term, RLIS has transitioned to an Oracle 10g platform that serves as the launching point to TTB's Services Oriented Architecture. Shared Authentication/Authorization, Reporting, and Imaging services will be built and plugged into the core functionality of RLIS. Regulatory Major Application System Enhancement (RMASE) RMASE will be leveraged to significantly streamline the way TTB manages three regulatory functions vital to TTB mission success: (1) beverage alcohol formula processing and approvals, (2) certificate of label approval (COLA) issuance; and (3) nonbeverage product information processing for tax and regulatory compliance. RMASE will provide these capabilities in support of these regulatory functions in accordance with TTB system development life cycle (SDLC). Major application systems associated with RMASE include COLAs Online, Rockville Laboratory Imaging Service (RLIS), and the Integrated Revenue Information System (IRIS).

Special Occupational Tax/Floor Stock Tax (SOT/FST)

TTB Portal
68B

All target custom applications, and additional resources, including office automation resources, will be accessed through a web-based portal. Users of the portal will need to login only once, accessing all necessary applications and resources in a consistent manner. Customers and business partners can access the portal site and make use of all applications running in the portal as well. The portal will be designed for, and developed with the Java Portlet framework, ensuring compliance with the target technical standards and specifications. Note: TTB will need to conduct an analysis of how to best deploy a portal solution for accessing its resources. This may involve the use of two portals, one inside the firewall for internal users and resources, and another outside the firewall, for external users. In addition to the custom applications listed, there are a number of other resources that will support the target TTB enterprise. These include the use of application resources to support document and records management, enterprise-wide shared services - including imaging, security management and reporting services, among others.

Custom applications will be designed, developed and deployed in a consistent manner, based upon a specific methodology that results in an architecture that is modern, scalable, consistent and easily managed. Figure 16 ­ Target TTB Application Architecture Characteristics illustrates the basic characteristics that comprises the target application architecture, as outlined in this target Applications/Services layer.

The n-tier design of the target Applications/Services architecture is based upon the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Move the business logic from the presentation layer into the business logic layer (middle-tier) The migration to a thin-client presentation layer using web-based technology The use of shared services for achieving common application functionalities and capabilities An expanded data/database storage and architecture strategy

To support this architecture, TTB will port and develop application business logic into a middle tier which uses the latest version of the Java Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) framework (v 3.0 or greater). Thinclient application interfaces will be developed primarily using the Java Struts framework, as well as other technologies outlined in the target Applications/Services technology standards and specifications. The use of shared services to perform common application capabilities will be developed using the Java Web Services framework. Application data will be housed differently, through the separation of existing Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) databases into separate OLTP databases and the use of a Data

Warehouse. TTB application data will be separated and stored into OLTP databases based upon application, and into a Data Warehouse based upon subject area. Currently, few TTB applications support a 3-tier or n-tier architecture design; however, most enterprise applications will be migrated to support this target architecture. The three-tier architecture will enable TTB to employ "thin clients" that will change the overall network architecture from client-centric to server-centric. The server-centric architecture will enable TTB to reduce administration, maintenance, and deployment costs. In addition, the use of shared services such as Reporting, Security Management and Imaging, among others, for accomplishing common application capabilities will, over time, reduce development and maintenance costs associated with re-developing and maintaining those common capabilities. To help facilitate the migration to this Applications/Services architecture, a development environment based upon common toolsets will be used.

TTB has identified several capabilities, duplicated across it's custom applications, that have the potential to become shared service components. For this version of the target EA these include: Security Management, Reporting, and Imaging. Figure 18 ­ Target TTB Security Management Architecture shows a potential sample shared service, Security Management. This shared service will serve to provide authentication and authorization capabilities through integration with other areas of the target infrastructure, including PKI, LDAP-SSO, e-Authentication and Smart Card technologies. In addition, Figure 18 ­ Target TTB Security Management Architecture provides a conceptual view of a shared reporting service for use by custom applications that require reporting capabilities.

The use of a shared reporting service would involve integration with a pre-defined, common interface for the generation and presentation of reporting data used by custom applications. A shared reporting service would include the ability to handle reporting requests to run historical, transactional, or OLAP-related reports, using customizable formats. This would provide TTB with a consistent set of processes to approach data integration and reporting throughout TTB, while leveraging best reporting practices across TTB. A shared reporting service would leverage the use of Java web services, using the Apache Axis to handle Standard Object Access Protocol (SOAP) calls to execute the web services on the application server. Data and parameters passed to and from the web service would be in XML format to allow for crossplatform scalability. A business logic layer would include Java EJBs which will utilize a commonly defined data exchange framework to call database objects (stored procedures) to return report data. One area of current reporting that will be made shareable through a common reporting component includes the migration of current Oracle Discoverer reports (ALFD, NRC, and eFAPS) to leverage a data warehouse repository for common reporting data. TTB will leverage this as a common solution as more business areas and reporting requirements are defined. In addition, TTB will define, over time, the common interface for other shareable service components such as imaging, data exchange, among others. This information will be available in subsequent versions of the TTB Target EA document. A shared imaging service would be used to accomplish those imaging functions common to all custom applications that would use them, including, but not limited to, image

2.4.2 TTB Service Component Reference Model (SRM)
A Service Component Reference Model (SRM) is used to describe application capabilities and functionality. The SRM consists of a 3-tiered hierarchy, consisting of service domains, types, and components, that describes the information processing capabilities needed to support TTB's business (i.e. the ability to capture, store, access, and manipulate business data and information). The Service Component Reference Model is based upon the FEA SRM as a means for categorization of mission support systems. The OMB states "...Aligning the layers of the SRM to Agency technology, business, and application architectures enables the categorization of an Agency's IT investments, assets and infrastructure by the common definition and purpose of the Service Components in the SRM." In accordance with guidance provided from OMB and the Department of the Treasury, TTB has developed its applications/services layer in alignment with the FEA SRM. Figure 21 ­ TTB SRM Framework illustrates the SRM Framework. For a listing of service components that will exist in the target Applications/Services architecture see Appendix E, SRM Mapping.

2.5 DATA LAYER
17B

The data layer encompasses a Data Reference Model (DRM) that defines, classifies, and organizes key information assets (i.e., data) that support TTB's business processes and are managed by the bureau's applications. The DRM classifies, at a high level, the data categories that TTB uses to conduct business processes (e.g., Permits, Taxes, Labels, etc.). The data management group is responsible for the detailed definition of TTB's data (e.g., information flow models, value chains, entity relationship diagrams, etc.), which will take place through focused data architecture efforts using, in part, pre-existing standards. Developing detailed data models will provide the framework for the construction of logical data repositories and a data warehouse. These elements of an integrated data architecture allow for separation of the requirements for the data management (i.e. creation, maintenance, and deletion/archiving) from the requirements for its dissemination and use. TTB personnel at all levels require information to perform specific job functions. The factors listed below are key to ensuring that TTB is providing staff with the data and information necessary to fulfill their job responsibilities, thereby achieving TTB's strategic goals and objectives: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Access to data must be in a useful format when and where needed Information systems must have the ability to adapt to changing business needs Data must be accurate and consistent Data should be shared across the enterprise Data must be provided at reasonable, affordable costs Data security (confidentiality, integrity, and availability)

Data, organizational, and technology requirements all constrain and influence the data architecture. The EA team will work with the Data Management team to ensure that defined data requirements and standards are used consistently from data modeling and relationship diagramming to alignment with the DRM framework. This will allow for a top down / bottom up line-of-sight from a data management perspective.

2.5.1 Data Environment
36B

The target Data Environment focuses on strategic efforts within TTB to modernize existing data and database management software, as well as consolidate existing enterprise-wide information systems to better meet the needs of stakeholders. Migration to newer data and database technology, and a rearchitecting of the data and database repositories will help alleviate possible information errors, delays, and security issues. These efforts are designed to allow the appropriate data to reach concerned parties in a timely manner, as well as help to improve operations around data and database management. Furthermore, these efforts will help define a strategy for all future IT development, as well as target application and data functionality that should be extended or consolidated to better fit the requirements of the end users. The evolving TTB data architecture will have the following characteristics: ˇ ˇ ˇ Clear data definitions Complete and consistent set of entities with minimal duplication or overlap Stability of the information architecture so that the entity definitions are independent of: ­ Users ­ Location ­ Sequence of use ­ Frequency of use ­ Managing applications and technology

Key changes to the data environment and architecture include: a migration to Oracle 10g, the development and use of a data warehouse solution, and enhanced reporting services. A data warehouse solution will allow TTB to separate archived, historical data from transactional data, and provide better access to information for analysis and general reporting purposes. Data in the warehouse will be stored differently, being subject-driven, allowing for stakeholders to easily access all information that pertains to their organization (e.g., all permit, tax, label, and formula information for a brewery). The changes facilitate reporting capabilities through enhanced database design and data storage. The data warehouse will be loaded from data stored in the Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems. This will allow for analysis across similar data stores, with the ability to analyze trends of data using various points and levels of analysis. Furthermore, the Data Warehouse has the added benefit of being separate from the OLTP databases, having no effect on the performance of daily operations. Data stored in OLTP databases will be used by all custom applications in transactions that require modification to the data (insert, update, delete) in support of business processes. Custom applications will also leverage this data for reporting purposes, in conjunction with an enhanced reporting and data warehouse solution. Figure 22 ­ Target TTB Logical Database Architecture illustrates the how custom applications will share similar business-related data.

Once a data warehouse has been installed, configured and used by custom applications, there will be an ongoing need for data exchange between the OLTP databases and the data warehouse. This involves several steps that will be repeatable as an ongoing process for ensuring that the data warehouse maintains data confidentiality, integrity and availability. This process is typically referred to as Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL). Figure 24 ­ Target TTB Database Management Process illustrates the ongoing process of data replication between OLTP databases and a data warehouse.

The separation of historical data from transactional-based databases to a data warehouse will be accomplished in phases, as analysis and planning for the migration of business area data is done. Data that is stored in OLTP databases will remain for process-driven transactions, and data stored in a data warehouse will be primarily for archived storage, reporting and analysis.

TTB currently exchanges information with numerous external entities including Congress, related industry members, the public, the law enforcement community, and various local, state, and Federal government organizations. The target data environment will streamline these information exchanges by providing improved methods for collecting and disseminating information from various external sources in a consistent and efficient manner. Going forward, the utilization of web interfaces as well as participation in Federal E-Government initiatives will enable TTB's systems to exchange information with outside entities with minimal human intervention.

2.5.2 TTB Data Reference Model (DRM)
The Target Data Reference Model (DRM) contains new data categories, aligned with custom applications and the BRM lines of business. These data categories are a result of data classifications performed. Appendix G, BRM/DRM Alignment, provides the existing data categories aligned to the BRM as well as the custom applications. Currently, this alignment is only at the highest level of the DRM framework Categorization. Subsequent versions of the model will include more detailed alignments to the BRM, custom applications, as well as other areas of the architecture. The DRM provides an introduction to the roadmap and strategic approach for continuing collaborative efforts between the OMB and federal agencies to complete the DRM. The document establishes a highlevel overview of the DRM in the context of its ability to support a common approach to the categorization, exchange, and structure of data. Subsequent volumes of the model will provide more details as well as address the governance and management of data. TTB will use the existing and subsequent versions of its data architecture to help drive the transition towards data consolidation, harmonization and sharing. Figure 25 ­ TTB DRM Framework illustrates the DRM framework.

2.6 TECHNOLOGY LAYER
18B

The target Technology Layer defines the technology elements that collectively support applications, services, data, infrastructure and security at TTB. The layer supports the adoption and implementation of a service-oriented, component-based architecture by describing the standards, specifications, technologies and products that support the secure delivery, exchange, and construction of service components. The target technology layer advances the re-use of technology and service components through technology standardization and modernization. This facilitates a common, standardized technology architecture, allowing for discovery, collaboration, and interoperability of IT assets and investments. TTB will benefit by identifying and re-using the best solutions and technologies in support of its target architecture. The technology layer also defines the elements or products that TTB will use in support of the target architecture in the Technical Reference Model (TRM). The TTB EA Transition Strategy defines 25 transition programs to account for all activities that affect hardware, software and telecommunications standards, technologies and associated implementations. Some of the programs within this area are based upon government policy and mandates, others are in place as a means to modernize and enhance the TTB infrastructure. Within the Infrastructure Area there are 12 transition programs, which are described in further detail in the EA Transition Strategy: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ IPv6 Transition (Federal Mandate) HSPD12 (Federal Mandate) PKI (Strategic Initiative) LDAP / SSO (Strategic Initiative) VOIP (Strategic Initiative) Help Desk Mobility (Operational Improvement) WAN Management (Operational Improvement) SharePoint & Collaboration (Strategic Initiative) System Event Monitoring (SEM) (Strategic Initiative) 802.1X & IPSec (Strategic Initiative) Data Center Virtualization (Strategic Initiative) Handhelds (Strategic Initiative)

For additional detailed information on how the TTB enterprise will change, please refer to Appendix A, Transition Strategy Roadmap, within the EA Transition Plan.

2.6.2 TTB Technical Reference Model (TRM)
39B

The TRM supports the target architecture by ensuring that IT resources are efficiently and effectively acquired, developed, deployed, managed, operated and secured while supporting the target business, performance, applications/services and data needs of the bureau. The technical products, standards and services specified in the TRM provide an underpinning for the infrastructures that build the systems needed to support the bureau, create an open environment, ensure interoperability and accessibility and assist in reducing security vulnerabilities. The TTB TRM guides and directs decisions related to technology alignment, capital planning, and procurement. As the technical specification element of the EA, a key information technology objective will be to ensure that the IT infrastructure is based on a sound determination and selection of products, standards and services. The TRM will be supplemented by a comprehensive governance process that accommodates the regular review and assessment of pertinent technology. As a result, the TRM will ensure the ongoing evolution and enforcement of TTB's IT standards in support of the transition to the target architecture. Specifically, the TRM was created to: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Define technology standards, specifications, and recommendations that are industry-proven Focus technology standards, specifications, and recommendations on those that embrace the Internet and related approaches Create a foundation that focuses heavily on the secure delivery and construction of Service Components and their interfaces Identify the layers of a Component-Based Architecture, the supporting technologies, and recommendations for each

In developing the TRM, TTB's drivers and strategic direction were used to help define the standards, specifications and products that would be necessary to support associated capabilities within the SRM. In addition, previous TTB EA efforts were leveraged, and baseline enterprise information was used to help define standard products and specifications. Figure 29 ­ TRM Framework illustrates the TRM Framework. For a listing of all technology standards and specifications, please refer to Appendix H, TRM Mapping.

2.7 SECURITY LAYER
19B

The Security Layer of the target EA affects all other layers of the architecture and sits vertically across the other layers. TTB's security is influenced by factors that influence the target architecture and decisionmaking process. Information security is a critical component for enabling enterprise services within the context of an organization's architecture, providing the necessary safeguards for data protection and integrity. The Security Layer protects the EA through a multi-tiered system of firewalls that protect the internal network from external attackers, by limiting the types of traffic allowed in. The Security Layer performs event monitoring of traffic 24 hours a day to detect potential attacks, and runs scans of the user and server subnets to detect potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. All sensitive data stored on user's laptops is encrypted with FIPS 140-2 compliant algorithms and PointSec software to protect data in the event of a theft or loss. Legislative and regulatory security guidelines, laws and directives, other applicable policies and security best practices influence the Security Architecture as well. Refer to Appendix I, TTB Security Architecture Document (currently under development), for details regarding TTB's Security Architecture.

2.7.1 Security Environment

The target security environment will utilize enhanced remote access capabilities, allowing for SSL-based VPN connections into the TTB network. In addition, encryption will be used on client machine hard drives, database server files, E-mail traffic and off-line storage files as a measure to protect and ensure data confidentiality. Access to TTB resources will, over time, be accomplished by leveraging PKI, LDAP and Smart Card capabilities, as well as e-Authentication. Additionally, all users accessing TTB data remotely will be required to use RSA SecurID two-factor authentication. This will ensure that users of the bureau's resources are authenticated and authorized in a standard, secure manner. The security environment will also leverage Treasury's Trusted Agent web solution to streamline the POA&M management process. For more information on the technology standards and specifications of the target security environment, please see Appendix H, TRM Mapping. E-Authentication, LDAP and PKI
95B

TTB will use a combination of identity management solutions, including LDAP and PKI certificates in order to provide its users and clients with the ability to easily authenticate. This will be accomplished by leveraging the Department of the Treasury's PKI which will provide users with certificates which can be used to identify them. Additionally the PKI will enable users to digitally sign documents which will improve workflow. Host-Based IDS
96B

A host-based IDS will be installed on workstations and servers in order to provide intrusion detection and prevention capabilities at the host level. This will provide TTB security personnel with more information

64

Appendix X
U.S. Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Target Enterprise Architecture Version 4.0 2/01/08

of how attacks originate and travel through the network, and will give them a better understanding of the overall status of the network. Two-Factor Authentication Two factor authentication provides added security to TTB's infrastructure and users who are accessing it remotely. To support two factor authentication, USB RSA SecureID tokens have been provided to the TTB user base, which will require users to combine their PIN with the token-code before being granted access to the network via VPN or neo.treas.gov. Trusted Agent FISMA TTB will leverage the Department of the Treasury's Trusted Agent FISMA tool to streamline the POA&M management process. Trusted Agent FISMA provides a web-based interface for TTB to add, delete, and manage POA&M weaknesses. It will also provide TTB with the ability to generate reports that will quickly determine the status of ongoing weaknesses. Full-Disk Hard Drive Encryption All TTB workstations and laptops are currently equipped with the Pointsec for PC full disk hard drive encryption. This software encrypts all data on a user's hard drive, and requires them to authenticate before being granted access to the data. This will protect the data stored on a workstation or laptop in the event of theft of loss of hardware, and prevent information from being shared outside TTB. Workstations and laptops will be equipped with Pointsec Media Encryption to provide TTB the capability to encrypt data on external devices with minimal user interaction. It also allows users to share encrypted files between agencies, contractors, and business partners.

Background. The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has overall responsibility for the TTB IT Program. The TTB IT components are defined as the combination of the architecture and infrastructure, including communications, documentation, and production/operational versions of systems that support the Bureau's mission. The OCIO has developed guidelines to operate the TTB IT in an efficient manner, within prescribed budget and schedule constraints, and responsive to TTB mission requirements. To ensure adequate management and control over changes to the TTB IT components, the Handbook is developed to establish Bureau-wide Configuration Management (CM) guidelines and processes. CM provides processes, tools, and reports that permit an organized means for tracking and making changes to software systems, processes, and hardware throughout the lifecycle of a project and to the Bureau-wide IT components.

6.

Definitions Refer to Appendix G: Acronyms and Definitions of the Handbook.

7.

Requirements The sections and subsections of the Handbook describe required processes to be followed for the successful implementation of a CM program at TTB.

8.

Anticipated Outcomes and Results A successful implementation of a CM program at TTB will increase the productivity of project managers, developers and infrastructure specialists. The major benefit of CM is that all changes to the systems supported by TTB will be monitored and controlled. Other contributions include accurately reporting status of changes to the IT components so that issues and risks can be addressed quickly, coordinating activities so that all responsible parties are aware of their assigned work and schedule, and automating repetitive tasks so that development lifecycles can be shortened. The CM program will offer the TTB IT staff a centralized location for their work products that will provide a detailed history of those work products. This repository will also be used to store all the process documentation required to provide project managers with the tools to effectively control and implement change. The TTB CM program will improve customer satisfaction by providing the ability to deliver revisions and enhancements in a timely manner. Effective CM will ensure that software releases specifically address the requested changes and that delivered applications contain fewer errors. The CM program will offer TTB the

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW
OVERVIEW OF CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT PROCESS AT TTB
17B

3.1

The configuration management process at TTB consists of configuration item identification, establishing baselines, configuration control and change control of the configuration items. CM also involves configuration audits and configuration status accounting of the configuration items under the control of the CMO. The following paragraphs briefly describe what is involved in each of these activities. 3.1.1
29B

Configuration Item Identification

A Configuration Item (CI) is any item, product, or artifact to be tracked and controlled to maintain project integrity. A CI may be a collection or aggregation of hardware, software, firmware, documentation, and/or other items that satisfies a system-level function, or for other reasons is treated as an entity for the purpose of CM. Configuration identification provides a hierarchical view of the system, showing progressive decomposition into CIs, components, and at the lowest level, Configuration Units (CUs). CUs are the smallest elements that can be stored in a CM repository whereas CIs provide a higher level view into the system and are more suitable for providing meaningful management visibility and tracking. A CI can also be a CU. The system element may be important enough to merit management visibility and get a CI designation. From a technical perspective it may also be at the lowest level and thus be tracked accordingly. These items may vary in complexity, size, and type. Configuration identification consists of: ˇ Defining CI selection criteria ˇ Selecting and documenting CIs ˇ Assigning unique numbers and/or other identifiers to the CIs and to the technical documentation that describes them 3.1.2
30B

Baselines

A baseline represents a product that has been formally reviewed and approved, which then serves as the basis for further development, and can be changed only through formal change control procedures. As part of establishing baselines, completed CIs and related artifacts will be formally brought under the control of the CMO. The baseline is the point of discussion for requests for changes. A baseline can be any of the following: ˇ An agreed-upon description of the attributes of a product, at a point in time, which serves as a basis for defining change ˇ An approved and released document, or a set of documents, each of a specific revision, the purpose of which is to provide a defined basis for managing change ˇ The currently approved and released configuration documentation ˇ A released set of files comprising a software version and associated configuration documentation

Configuration Management Handbook

Configuration control is the process to control, manage, and maintain an audit trail for hardware, software, COTS, and documentation using a formal change management process during the lifecycle stages of a project. Configuration control involves version control and build control. Version control includes identifying different versions of a configuration item (CI) and its components and maintaining their logical relationships. Build control includes integration of elements of the system and creating releases. Configuration control is closely tied to the change management activities including tracking changes to versions, ensuring that all approved changes and no unapproved changes are applied, and establishing baselines. 3.1.4
32B

Change Control

Change control is the process of ensuring that changes to a controlled configuration, or any component product of a controlled configuration, are authorized. The Change Control process provides the structure for ensuring that all changes to controlled items are identified, evaluated, and tracked in a consistent manner and that only approved changes are applied to controlled products. Change control activities are performed to provide a stable environment for baselining products to include software, hardware, and documentation. A proposed change to a baseline component or other controlled product is documented in an RFC. The RFC is the vehicle for the request, approval, implementation, and validation of a proposed change. Completed RFCs are retained as a permanent, detailed record of the product's change history. The CMO maintains physical and electronic records to manage RFCs and reports the status of these items to TTB Program and project personnel.

3.1.5
3B

Configuration Status Accounting

Configuration Status Accounting (CSA) involves activities to provide the means for reporting the status of all CIs and associated descriptions, proposed changes, and the implementation and validation of approved changes to the CIs. CSA reports provide snapshots of configurations as of a specified date for information collected during CM activities. CSA activities include maintaining inventory of all CIs, preparing reports of all activities against CIs, status of RFCs and compiling metrics related to the CM activities. 3.1.6
34B

Configuration Audits

Configuration audits determine the adherence of individual projects to CM processes for CM controlled products. Configuration audits also ensure that the physical baseline (hardware, software, etc.) conforms to the documented baseline. The CMO conducts internal audits on a periodic basis to ensure the CM processes are being followed by the TTB projects.

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT APPROACH AT TTB

The Configuration Management approach at TTB involves a three-level approach to CM to ensure the following: ˇ The integrity and reliability of the IT Infrastructure

2/26/2009

Appendix XII

Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau ˇ ˇ

Configuration Management Handbook

All systems in production or in an operational state that are either purchased, developed or maintained within the Bureau comply with CM and pose no threat to integrity and reliability of overall TTB infrastructure Changes to TTB IT processes are reviewed, approved, and their implementation coordinated

The first level focuses on the IT Infrastructure baseline, which is a collection of baselines that identify items that comprise the IT Infrastructure at both a high level and a detailed component level. The second level focuses on the internal baselines of individual systems and applications that are installed or hosted on the IT Infrastructure. The third level focuses on the process baselines that detail standard operating procedures for the OCIO. A project-level CCB supports project-level baselines while both AWG and E-CCB support activities at all the levels. 3.2.1
35B

IT Infrastructure Baseline

The focus of the Information Technology baseline is the production Infrastructure (architecture, communication and interfaces, production versions of Commercial Off The Shelf software (COTS)/ Government Off The Shelf systems (GOTS), custom-built applications, voice systems and hosted systems). This includes IT documentation such as architectural drawings, wiring diagrams, requirements documents and baseline version descriptions with identification to the component level, device names and addresses and any other required TTB SDLC documentation. The IT baseline includes Local Area Network/Wide Area Network (LAN/WAN) platform specific hardware and software; routers; modems; servers; interfaces; standard personal computer hardware configurations; personal computer software; and the operational versions of systems and applications hosted on the IT Infrastructure. All infrastructure items will be baselined and maintained under configuration control. 3.2.2
36B

System Baseline

The focus of the system baseline is on CM applied at the system level for stand-alone systems as well as hosted systems that are either developed and/or maintained by the OCIO. System level CM is implemented to control changes to a system throughout its lifecycle as described in the TTB SDLC. The OCIO is responsible for managing internal changes and ensuring that any impacts to interoperability or compatibility are identified and resolved prior to any change to the system baseline. The level of CM applied to a system shall be appropriate to the scope of the system (size, number of interfaces, risks), and the SDLC phase. In the event that there is a proposed change to the system that will impact an interface between a system and another IT system or an external system, the change to the interface must be reviewed, approved, and its implementation coordinated by the appropriate working group. Deliverables from all SDLC phases, SOPs, templates, guidelines and documentation will be brought under configuration control. 3.2.3
37B

Process Baseline

The focus of the process baseline is on CM applied on processes, guidelines, standards, plans, procedures and directives that support TTB IT. All divisions of the OCIO maintain process related documentation under the control of the CM. The OCIO is responsible for managing internal changes and ensuring that any impacts to the IT process baselines are identified and resolved prior to any change. In the event that there is a proposed change to the process baseline, the change must be reviewed, approved, and its implementation coordinated by the appropriate

working group. Changes or new components that have bureau-wide impact should be coordinated with the Regulations and Rulings Division of TTB.

3.3

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT AND THE TTB SDLC

The TTB CMO manages and monitors the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the Bureau. The CM Handbook provides guidelines and CM processes to be followed during each phase of the TTB SDLC. The TTB SDLC describes various artifacts to be delivered during the life cycle phases and guides projects to identify corresponding configuration items. The CMO maintains and controls the artifacts resulting from various phases of the SDLC. As part of the SDLC deliverable, a CM Plan will be developed for each project that describes the CM activities specific to the project and details the CM process to be followed by the project based on the CM Handbook. The project CM Plan identifies configuration items specific to the project, the process to bring them under the control of CM and describes the project specific procedures to build and promote software items. A template of the project CM plan can be found embedded in the TTB SDLC Handbook. 3.4 TRAINING

The CMO develops and maintains the CM Handbook, relevant processes and CM Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and templates to be followed by the Bureau and projects. The CMO also develops and maintains training material to cover all CM requirements, processes and tools. The CMO schedules training sessions on a regular and on ad hoc basis to train required Bureau employees, projects personnel and subcontractors on the CM requirements, processes and CM tools. Depending on the individual project size, the CMO can choose to train the project CM specialist, who in turn trains the project personnel. The project staff, including subcontractors and vendors, is responsible for understanding the requirements defined in the project CM Plan as they apply to the performance of their project duties, and for complying with the processes and procedures established to maintain the integrity of the project products.

CONFIGURATION IDENTIFICATION
CONFIGURATION ITEM SELECTION AND DESCRIPTION
21B

4.1

Configuration identification is the process of identifying CIs to be controlled under CM and documenting their characteristics. These items may vary considerably in complexity, size, and type depending on the type of project and business, technical requirements. Configuration management applies to any item that should be controlled through the change control process. The CM Manager works with the project lead/manager for selecting CIs and defining the configuration hierarchy and consults the CMO staff as necessary. Documenting, tracking, and ensuring that changes to CIs are approved is the responsibility of the CMO. Configuration identification involves the following activities: ˇ Define CI selection criteria ˇ Select and document CIs ˇ Assign CI identifiers ˇ Prepare CI List (CIL) Each project defines the CI selection criteria appropriate to the project. Each project or initiative can define its own CI and CU identification scheme to uniquely identify each CI and CU. The system/project requirements report, interface and integration requirements with other systems, the SDLC and any existing CI list provide input to identify the CIs. Based on the system structure, the project's CIs will be selected and relevant CUs will be identified. Supporting artifacts, software will be identified against each CI. Baseline documents and other configuration-controlled artifacts will be associated with each CI. As part of the CI identification, each project or initiative prepares a CIL that includes the CIs and CUs that will be placed under configuration management. The CIL will be submitted to the CMO for establishing the CI structure for the project/initiative in the CM tool. Examples of CIs include source code, SDLC documents, database definitions, servers, routers, and internal and external interfaces. Examples of work products that are not CIs include project memorandums and other documentation not directly associated with a system. 4.1.1
38B

Infrastructure

The following is a list of general infrastructure related CIs that shall be placed under CM control: ˇ Architecture diagrams ˇ Backup devices ˇ Network Diagrams ˇ Disaster Recovery Plans ˇ Hotfixes ˇ Hubs ˇ Operating Systems ˇ Patch Sets ˇ Routers ˇ SANs ˇ Scanners

BASELINES

A system baseline is a logical grouping of CIs that constitutes the system at a specific point in time. Baselines should be established at predetermined points. Projects must determine necessary baselines depending on the type of project, new development or maintenance. Below is the minimal set of baselines required for a project: ˇ Requirements Baseline: System requirements ˇ Design (allocated) Baseline: Design specifications ˇ Development & Test Baseline: Configuration of hardware or software during the design, coding, and testing phases ˇ Release (product) Baseline: Approved products delivered to the customer Certain projects may require a waiver for one or more of these baselines based on contractual requirements or other project specific demands. After a CI has been formally reviewed and approved it will be brought under the control of CMO and deposited in the CM tool as a CI baseline. When a product is ready to be placed under formal

Configuration Management Handbook

configuration control in the CM repository, the development organization responsible for the delivery prepares the turnover package and delivers it to the CMO. If a product of a project is to be baselined, the developing organization should prepare an End of Phase Acceptance Form (EPAF) or a Deliverable Product Acceptance Form (DPAF). An EPAF is necessary to move deliverables from one phase of the project to another. A DPAF is necessary to baseline a version of a CI. CM receives inputs from the project development team in the form of a completed Deployment Plan (DP) or Software Version Description (SVD) document. This document describes the elements to be included in the build and provides special instructions section on how to construct the build. At the end of phase, the completed EPAF along with the SVD should be submitted to the CMO. The CMO staff performs or coordinates with the Operations Group for the functions required to promote the product(s) and notifies the appropriate personnel that the release is ready for intended use. Once CIs are baselined, required changes must go through the formal configuration change process and be reviewed and approved by appropriate CCB. If a product or document already has a baseline, changes will be applied to them to make a new baseline. 4.2.1 Hardware

The base level artifacts for hardware CM consist of the appropriate descriptions of hardware configurations, installation instructions, etc. Hardware equipment is placed under configuration control after it is installed, configured, and validated by the engineers/vendor representatives. The CMO maintains this configuration information. A hardware CI baseline contains the configuration and installation instructions for each piece of equipment (box, router, etc) installed. The equipment placed under configuration control requires approval process in order to change the initial configuration. During the time the equipment is physically being brought up, interfaced, and until the installation is completed and tested through communication, the installation lead/manager manages it. 4.2.2 Software

The base level artifacts for software comprise of CIs from custom developed client-server applications, web-based applications and any special desktop software and associated information. As described in section 4.1, at the beginning of a project, a CIL should be submitted as part of the project CM plan to the CMO by the PM. Based on the project CIL, the CMO sets-up a separate environment in the CM tool for the project. During the development and unit test stages of the project, the CIs will be under the PM or project's CM specialist's working area and management. Upon completion of the unit testing or peer approvals, the products will be placed under `managed-level' control. Once the development phase is complete, the PM submits a DP or SVD and EPAF to the CMO. After QA review and approval, the CMO creates `strict level' baselines of the source code corresponding to the CIs in the test environments. The CMO coordinates build, promote and software release activities based on the DP or SVD instructions into the ETET, IV&V and UAT environments. Depending on the SDLC phases, the software will be tested and approved appropriately. The DP or SVD will be updated based on the findings during the test phases. This DP or SVD will be used as the basis on which the software is built and released in the production environment, and the source code will be moved into `strict level' control of the CM and will be established as production baselines.

Appendix XII

Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau

Configuration Management Handbook

The base level artifacts for COTS CM are the appropriate descriptions of COTS configurations, installation instructions, etc. COTS implementation projects follow the same process as described for the software projects. The COTS DP or SVD contains vendor provided configuration files, TTB specific changed configuration and vendor-supplied patches. It does not contain copyright vendor software source files. After formal testing and approval, the CMO establishes `strict-level' baseline configuration and releases into production environment. The COTS package is then configuration managed and an approval process is required in order to change the baseline configuration. Any vendor-supplied patches should also go through the CMO established change control process. 4.2.4
4B

Documentation

Documents such as process documents relevant to a project, initiative, Bureau-wide procedural information, guidelines memorandums and supporting documentation follow the same general CM process. Appropriate approval authority (e.g., CCB, PM) approves changes to the documentation. Any change to a baseline document should also go through the CMO established change control process. 4.3
23B

LEVEL OF CONTROL

All CIs are kept under two different levels of controls ­ Strict-level control and Managed-level control. All the strict-level control CIs will be checked into Dimensions and the project manager will maintain managed-level control CIs in an access controlled network shared drive or SharePoint website. Documents will be moved from managed-level to strict-level control following the different review and approval processes described below. 4.3.1
45B

Strict Control

Strict control is the highest level of control assigned to a CI by the CMO. Strict controlled CIs are baselined with proper reviews and CCB authorization, and any changes are controlled by the appropriate CCB. The CM Manager allows low impact changes after approval by the P-CCB and high impact changes require the approval of E-CCB. The CCB authorization is required for checking out the CIs for modifications. Examples of CIs that will be kept under strict control include Hardware configuration details, SDLC deliverables such as Requirements Documents, SVD, Design/System Document, Software and User Manuals. Changes are subject to a formal review process and authorization, which includes the following: ˇ Peer Review ˇ Quality Assurance (QA) Review ˇ Appropriate CCB Review and Authorization ˇ PM Authorization Refer to Appendix A: TTB Standard CI List for the level of control associated with each CI. 4.3.2
46B

Managed Control

Managed control is an intermediate level of control used to manage the work products that are not part of the software baseline, but require temporary change control. Work products placed under managed-control are related to managing the process, are not baselined, and do not require CCB authorization for changes. The managed-control CIs reside on a shared drive or SharePoint

2/26/2009

Configuration Management Handbook

website as determined by the project. Authorization by the CI owner or PM is required for modifications to the products that are under managed-level control. Required reviews are dependent on the type of work products and are identified in the Work Product Review Matrix in the project's QA Plan. Examples of managed control CIs may include project plan, project specific SOPs, schedules, agendas and minutes. 4.3.3 Working Area

Each project or initiative shall maintain a working area as a repository for CIs and work products that are under development. The CMO processes do not control the project's working area. The working area is part of the project's Process Asset Library (PAL). Once a work product is approved it should be placed under CMO control and removed from the working area. The working area resides on a shared drive or on local drives as determined by the project. 4.4 4.4.1 ORGANIZATIONAL ASSET LIBRARY Structure

The TTB CM Manager is responsible for setup of a repository structure to maintain all the organizational CIs under the control of CM and providing proper authorizations to the CMO staff and projects' personnel. An organization-level PAL structure has been established within Serena Dimensions as a repository for all electronic copies of the CIs. The PAL structure corresponds to various environments including ETET, IV&V, UAT and Production. Under each environment, various sublevel repositories are created for each project, system or application and subdivided based on the CI types. Refer to Appendix B: Dimensions Promotion Models for a graphical depiction of how CIs will be moved from one environment to the next environment. All strict controlled CI baselines should be properly deposited in corresponding environments following proper authorizations described in Section 5, Configuration Control. The PAL also contains all physical CIs. The physical CIs are kept in a locked, access-controlled cabinet located at TTB headquarters in Washington, D.C. Examples of physical assets include signed documentation and hard copies of vendor-supplied instruction manuals. 4.4.2 Tools

The AWG has approved the use of Serena's Dimensions as the CM Tool to be used to support TTB CMO activities. Dimensions will be used for controlling, versioning, labeling, baselining, and archiving electronic copies of CIs. Dimensions can also be used to implement a change management solution that records and updates change documents including, but not limited to, RFCs. Dimensions is configured to permit version control and to limit access and promotion rights to an approved subset of users. Dimensions provides automated version control and allows setup of directory spaces for individual projects and tasks with proper authorizations. Projects are required to use Dimensions for strict-controlled work products. Teams may use tools based on contractual requirements or other project specific demands after approval by the CMO.

4.5

NAMING STANDARDS

All strictly controlled CIs must follow the naming standards described below. The naming standards are different for different types of CIs and are classified as Hardware, Software, COTS and Documentation.
2/26/2009 Page 15 TTB H 7260.1A OPI: OCIO POC: Assistant CIO

Appendix XII

Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau

Configuration Management Handbook

4.5.1

Hardware CI Naming Standards

All CIs that describe hardware should consist of product name followed by an underscore, followed by the appropriate serial number to the lowest replaceable unit (LRU) followed by an underscore, followed by the standard product type. <Product name>_<Serial number>_<Product type> For example: Dell_GLDY111_GX150_Desktop 4.5.2 Software CI Naming Standards

Where practical, all CIs that describe software products should consist of standard software or application name, followed by an underscore, followed by appropriate source code name followed by a period ("."), followed by the standard software type. In general, for CIs that are source code, the naming standards for source code will be aligned with the guidelines provided for software used by TTB, including Java, Oracle and web files. < Software or Application name >_< Source code name >.<Software type> For example: FET_menu.fmb 4.5.3 COTS CI Naming Standards

In the event that a COTS CI should need to be checked into the CM tool, and where practical, all CIs that describe COTS products should consist of standard system name followed by an underscore, followed by the product name, followed by an underscore, followed by the appropriate release number or a patch number. In general, for CIs that are COTS products, the naming standards will be aligned with the guidelines provided for COTS vendors. <System name>_< Product name >_<Release or Patch number> For example: Microsoft_Word_9.0.3128 4.5.4 Documentation CI Naming Standards

For CIs that are documents and are associated with a project, system or application, the document file names should consist solely of the standard system acronym for the system to which the document pertains, followed by an underscore, followed by the appropriate standard document acronym, followed by a period ("."), followed by the standard Windows file extension for the type of file. This is also represented as follows: <Application acronym>_<Document acronym>.<Document type> For example: IRIS_FRD.doc For CIs that are bureau-wide documents, the document file names should consist of the standard TTB organization name followed by an underscore, followed by the appropriate document category, followed by an underscore, followed by the appropriate standard document name, followed by a period ("."), followed by the standard Windows file extension for the type of file.

documents that are date specific, the document name could include date at the end of the document name ­ Document name, followed by an underscore, and followed by date in the format "yyyymmdd". This is also represented as follows: <TTB Org Name>_<Document category>_<Document name>.<Document type> <TTB Org Name>_<Document category>_<Document name_yyyymmdd>.<Document type> Examples of the documents associated with software management organization include the following: Form: SW_CM_RFC_Form.dot Template: SW_SDLC_PMP_Template.dot SOP: SW_CM_Cataloging_Hardware_SOP.doc Checklist: SW_SDLC_PPC.dot Handbook: SW_SDLC_Handbook.doc Version numbers should not be used in the filename for files that are stored in Dimensions. Version labels are used to track CI baselines and version numbers for corresponding file revisions. Dimensions assigns file version labels automatically. Version labels must be used on all strict CIs. The following are version label guidelines required for CIs: ˇ Version labels for strict controlled source code: version labels are assigned for each baseline and software build ˇ Version labels for strict controlled documents: version labels are assigned for each baseline and approved document version The following standards should be followed to name documents: ˇ File names must be in title case (first letter of every word is capitalized) ˇ Underscores are used instead of spaces ˇ Any acronyms used when naming files must be documented in the project's CM Plan ˇ All acronyms must be capitalized ˇ Acronyms must be followed by an underscore if followed by another word ˇ The proper project acronym is to be placed in front of the document name ˇ File names may not exceed 32 characters. Vowels are removed from words in the document name in order to reduce the number of characters in a name if necessary ˇ File names must have a file extension identifying the application Table 1, on the next page, provides standard acronyms for CIs to be listed in Dimensions. This list will be enhanced on a regular basis to include new acronyms.

CONFIGURATION CONTROL

All hardware, software, COTS, and documentation CIs that are baselined will be under configuration control of the CMO. Through the formal change control process described below, CMO controls any changes to the baselines. CMO maintains an audit trail of the changes and applies version control to maintain logical relationships of the CIs. The CMO controls release of new versions of the software and COTS and maintains integration of elements of the system via build control. The CMO controls test and production environments under strict control and requires E-CCB or P-CCB approval for release in either environment. 5.1 CONFIGURATION CONTROL OF BASELINES

Any change to a baselined CI is controlled and requires a corresponding RFC or change initiated via help desk or a problem reported to the help desk. All change requests will be documented, reviewed for impacts and risks, then approved or denied. All approved changes will be implemented and relevant baselines and documentation will be updated. The CM Manager will manage version numbers. All change requests will be coordinated by the designated project lead. If a project lead is not designated, change requests will be handled directly by the CM Manager. The users can submit change requests via help desk or directly to the project lead. Paragraphs below describe how the change requests are handled. The help desk will forward the user initiated change request as a help ticket to the appropriate project lead. The project lead will determine whether the help ticket can be processed by P-CCB or must be submitted to the E-CCB or the AWG for review. If the project lead determines that the E-CCB or the AWG must review the request, the project lead will notify the user that an RFC with SDLC documentation must be prepared. Once the RFC with SDLC documentation is prepared, it is forwarded to the CM Manager who inputs the RFC into the change control process. The CM Manager will review with the project lead other help tickets that may be consolidated into the RFC for consideration. Figure 1 is a diagram of the User Change Initiation Process via the helpdesk.

The E-CCB and the AWG, if required, will review RFCs and supporting SDLC documentation to determine the technical impact associated with the request. The RFC Review Checklist will be used to determine whether all pertinent issues have been addressed and required personnel resources are available to satisfy the request. Refer to Appendix C RFC Template for the RFC template. Refer to Appendix D RFC Review Checklist for more details. The RFC Tracking System is the repository for collecting and maintaining change control data throughout the process. The RFC tracking system will capture associated information when the request becomes an RFC. This ensures that there will be a linkage and history for all requests. Requests are maintained to assist in the management of the systems and the CMO. 5.2 BUILD, PROMOTION AND RELEASE CONTROL

The CMO staff supports and coordinates software builds and promotions during the ETET, IV&V, UAT and Production deployment phases. At the end of each phase or when a deliverable is accepted, the CMO receives a completed DP or SVD along with a signed EPAF or a signed DPAF from the project lead, to build and/or promote the products according to delivery specifications on the form and instructions in DP or SVD. After review and approval of the DP or SVD by the Software Maintenance and Infrastructure Group, the CMO baselines the artifacts in the CMO Dimensions repository by applying the appropriate CM label. The CMO then performs or coordinates with the Maintenance Operations Group to build (if needed) or to create the executable and incorporates any other software components required to run the system as specified in the DP or SVD. If the build is successful, the CMO coordinates with the Maintenance Operations Group to copy the files to the platform specified on the EPAF or DPAF and deliver the new baseline release via appropriate method. If there are build errors, the CMO notifies the project lead of the problem. Upon completion of a successful build, CMO notifies the appropriate project organizations or the PM of the build/promotion/release. Appendix E EPAF Template provides the TTB's EPAF template Appendix F DPAF Template provides the TTB's DPAF template 5.3 PROCESSING REQUESTS FOR CHANGE

As described in Section 5.1 above, users may submit an RFC via the help desk or complete an RFC form and send it directly to the project lead to initiate the formal change process. After an RFC is received, the user or project lead will complete the RFC form with appropriate, supporting SDLC documentation. The required SDLC documentation depends upon the type of change and the potential level of impact. The RFC may need to be accompanied by a description of the current baseline and the proposed future baseline. These documents and the RFC Project Checklist will be used to evaluate the impact on the IT Components. The project lead will work with the CM Manager to determine if the submitted RFC can be managed at the P-CCB level or should to go to the AWG or the E-CCB. The project lead and CM Manager or CMO staff will ensure the RFC is completed correctly. The RFC will then be added to the agenda of the appropriate governing body.

Configuration Management Handbook

P-CCB Review Process of RFC

In general, the P-CCB deals with any changes to a baseline that has a low-impact and meets the following criteria: ˇ Change is within the context of an already active project ˇ Change is confined to a specific existing software, process or related documentation ˇ Change can take place within allocated budget and planned schedule ˇ Change does not involve changes to the infrastructure ˇ Change does not alter bureau-wide procedures or security ˇ Change does not affect other projects or systems ˇ Changes that have an impact assessment rating of 1 or 2 If appropriate, the RFC will be discussed at the P-CCB meeting where it will be evaluated for its compliance with the existing standards of the software and processes established when the previous baselines were established. Individuals requesting changes are required to either attend the P-CCB meeting or send a knowledgeable representative to present the request and associated plan. If the individual requesting the change or a representative is not available at the meeting, the request will be deferred and the review postponed until someone is available. The PCCB will review and evaluate the specifications of a proposed change. If any issues arise, the PCCB may propose solutions or send the RFC to the CM Manager for AWG and E-CCB review. The P-CCB may also reject the change requests in the current form. In general, the P-CCB review process of RFCs follows a similar process to that followed by the E-CCB as described in section 5.3.3. Upon review and approval of the P-CCB, project lead can work with the CM Manager to complete the implementation of the change. 5.3.2
5B

AWG Review Process of RFC

If appropriate, the RFC will be discussed at the AWG meeting where it will be evaluated for its compliance with the technical standards maintained by the AWG. Individuals requesting changes to the IT baseline are required to either attend the AWG meeting or send a technically knowledgeable representative to present the request and associated plan. The presentation to the board will include logical and/or physical architecture and align to the Target EA. If the individual requesting the change or a representative is not available at the meeting, the request will be deferred and the review postponed until someone is available. The AWG will review and evaluate the technical specifications of a proposed IT initiative. If any issues arise, the AWG may propose solutions to technical obstacles and suggest an implementation plan. The group will vote on whether a proposed IT initiative is in technical conformance with TTB's architecture and communicate the results to the project lead. The AWG may reject proposals that compromise the IT baseline. During the review, all AWG members in attendance or their designated alternates can voice opinions and participate in discussion pertinent to the RFC. After a thorough review of available documentation and consideration of input from the requester or designated representative, the AWG will vote on the RFC. RFC approvals require a unanimous vote of AWG members. After the formal presentation and vote has been taken on the RFC, the chairperson annotates the RFC as approved, approved with contingencies, denied, or deferred per the criteria in Table 3. The RFC will be forwarded to the E-CCB for further review. 5.3.3

Appendix XII

Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau

Configuration Management Handbook

The E-CCB will determine whether the RFC can be approved/disapproved at the E-CCB level, or whether the RFC must be forwarded to the IRB. The E-CCB will review the RFC, baseline information, affected SDLC documentation and the RFC Project Checklist to identify any implementation risks. The E-CCB will ensure that the requestor has consulted with the Office of Training & Professional Development to assess the impact of specific training needs, before any changes with a training component are implemented. For RFCs that affect the TTB Data Center, the Data Center Checklist will be completed and submitted with the RFC for review by the E-CCB. The RFC Project Checklist and the Data Center Checklist serve to prompt requesters on considerations that affect the delivery and performance of the IT network and systems. The nature and scope of RFCs will vary as will the affected SDLC documentation submitted with the RFC. The E-CCB's responsibility is to determine that sufficient analysis has occurred and that this information is documented and attached to the RFC so a complete review by the E-CCB and the IRB, if required, can take place. The activities that may occur during the analysis of a proposed RFC are: ˇ ˇ Convening of a Working Group o The type of RFC (application, database, infrastructure, etc.) will determine the type and level of technical expertise required for the working group membership Structured Walk-Through o This is a review process in which a designer or programmer leads one or more people through a segment of design or code that he or she has written, while the other members ask questions and make comments about technique, style, possible errors, violations of development standards, and other problems Peer Review o A peer review is an examination or review and validation of work product(s) produced by an individual/group by others in the same occupation for conformance with acceptable standards and guidelines

ˇ

When the members of the E-CCB are satisfied that the RFC documentation is complete and all initial issues are resolved, they will initiate the technical and cost analysis. If the determination is that the E-CCB can act on the RFC without IRB input, the E-CCB can request that the RFC submitter provide their business case/justification for approving the RFC. After conducting a thorough review of documentation and any inputs or presentations made by the requester, the E-CCB will vote on the RFC. RFC approvals require a unanimous vote of the E-CCB membership. After the formal presentation and vote has been taken on the RFC, the chairperson will annotate the RFC with one of the decision statuses below.

Configuration Management Handbook

Status Description Changes approved with no contingencies shall be authorized with an expected completion due date. Changes approved with contingencies shall be authorized with an expected completion due date. The appropriate manager is responsible for verifying that all contingencies have been met prior to implementation of the change. Contingency information will be added to the RFC for tracking purposes. The status of these requests shall be changed to Approved once the contingencies are met. Denied requests shall be given the status of closed and returned to the requester with the reason for denial. Deferred requests shall be assigned a consideration date for rehearing following additional investigation or review. If necessary, a working group will be set up to resolve questions. RFCs with a Deferred status will be placed on the agenda for the next meeting, unless the requestor requests additional time to resolve issues. Change that has been deemed to be irrelevant or overcome by events (OBE) within the organization and/or project team.

Denied Deferred

Withdrawn

The submitters of the RFC will be notified of the P-CCB or E-CCB decisions. The E-CCB may determine that the RFC must be considered by the IRB. In this case, requisite information, affected SDLC documentation and appropriate checklists will be forwarded to the IRB chair for inclusion on the agenda. 5.3.4 IRB Review Process of RFC

The IRB meets as required to discuss RFCs that have been forwarded by the E-CCB. The IRB Review process is as follows: IRB members should review RFCs prior to scheduled meetings and be prepared to discuss issues about the RFC that are of concern. Individuals requesting changes to the IT baseline are required to either attend the IRB meeting as requested or send a technically knowledgeable representative to present the request and associated plan if required. If the individual requesting the change or a representative is not available at the meeting, the request will be deferred and the review postponed until someone is available. During the review, all attendees can voice opinions and participate in discussion of the RFC. After conducting a thorough review of available documentation and consideration of input from the requester or designated representative, the IRB votes on the RFC. RFC approvals require a consensus vote from IRB members. If the IRB approves but funding is not already available, the IRB will add it to a portfolio forwarded to ERB.

ERB Review Process of RFC

IRB recommends a portfolio of projects to ERB for consideration. ERB meets as required to discuss the portfolio of IT projects that have been forwarded by the IRB. ERB members should review the portfolio prior to scheduled meetings and be prepared to discuss issues about specific RFCs that are of concern. During the review, all attendees can voice opinions and participate in discussion of the portfolio. After conducting a thorough review of available documentation and consideration of input from the requester or designated representatives, ERB decides whether to accept the portfolio or to return it to the IRB for further review or consideration of specific issues. 5.3.6

Emergency RFC

Requests requiring immediate attention (non-routine) will be handled as Emergency RFCs. Emergency changes are defined as highly critical changes that must be implemented immediately to resolve problems that have adversely affected a system hosted on the ITor have made it impossible for some users of the IT Infrastructure to perform their work. Due to the critical nature of these changes and the impacts if they are not expeditiously resolved, emergency changes are processed per the following policy: ˇ Identify problem and proposed resolution ˇ Document the solution and provide notice to P-CCB or E-CCB or AWG members ˇ Get verbal authorization from the appropriate CCB or AWG members to implement resolution ˇ Walk the RFC through the CCB or AWG members for signature, if possible ˇ After normal hours, e-mail acknowledgement and/or phone call to CCB or AWG members may be required ˇ Implement resolution ˇ Submit a formal RFC documenting the change at the first CCB or AWG meeting following implementation ˇ Since the change may include changes to both the IT Infrastructure and documentation, the RFC should be accompanied by the appropriate SDLC documentation to complete the change and to identify any remaining tasks ˇ The CCB and/or AWG as appropriate review(s) the RFC at the next scheduled meeting(s) to determine if the change should remain as implemented or if a more permanent solution should be considered

CONFIGURATION STATUS ACCOUNTING

The purpose of Configuration Status Accounting (CSA) is to maintain a continuous record of the status of all baselined items. This record is a useful management tool for monitoring changes to CIs, proactively investigating potential baseline anomalies and ensuring all tasks related to making approved changes are proceeding as anticipated. To ensure that CI and document status can be determined at any time, the CM Manager maintains the CIL, which is a list of controlled CIs and their lower level components. The CM status accounting process ensures that the CM actions are recorded in sufficient detail, the content and status of each CI is known, and previous versions can be recovered. A complete historical record of all information regarding changes to the CIs shall be maintained and used in the preparation of records and reports. The CM Manager prepares summary and detailed reports as required. These reports document the status of CIs, associated RFCs and defects reports, including the disposition of action items resulting from RFCs and defect reports, and the current status of baselines. The CM Manager generates and reports the status to the OCIO representatives, project leads and the TTB user community to track the status of their RFCs. Status reports are generated and distributed biweekly. Ad hoc reports can be generated by the CM manager upon request by an E-CCB member or by a PM. The CM Manager generates CSA Reports with details such as: ˇ CI Name ˇ Project Name ˇ Owner ˇ Version Number ˇ File Type ˇ Status of Latest Version The CM Manager also collects and reports metrics such as: ˇ # RFCs open ˇ # RFCs closed ˇ # RFCs by priority ˇ # RFCs by project ˇ #RFCs on hold

CONFIGURATION AUDITS

Configuration audits are performed on a periodic basis to ensure that the physical baseline (hardware, software, etc.) conforms to the documented baseline and that the CM processes are being followed by the projects. The results of these audits are documented and any action items are recorded and tracked to closure. The E-CCB is the authority for scheduling and overseeing of the configuration audits. An enterprise wide configuration audit will be conducted annually by the CMO to ensure that physical baselines conform to the documented CI baselines. There are two types of configuration audits used to assess individual project's compliance with CM processes and standards described in this plan. These are release audits and library audits. Both audits are conducted to ensure required CIs are present and appropriately controlled. A CM audit checklist will be prepared and used for each type of audit. ˇ A release audit is performed before each system build and or new process rollout to ensure implementation integrity. The release audit checklist and the checklist instructions are used for this process. In general, the release audit is performed by whoever builds the application ˇ A library audit is performed to verify the completeness and accuracy of the library's contents, and to review the structure and facilities of the process asset library. A library audit includes assets in the physical library as well. The library audit checklist and the library audit checklist instructions support this process. The CM Manager performs Library Audits every time a system is baselined

The CM Manager will document issues encountered during the CM audit, and will report those items to the project manager and team with recommendations for corrective action. These discrepancies will be tracked and managed to completion in the project's action item log and project schedule. Any action that is not resolved in a timely manner will then be escalated to the Project Manager. If not resolved at the project level, the risk or issue will be documented and presented to E-CCB for consideration and corrective action.

The Bureau of the Public Debt is conducting a proposal evaluation for subject solicitation.  The point of contact listed in the attached
questionnaire has identified your office as a source to evaluate the contractor’s past performance and it also authorizes release of this
information to our office.

The individual most knowledgeable of the contractor’s day-to-day operations and overall condition of performance rendered should complete the
survey.  However, that individual is encouraged to supplement their own knowledge with the judgment of others in their organization, if
appropriate.

Please complete the questionnaire as thoroughly as possible by indicating your ratings and providing comments wherever applicable.  For any
rating of P or U, we request you provide an explanatory narrative and attach to your response.  The narratives need not be lengthy, but should
be detailed and descriptive.  Use separate evaluation forms for each contract/order being evaluated.

Your time and effort in providing this information is greatly appreciated.  The requested information is critical to our evaluation.  Please
complete and return the completed package as quickly as possible, but not later than 2:00 PM ET on April 17, 2009.  You may e-mail a scanned

                                                          Quality of Product or Service


                                                                 Rating Guideline


    When responding to the descriptive statements, select the letter (U, P, F, G, E, O, NA), which most accurately describes the contractor’s
                                                            performance or situation.
|Unsatisfactory     |Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of your organization’s resources.  |
|                   |Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in       |
|                   |consideration for future awards containing similar requirements.                                                           |
|Poor               |Overall compliance requires significant resources from your organization to ensure achievement of contract requirements.   |
|Fair               |Overall compliance requires minor resources from your organization to ensure achievement of contract requirements.         |
|Good               |There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements.                     |
|Excellent          |There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has exceeded the contract performance requirements without incurring       |
|                   |additional costs.                                                                                                          |
|Outstanding        |The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated           |
|                   |achievements and is commendable as an example for others. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare       |
|                   |circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".                |
|Not Applicable     |The contractor was not required to perform or this was not covered under this contract.                                    |


|I.     |QUALITY of PRODUCT OR SERVICE:                                                |O              |E        |G        |F                  |P         |
|       |Please explain:                                                               |                                                                  |
