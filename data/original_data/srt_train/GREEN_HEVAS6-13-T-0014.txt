7.0   CONTRACTOR TRAVEL
      Contractor costs for Government authorized travel are included in this contract.  All travel shall be in accordance with FAR 31.205-46 and
      applicable travel regulations (Joint, Federal or Standardized).  Contractor payment claims shall include applicable documentation to
      support actual costs incurred (e.g. airfare and hotel/lodging receipts) as well as any receipts valued at or above $75.00.  Failure to
      provide appropriate documentation may result in loss of reimbursement of travel expenses.

8.0   SECURITY
      Contractor(s) shall be escorted by an authorized DoDEA employee if access to facilities is required by contact.  If unescorted access is
      required, a satisfactory Federal and/or State criminal background check must first be performed by DoDEA, through the Office of Personnel
      Management, on each identified contract employee prior to unsupervised contact or unescorted facility access being granted.
