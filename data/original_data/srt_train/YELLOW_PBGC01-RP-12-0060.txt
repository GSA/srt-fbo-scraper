Requirements Below are PBGC's requirements of the contractor with regard to the services and deliverables for this contract. All of the activities and deliverables listed below will be completed with adherence to sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 of this statement of objectives. Reference section 1.5 Deliverables for a detailed listing of all the required documents for which the contractor will be required to submit.

1.4.1 A holistic approach to Risk Management The contractor will develop a Risk Management Program at the system information level (tier 3) based upon the Risk Management Framework (RMF) as outlined in the current version of NIST SP 800-37. This Risk Management Program will be based upon a

Page 4 of 10

PAGE 12 OF 60 PBGC01-RP-12-0025

methodology that will ensure program compliance and use of PBGC's EISO and/or industry best practices to support the most effective and efficient use of resources. It is expected that the Risk Management Program for this tier 3 effort will tie to and directly support PBGC's Enterprise Risk Management Program. Furthermore, the Risk Management program will integrate with system development life cycle (specifically PBGC's ITSLCM, see section 1.3.2.2).

1.4.2 Security Assessment and Authorization (SA&A) The contractor will serve as project manager over the Security Assessment and Authorization (SA&A) process and complete system security tests and evaluations. This will include review of the PA's self assessment of security controls. The contractor will conduct comprehensive evaluations of the security controls and other safeguards to determine and document the extent to which the design and implementation meet NIST and PBGC's EISO requirements. The contractor will support security authorization of the PA's program systems by: reviewing and evaluating system categorization; documenting and maintaining the PA program's System Security Plan (SSP) and related control matrix; and developing Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA), and other PBGC specified EISO required documentation. The contractor will develop project schedules and serve as project manager for those activities needed for on-going authorization as outlined in NIST SP 800-37 process and PBGC's EISO standards. The contractor will be responsible for responding to emergent information system security authorization and security requirements from U.S. Federal Government and PBGC.

1.4.3 Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) Program The Contractor will centrally manage the tier three level Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) program 1 so that all necessary activities as required by NIST SP 800137 are planned and managed in a pro-active coordinated manner. The contractor will support the establishment of the ISCM Strategy by: planning, selecting the security controls with associated tasks, which "provides security status information for all tiers and real-time updates for ongoing system authorization decisions" (NIST SP 800-137, p. 20). The contractor will perform risk assessments regarding changes to the PA system's environment or impact due to PBGC's changing environment, including Business Impact/Risk Assessment (BIA/RA) recommendations based on both security and business considerations, in coordination with PBGC's EISO and the PA.
1

See NIST SP 800-137 (rev. 1), Chapter 3, which outlines the process for developing and implementing an ISCM program.

Page 5 of 10

PAGE 13 OF 60 PBGC01-RP-12-0025

The contractor will then establish the ISCM Program by: developing a continuous monitoring plan that includes automated workflows to support efficient and effective process, and create a program schedule. The contractor will identify metrics for each control, establish monitoring and assessment frequencies, and develop the ISCM architecture that will be used to support information collection and delivery.

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-"Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. "Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. "Registered in the CCR database" means that-(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror`s name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.
PAGE 30 OF 60 PBGC01-RP-12-0025

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number-(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror the a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government`s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day`s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor`s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) |_| Are, |_| are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) |_| Have, |_| have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) |_| Are, |_| are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) |_| Have, |_| have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ##6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ##6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ##6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ##362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
