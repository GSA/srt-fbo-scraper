EVENT PLAN:
Function               Description

General/Plenary        Conference Center, convention center, or hotel facility is needed to
Session                      accommodate 500 attendees with a general/plenary session room.  Room should accommodate 500 attendees in either
                 classroom style, half rounds, crescent style, or theater/auditorium seating with chairs that have writing tables (that can be
                 raised and lowered for note taking.) We prefer that no attendee has their back to the presenters (front of the room).  Isle(s)
                 and several entrances and exits are needed for easy flow of traffic. General/plenary room should have a stage area with risers,
                 pipe and drape, podium, lighting, and audio visual equipment and services (based on the requirements of the presenters – to be
                 determined later.)
                             Adequate bathroom facilities to accommodate 500 attendees, in close proximity to general/plenary session room, are
                 required. Tentative draft agenda for the seminar includes using the general/plenary room from approximately 7:00 am – 5:00 pm
                 for each day of the seminar.  Room is to be setup prior to attendees’ arrival at 7:45 am.

Breakout Rooms         OPM-FIS’ tentative draft agenda requires ten breakout rooms accommodating 50 attendees.  However, there may be a need for
                 one or two of the rooms that can accommodate 100 attendees for double sessions (rooms with movable walls if double rooms are
                 needed for breakouts.)  Room set up should be classroom style so the attendees are able to take notes.  Attendees’ view of the
                 presenter should not be obstructed.  Audio visual equipment and services are needed for each breakout room based on the
                 requirements of the presenter (to be determined at a later time).  Adequate bathroom facilities to accommodate 500 attendees, in
                 close proximity to breakout rooms, are required for timely session changes.
                             Tentative draft agenda for the seminar includes using the breakout rooms for each day of the seminar.

Registration Area            Space shall be available for initial and straggler registration for the seminar.  A registration alcove shall be
                 provided or adequate tables and chairs in a lobby area (to accommodate approximately five alphabetical rows breakdown).  Ease of
                 traffic flow is important and proximity to general/plenary session room.  If tables are provided, they will need to be covered
                 and draped.

Office Area            Locked office space for OPM-FIS seminar staff shall be provided
       And                   with table and chairs.  Locked storage space shall be provided to
Storage Area                 accommodate seminar giveaways, presentation materials, and laptop computers.  Office space and storage space can be
                 combined into one room with space large enough for both requirements.


Guest Rooms      Approximately one-third (150) of our attendees will need hotel guest rooms at the prevailing Federal per diem rate.  Attendees
                 will be responsible for payment of their hotel guest room, tax, incidental charges, and any other charges not authorized by OPM-
                 FIS to be billed to the Master Account.  The majority of attendees will arrive the day before the seminar and depart on the day
                 after the seminar; however, some may depart on the evening of the last day of the seminar.

Guest Rooms      All reservations will be made through the Hotel’s reservation department by
  (continued)                calling a specified telephone number(s) or by setting up a link to the Hotel’s reservation department.  IT
