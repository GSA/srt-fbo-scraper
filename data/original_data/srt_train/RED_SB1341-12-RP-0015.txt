Kinetic parameters of the cyclization and decyclization reactions of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing radicals

Reason: Liquid phase kinetics. Experimental data on liquid phase radical cyclization and decyclization reactions were analyzed within the framework of the intersecting parabolas model. No new kinetic data on individual reactions are presented. Empirical relationships between kinetic parameters and the differences in electronegativity of the atoms participating in the reaction were derived.

J. Phys. Chem. A:

Polar Effects Control Hydrogen-Abstraction Reactions of Charged, Substituted Phenyl Radicals

Reason: Ion-molecules reactions studied in ICR MS. This database is limited to reactions of neutral (non-ion) species. III. Description of bugs or errors discovered in the data entry system and database. - Reactions with large numbers of products cannot be entered. The data entry system does not report any errors but does not confirm a successful entry either. Examination of the resultant record in the internal database through the web interface does not show the corresponding record. Affected record: SQUIB = 2001CHA/MUL1302-1314. - Article # 8 (SQUIB = 2004AND/HUA11537-11544):Kinetic isotope effects could not be entered for most compounds because they are close to unity and get rounded off in the web data display (e.g., k/k = 1.01 instead of 1.00857). - Bibliographic data from J.

CHAPTER 2.B CONTENTS 2.B CONFORMANCE

Previous sections in this chapter define the rules and conventions for constructing and communicating a message including the parts of a message structure. Messages that adhere to those rules of a specific version of a standard are compliant to that version of the standard. Compliance to the HL7 Standard has historically been impossible to define and measure in a meaningful way. To compensate for this shortcoming, vendors and sites have used various methods of specifying boundary conditions such as optionality and cardinality. Frequently, specifications have given little guidance beyond the often-indefinite constraints provided in the HL7 Standard. This section presents the methodology for producing a precise and unambiguous specification of a single interaction called a message profile. Messages that adhere to the constraints of a message profile are said to be conformant to the profile. For conformance to be measurable, the message profile must specify the following types of information: What data will be passed in a message. The format in which the data will be passed. The acknowledgement responsibilities of the sender and receiver. A conformance statement is a claim that the behavior of an application or application module agrees with the constraints stated in one or more message profiles. This section defines the message profile; however, the conformance statement will not be discussed further in this document. An implementation guide is often created to organize a collection of message profiles for specifying a set of related HL7 V2.x interactions described in a use case. Implementation guides typically describe broader conformance requirements such as application behavior. Such requirements may include how a set of messages are to be used to inact a certain application functionality. Implementation guides have broad scope have been introduced in this

section to provide context of message profiles and will not be discussed further in this document. A message profile provides a mechanism for specifying a single message definition. Definition: An HL7 message profile is an unambiguous specification of one standard HL7 message that have been
analyzed for a particular interaction. It prescribes a set of precise constraints upon one standard HL7 message.

An HL7 message profile is compliant, in all aspects, with the HL7 defined message(s) used in the profile. It may specify constraints on the standard HL7 message definition. A message profile fully describes a conversation between two or more systems through the combination of the following: a) one interaction analysis,

b) one or more dynamic definitions, c) one static definition, and

d) one table (vocabulary) definition. The interaction analysis may be documented as a sequence diagram (supported with text) or just a textual description (See section 2.B.2, "Interaction Definition".) The dynamic definition is an interaction specification for a conversation between 2 or more systems (See Section.2.B.3, "Dynamic definitionDynamic definition".) The static definition is a specification that defines the constraints for a single message structure (see Section 2.B.4, "Static definitionStatic definition"). The table (vocabulary) definition is a specification of the tables referenced in the static definition. (see Section 2.B.5, "Table definitionTable definition"). The message profile is normatively expressed as an XML document validated against the normative message profile Schema, it may be registered on the HL7 web site (see Section 2.B.10, "Message profile documentMessage profile document"). The normative table definition can partly or wholly be contained in the message profile XML document. The table definition can also be partly or wholly defined in a table library. The table library is normatively expressed as an XML document validated against the normative table library Schema, it may be registered on the HL7 web site; (see SectionX.X.X, "Message profile documentMessage profile document"). For detailed background information regarding message profiles, the reader is referred to the Implementation/Conformance Work Group balloted informative document, "Message Profiling Specification, Version 2.2", published November 30, 2000, upon which this section is based. This document is available from the HL7 Resources Web site (http://www.hl7.org). A sample message profile is shown on the next page to assist in illustrating the constituents of a message profile and how they work together.

Message profile publish/subscribe topics The message profile publish/subscribe topics is not required to be unique but might be used by publish/subscribe systems to convey aspects of the message profile (see MSH-21 Message Profile Identifier in the opening section of chapter 2). The topics are not a normative constituent of the message profile but, if provided as part of the metadata, should be in the format described below. The topic elements will be separated by the dash (-). Any element that does not have a value should use null. As this information may be used in a message instance; it should not contain any HL7 message delimiters. Message Profile Publish/Subscribe Topics Elements

Static definition
Definition: The static definition is an exhaustive specification for a single message. Normatively expressed in XML, it may be registered on the HL7 web site (See Section 2.B.10, "Message profile documentMessage profile document"). The static definition is based on a message structure defined in the HL7 Standard. The message code, trigger event, event description, role (Sender or Receiver) and, if applicable, the order control code will be provided. A complete static definition shall be defined at the message, segment, and field levels. A static definition is compliant in all aspects with the HL7-defined message it profiles. However, the static definition may define additional constraints on the standard HL7 message. A static definition identifies only those specific elements of a standard HL7 message that are used in the exchange. A static definition explicitly defines: a) Segments, segment groups, fields and components usage rules
Formatted: Hyperlink Text, Check spelling and grammar

b) Cardinalities c) Length information

d) Value sets and coding systems. The following figure depicts, in a graphical way, the concept that the static definition is an overlay of the HL7 message structure further constraining it. For example, where the HL7 message structure shows unlimited number of NK1 Segments, the static definition allows for only three repetitions. Additionally, fields that are optional in the HL7 message structure may be required within the HL7 static definitions.

2.B.4.1 Static definition identifier

...

Each static definition must have a unique identifier when registered (See section 2.B.10, "Message profile documentMessage profile document"). An authority other than the registry may define this identifier. If, at the time of registration, the static profile does not have an identifier assigned by the submitter's authority, the registry authority will assign one. The static definition identifier would be the identifier used if a system asserts a strict conformance claim (see MSH-21 Message Profile Identifier in the first section of chapter 2). 2.B.4.2 Static definition publish/subscribe topics Static definition publish/subscribe topics convey the static definition aspects of the message profile. These topics may be used by publish/subscribe systems (see MSH-21 Message Profile Identifier in the first section of chapter 2). The topics are not a normative constituent of the message profile but, if provided as part of the metadata (see section 2.B.10, "Message profile documentMessage profile document"), should be in the format described below. The topic elements will be separated by the dash (-). Any element that does not have a value should be null (nothing between the dashes). As this information may be used in a message instance, it should not contain any HL7 message delimiters.

Formatted: Hyperlink Text, Check spelling and grammar

Comment [RDS1]: Now that we clarified that a message profile is not a collection of "message profiles" should we remove the static identifier and use the message profile identifier only. That is, now that there is a true 1-to-1 relantionship is there a need for the static ID now? FO: yes. Formatted: Hyperlink Text, Check spelling and grammar

2.B.5

Table definition
The table definition (or vocabulary) is a specification of a collection of tables used to constrain coded message element content. The table definition is an independent specification that can be embedded in a message profile or referenced by one or more message profiles. Each table definition consists of meta data and code/description pairs. A coded message element is associated with a table in the static definition with the table attribute for fields, components, and sub-components. Elements that use coded data types (e.g., CNE, CWE, etc.) are also associated with a table. For the latter, the message includes the code, drawn from HL7 0396, that uniquely defines the table resp. coding system, as well as the coded value itself.

2.B.5.0

Table Library The table definition defines a vocabulary that can be bound to a message profile. The table library specifies a standardized format to organize the vocabulary and provides support to reference it (See section X.X.X). In short, the table library is a container for a collection of tables. Note that the table definition may also be embedded in the XML message profile. A table library is organized as follows: 1) Table library meta data 2) Collection of tables and their values The table library supports references to tables and instances of tables.

Comment [FO2]: this is problematic: Table 0396 identifies coding systems like ICD10, but the v2 tables are not codesystems. This part of the current work.

2.B.5.0.2

Table Definition A table definition consists of metadata describing the table and specifies a list of code/value pairs. The table definition metadata consists of a table identifier, OID, name, type, version, and code system. Table elements express code/description pairs. Table XXX gives a summary of each table definition attribute along with an example. The table type is a recognized HL7 table as described in section 2.6.3.6. Valid identifiers for a table type are HL7, User, Local, External, and Imported.
Table Attribute Identifier OID Name Type Version Code System The table identifier An OID that identify the table, not the codesystem A descriptive name of the table The type of the table as described in section 2.6.3.6 The version of the table A code system as specified in the HL7 table 0396 Definition 0001 2.16.840.1.113883.12.1 Administrative Sex HL7 1.0 2.5.1 Example

A table element consists of a code, display name (value), and source . Table XXX gives a summary of each table element attribute along with an example. Valid identifiers for the table element source are HL7, Local, Redefined, or Standard Development Organization (SDO). Redefined means the code/display name has been changed from its original value.
Element Attribute Code Display Name Source Definition The code for the data value The long description of the code The source of the code/value pair M Make HL7 Example

2.B.5.2

Conformance Requirements

The content of a table definition is used to express conformance requirements of coded message elements defined in a message profile. If the content of a message element matches that of a table element defined in the table definition identified with the Table attribute, the content of the message element is said to be conformant with respect to the message profile. If the content of a message element does not match a table element defined in the table definition identified with the Table attribute, the content of the message element is said to be non-conformant with respect to the message profile. .

2.B.6

Profile type
There are three basic profile types used in documenting standard conformance: a) HL7 Standard profile (represents a specific HL7 published standard, creation and publication limited to HL7 use),

b) constrainable profile (with Optional elements which must be further constrained in order to
Health Level Seven, Version 2.82.8 Š20112011. All rights reserved. Membership BallotMembership Ballot Page 2-215 SeptemberSeptember 20112011

Chapter 2: Control ­ Conformance

create implementation profiles), and c) implementation profile (no Optional parts, fully implementable).

This model allows vendors, SDOs, PEOs or providers to publish generic profiles from which fully constrained implementation profiles can be created. In comparison with the HL7 standard, separate constrainable and implementation profiles may exist for the receiving and the sending role. Both constrainable profiles and implementation profiles focus primarily on the expectations of the sending application, with fewer constraints on the application behavior of the receiver. 2.B.6.1 Vendor constrainable profiles A vendor might develop a message profile to which all their software products must comply but, in itself, is not an implementation profile. The different products serve potentially different domains and might be implemented with products from other vendors. The vendor profile constrains the HL7 Standard by defining agreed-to vocabularies, conditionality rules, supported items, and local extensions that are shared across all products. The profile is not necessarily fully constrained. For example, the vendor profile might allow the usage code of optional as, across different products, an element may be required in some use cases, be optional or conditional in others, and not be supported at all in still others. Furthermore, at this level, providing exact length definition is optional as well. The vendor's individual software products might themselves have profiles that would build on, and further constrain, their vendor profile. The product profile would specifically define the information model and the elements contained within. The product profile might still be a constrainable profile as elements might result in different HL7 messages based on configuration settings and customizations. Only once all configuration settings and customizations have been taken into account can you have a fully-constrained 'Implementation' profile. Constrainable profiles can be useful for interface engine applications which must be flexible enough to allow for receipt of messages based on a variety of message profiles. The desire of the application would be to validate message instances against one constrainable profile. 2.B.6.2 Realm constrainable profiles Realms, national and regional, profiles represent localization and restrictions placed on the appropriate standard, while providing enough optionality for basing the more specific implementation profiles. Some examples of realm constrainable profiles are: a) AS4700.1-2001 Implementation of HL7 v2.3.1 Part 1:Patient Administration (constrainable profile for Australian Standards, constrains HL7 2.3.1, Chapter 3).
Comment [FO4]: we should remove this paragraph

b) AS/NZS 4700.3-1999 Implementation of HL7 v2.3 Part 3: Electronic messages for exchange of information on Drug Prescription (constrainable profile for Australian Standards, constrains HL7 2.3, various Chapters). 2.B.6.3 Implementation profiles Implementation profiles represent the lowest level of specification required for unambiguous implementation.

Static definition concepts
This section discusses concepts common to each level of the static definition (message, segment and field). It uses the generic term 'element' to refer to segment groups, segments, fields, components and subcomponents.

2.B.7.1

Length An unambiguous definition of length requires a clear understanding of what it applies to and how it is measured. Length is defined to be a constraint on the number of characters that may be present in one occurrence of a message element. This definition satisfies both requirements; it applies (strictly) to an element's data value--i.e., the set of characters present in the message representing a value of the element's predefined data type--and it is measured in characters as defined by the rules in chapter 2. The definition is system independent. For example, a system that encodes characters using one byte and a system that uses two-byte encoding would use the same value for length to impose the same length constraint. Length does not count the HL7 characters used to represent the value, only the number of characters in the value itself is counted. If the null character is represented by transmitting "", length conforms to any minimum and maximum length specification. Length shall be interpreted as a restriction on an element's data value, not on the presence or absence of the element. A length value of zero is appropriate when the null character is transmitted, but this does not imply the element is not present; clearly two characters will be present if null is transmitted. Restricting the applicability of length to data values present in the message is necessary. Not only does it keep the concept simple and eliminate the need to address special cases, it also allows for the transmission of null values for required elements. A required element can have a null value, since this still clearly means there is a data value encoded for the element in the message. If an element is empty or not present in the message, i.e., there is no data value encoded for the element in the message, then length restrictions do not apply since there is nothing to restrict and no length constraint that can be violated. Length shall be specified using the following syntax: "m..n", where m and n are non-negative integers designating the minimum and maximum number of characters the element may have, respectively, where n m. When an upper bound for length cannot be determined in advance, the use of the asterisk character, "*", may be used as a place holder for the maximum value, so that, in addition, to the above syntax, where m and n are integer values, a constraint of the form "m..*" may be used to indicate the maximum length constraint is unknown. Example length constraints are shown in the Minimum and Maximum Length Examples table. Minimum and Maximum Length Examples
Value Description For constrainable profile: no length defined, i.e. no requirements on the length are given. Leaving this information empty is not allowed for implementable profiles. 0..0 1..1 1..n n..n 1..* n..* For withdrawn elements: minimum and maximum set to 0. Element must have exactly one character Element may have up to n characters Element must have exactly n characters Element may have any length.

Description Element must have a minimum length of m and a maximum length of n where m is less than or equal to n and m is greater than or equal to 1.

Comment

Note: Whether or not an element is populated is controlled by cardinality. But if the element is populated with a non null value, the minimum and maximum length definition must hold. The null information representation (two double quotes) is not considered to be a value with applicable length information. Length should not be specified for composite elements. In these cases, the actual minimum and maximum lengths can be very difficult to determine due to the interdependencies on the component content, and the specification of actual lengths is not useful either. For example, if an overall length of 4..20 is assigned to a data element with a type CWE, what does this mean in practice? However if a length is specified, the vertical bar representation of the data must conform to the stated length, allowing for an additional character for each HL7 separator character. 2.B.7.2 Conformance Length Constrainable profile specifications may also specify a conformance length. This is the number of characters that any conformant application must be able to correctly handle. For example, a constrainable profile may declare that the minimum and maximum lengths of a specific field are 3 and 2500. An implementation profile may further constrain this length to specify what is actually supported by an application. However an application could declare a length of 3..4, which may not be useful within the context of the constrainable profile. A constrainable profile may specify conformance lengths to establish a minimum expectation. In the example case, if the constrainable profile specifies a conformance length of 200, no other profile may assert conformance to the constrainable profile unless its maximum length is 200 or greater. Conformance length is a redundant concept in implementation profiles that will not be further constrained, and should not be specified. 2.B.7.3 Truncation Flag As of 2.7, a truncation pattern is defined which can be used to assist applications to manage the existence of data that exceeds the maximum number of characters that can be properly handled. The truncation pattern is described in Chapter 2, section 2.5.5.2, "Truncation Pattern". Note that the actual truncation behavior of the pattern is data type dependent. Applications shall not use truncation if the profile prohibits it. Applications may support truncation if the profile permits it. Message Profiles may specify the truncation behaviour. The truncation flag is a simple boolean. In a constrainable profile, the value may be true or false. False signifies that the element may not be truncated, while true means that the value may be truncated. If a profile fixes truncation to false, no other further constraining profile may mark this value as true. If the value is fixed to true, other further constraining profiles may mark it as true or false. In an implementation profile, a value of true for the truncation flag signifies that the application supports the defined truncation behaviour for the appropriate type. A value of false indicates that the application does not support data truncation for this element. Although the truncation pattern was only defined in v2.7, the bahaviour may be adopted for previous versions of HL7, and the truncation flag may be used with previous version. Note that in these cases, the truncation character cannot be specified in the message, and some other arrangement must exist. 2.B.7.4 Cardinality In order to separate message content requirements from application behavior requirements, cardinality is used to control message content, and usage is used to define application requirements. Cardinality controls the number of occurrences of an element appearing in a message. Some elements shall always be present (e.g., cardinality [1..1], [1..n]). Others shall never be present (i.e., cardinality [0..0]). Others may be optional with zero or more occurrences (e.g., cardinality [0..n]). Cardinality identifies the minimum and maximum number of occurrences that a message element must have in a conformant message. Cardinalities

Comment [FO5]: in which way? We haven't specified this, or did we?

Comment [RDS6]: Does this mean the total character without regard to the min/max? If so, how is this specified--is this in the schema? FO: to my understanding, you either specify a conformance length OR min/max. It does not make sense to have both. AND: It is just a guidance. Or is it a real requirement to have a maximum length being greater thatn that? Comment [RDS7]: Need to confirm this attribute is in the message profile schema.

Chapter 2: Control ­ Conformance

are expressed as a minimum-maximum pair of non-negative integers. A conformant message must always contain at least the minimum number of occurrences, and shall not contain more than the maximum number of occurrences. An explicit cardinality range is required for segment group, segment, and field elements. Component and sub-component elements do not explicitly include a cardinality range, but a cardinality range is implicitly associated with each component and sub-component element. The associated cardinality depends on the element's usage code. For components and sub-components with a usage code of R, the associated cardinality range is [1..1]; for all elements with a usage code of RE, C, CE, or O, the associated cardinality is [0..1]; and for all elements with an X usage code, the associated cardinality is [0..0]. There are two special values for cardinality. If the minimum number of occurrences is 0, the element may be omitted from a message. In certain circumstances, the maximum number of occurrences may have no specified limit. In this case, it is identified with "*" (e.g., [n..*]). Valid cardinality values are shown in the Cardinality table; combinations not designated in the table are invalid. In particular usage code RE is not allowed with cardinalities [1..1], [1..n], and [1..*]. Cardinality [m..n], where m is greater than 1, is allowed with usage codes R and RE. If an element with this cardinality range has a usage code RE, the element may be omitted from the message but if present, it must have at least m occurrences and may not have more than n occurrences.

Usage Message content is governed by the cardinality specification associated (explicitly or implicitly) with each element of an HL7 message. Usage rules govern the expected behavior of the sending application and receiving application with respect to the element. The usage codes expand/clarify the optionality codes defined in the HL7 standard. Usage codes are employed in a message profile to constrain the use of elements defined in the standard. The usage code definitions are given from a sender and receiver perspective and specify operational and implementaiton requirements. The standard allows broad flexibility for the message structures that HL7 applications must be able to receive without failing. But while the standard allows that messages may be missing data elements or may contain extra data elements, it should not be inferred from this requirement that such messages are

Comment [RDS8]: {This is Frank's Comment}I am not sure whether we can and should rename this section and all related stuff!? I do not like the destinction between optionality and usage. Comment [RDS9]: {This is Frank's comment} For me, both are identical in the end. The only difference is the use: optionality is used in the standard, usage in derived profiles. In principle there is no need to have both! I rather recommend to use one for both. The inclusion of RE in the standard is an indication therefore.

There are multiple interpretations of RE when a value is known. One is the capability must always be supported and a value is sent if known, the other is the capability must always be supported and a value may or may not b e sent even when known based on a condition external to the profile specification. The condition may be noted in the profile but cannot be processed automatically. This is what can be interpreted from the relevant part of the definition. Regardless of the interpretation the RE usage code, a set of test circumstances can be developed to sufficiently test the RE element.

2.B.7.7

Relationship between usage and cardinality Cardinality governs the appearance of a field, and usage governs the expected behavior of applications. Nevertheless, a relationship exists between them that must be maintained. The valid combinations of the two are defined in the Cardinality table. For purposes of message profiles, selected cardinality and usage combinations are examined here. The constraints on allowed combinations are: a) If the usage of an element is Required (R), the minimum cardinality for the element shall always be greater than or equal to 1.

b) If the usage of an element is not Required (R) (i.e., any code other than 'R'), the minimum cardinality shall be 0 except in the following condition: c) If the profile author wishes to express a circumstance where an element will not always be present, but when present must have a minimum number of repetitions greater than one, this may be

This is an optionality added with 2.7. The meaning is slightly different from the message profile usage code of RE. Page 2-222 Health Level Seven, Version 2.82.8 Š 20112011. All rights reserved. SeptemberSeptember 20112011 Membership BallotMembership Ballot.

Chapter 2: Control ­ Conformance

indicated by specifying the non-required Usage code with the minimum cardinality representing the minimum number of repetitions when the element is present. This is accomplished, as in UML, with an expression of the form as (m..n), indicating that permitted occurrences are either zero, or the range of m through n. Example combinations: Example Usage-Cardinality Combinations
Cardinality [1..1] [1..5] [0..1] [0..5] [3..5] Usage R R RE C RE Interpretation There will always be exactly 1 occurrence present. There will be between 1 and 5 occurrences present. The element must be supported, but may not always be present. If the condition predicate is true, there will be between 1 and 5 occurrences. If the condition predicate is false, there will be 0 occurrences. If any values for the element are sent, there must be at least 3 and no more than 5 occurrences. However, the element may be absent (0 occurrences).

2.B.7.8

Usage within hierarchical elements As part of the conformance framework, there is an additional rule for determining whether a particular 'element' is present. The rule is as follows: For an element to be considered present, it must have content. This means that simple elements (fields, components or sub-components with simple data types such as NM, ST, ID) must have at least one character. Complex elements (those composed of other elements, e.g., Messages, Segment Groups, Segments, Fields with complex data types such as CNE, XPN, etc.), must contain at least one component that is present. Elements that do not meet these conditions are not considered to be present. For example, if a field is made up of 4 required but may be empty components, at least one of the components must be present in order for the field to be considered present. Thus, if the field is profiled as Required, an instance message would only be conformant if the field contained at least one populated component. The reason for this rule is to ensure that the intent of the profile is met. The rule is necessary because the traditional 'vertical bar' encoding allows, for example, for a bare segment identifier with no fields (e.g., a line containing just "NTE|" would be considered valid under the standard rules, but would be considered not present as far as testing against a conformance specification). The XML encoding also allows this, as well as fields without their components, components without their sub-components, etc. (e.g., <PID.3/>).

2.B.7.9

Condition predicate If the usage code of an element is C or CE, then a conditionality predicate must be associated with this element that identifies the conditions under which the element must be or is allowed to be present. The predicate must be testable and based on other values within the message. This predicate may be expressed as a mathematical expression or in text and may utilize operators such as equivalence, logical AND, logical OR and NOT. The conforming sending and receiving applications shall both evaluate the predicate. When the Usage is not 'C' or 'CE', the conditionality predicate will not be valued.

Profiling Multiple Occurrences Individual occurrences of an element can be profiled differently. This mechanism allows for greater flexibility for constraining elements. For example, each occurrence of a patient identifier list can be profiled differently. Prior to HL7 V2.8 individual occurrences of an element had to be profiled the same constraints and often represented a superset of the constraints. To illustrate the utility of profiling individual elements, consider the following example:

Suppose a field has a cardinality of 3. Suppose the field is made up of 4 components and that the first occurrence of the field should always be constrained as indicated: <comp name=comp 1 usage=R/> <comp name=comp 2 usage=R/> <comp name=comp 3 usage=X/> <comp name=comp 4 usage=X/>
Comment [RDS15]: Should follow Camel case notation for schema (ie., uppercase for first letter). Also, spell out comp to make component in schema

Suppose the second occurrence of the field, when present, is constrained in the following way: <comp name=comp 1 usage=R/> <comp name=comp 2 usage=RE/> <comp name=comp 3 usage=RE/> <comp name=comp 4 usage=X/>

And that the third occurrence of the field is as follows: <comp name=comp 1 usage=X/> <comp name=comp 2 usage=X/>

<comp name=comp 3 usage=R/> <comp name=comp 4 usage=R/>

Using the profiling mechanism prior V2.8, it is not possible to constrain the field in the manner indicated. To allow for the 3 occurrences described above, the profile would have to include an element such as the following for constraining the field: <field name=field X min=1 max =3 ...> <comp name=comp 1 usage=RE/> <comp name=comp 2 usage=RE/> <comp name=comp 3 usage=RE/> <comp name=comp 4 usage=RE/> </field>

To allow the profile writer to constrain each occurrence of the field, an occurrence element can be used. Using the occurrence element, the profile would replace the field definition above with the following field definition: <field name=field X min=1 max =3 ...> <occurrence > <comp name=comp 1 usage=R/> <comp name=comp 2 usage=R/> <comp name=comp 3 usage=X/> <comp name=comp 4 usage=X/> </occurrence> <occurrence> <comp name=comp 1 usage=R/> <comp name=comp 2 usage=RE/> <comp name=comp 3 usage=RE/> <comp name=comp 4 usage=X/> </occurrence> <occurrence> <comp name=comp 1 usage=X/> <comp name=comp 2 usage=X/> <comp name=comp 3 usage=R/> <comp name=comp 4 usage=R/> </occurrence> </field>

Chapter 2: Control ­ Conformance

To be clear, it should be noted that the new profile element does not imply any changes to the message encoding; it simply allows for greater control over the individual occurrences of the element than the standard presently allows. There are a number of options that can be used to specify individual occurrences. The order attribute can be specified to indicate if the order of the occurrences is significant. By default, as in the example above if the order is not specified or specified as false then the instance elements can adhere to any of the occurrences specified. If the order attribute is true then order is significant and the instance elements must appear in the order specified. To enable specific occurrences to be constrained without the need to specify an order constraint for every occurrence of the element, the number attribute is optional. The order and number attributes are mutually exclusive. As an example, if it was necessary to tightly constrain the second occurrence but more flexibility was allowed the other occurrences, the profile could specify: <field name=field X min=1 max =3 ...> <occurrence> <comp name=comp 1 usage=RE/> <comp name=comp 2 usage=RE/> <comp name=comp 3 usage=RE/> <comp name=comp 4 usage=RE/> </occurrence> <occurrence number=2> <comp name=comp 1 usage=R/> <comp name=comp 2 usage=R/> <comp name=comp 3 usage=X/> <comp name=comp 4 usage=X/> </occurrence> </field>

An occurrence element without a number attribute would be interpreted as applying to all occurrences of the element not otherwise specified. In other words, in the above case, all components in each occurrence of the field are designated as RE except the second, which must have exactly the first two components present. Occurrence specifications can have any number of number or non-number attributes. The occurrence element can also be specified based on the value of a designated component in the field. The position attribute specifies the component that is evaluated to determine the profiled occurrence. The component that the position attribute references shall always be profiled as required. The value attribute provides the value for determining the profiled occurrence; it is evaluated with the component referenced by the position attribute. For example, the occurrences of field with an XPN datatype can be profiled individually based on the name type code (component 7 in this case).

<field name=field X min=1 max =3 position= 7...> <!--legal name--> <occurrence value=L>

The same logic is also applied to display and birthname occurrences. Not all occurrences need to have a value attribute when using the position/value occurrence profiling option. An occurrence element without a value attribute would be interpreted as applying to all occurrences of the element not otherwise specified.

The position/value occurrence specifications can not be specified with either order or number occurrence specifications. That is, the concepts can not be combined.

2.B.9.8

Components and subcomponents Many fields and components in versions of HL7 prior to 2.5 were defined to be Composite Data (CM) data types. As of 2.5, all field instances will reference a valid data type other than CM. Addenda for versions 2.3.1 and 2.4 are available that define more precise names for the CM data types. These names allow a more precise data type name for each of the fields using the former CM data type to be more easily used for XML encoding of message instances. Although message profiling is not limited to a specific version of HL7, it is strongly encouraged that these new data types be used to increase interoperability between versions. Each component within composite fields shall be profiled. This requires defining the usage, length, data type, and data values of each of the components. Where there are sub-components of a component, each of the sub-components shall also be profiled using the same method. With the exception of cardinality, the rules for these definitions follow those for fields (See section 2.B.9, "Static definition - field levelStatic definition - field level").

2.B.10

Message profile document
HL7 Headquarters will provide a utility, hereafter called registry, on the Members' Only Web site (http://www.hl7.org) where the message profile can be registered. Messages profiles in the registry are all catalogued with a set of metadata. Those entities submitting message profiles into the registry will need to fill out a form that captures the required metadata information. The registry and the metadata will be documented in an informative document and will not be discussed further in this document.9

2.B.10.1

Message profile document format

The Conformance and Guidance for Implementation and Testing (CGIT) Work Group researched the best approach to standardize the format of a message profile to facilitate comparison and measurement. XML (eXtensible Markup Language XML W3C XML 1.0 2nd Ed10) documents appeared to be the best tool for this. This use of XML is not, in any way, related to the HL7 2.xml encoding specification that describes the XML encoding of message instances. The message profile document format provides structure to the documentation of the message profile and does not limit the encoding of an actual message instance. 2.B.10.2 Message profile document definition

A message profile document will be a valid HL7 message profiles if it conforms to the constraints expressed in the message profile document definition (See section 2.B.13. "Conformity Assessment of Usage Codes"), and the additional rules described in this document.

The message profile metadata has changed between V2.5 and V2.6. An attribute to reflect the version of the metadata will be included in the metadata. The registries and tools will need to allow for compatibility between message profile versions. At a minimum, a transform will be available.

dependent on the options supported by the implementation. Given the possibilities for variations in implementation behavior, it is essential that vendors claim conformance to the standard with a clear identification of the optional behavior supported. To emphasize the importance of the above claim and its relationship to the standard the concept of a documentation hierarchy is introduced. 2.B.11.1 Introduction

According to IEEE (glossary 1990) the term semantic interoperability is the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged. The first condition requires that the system is capability of importing information from another system or to export information to another system. Generally testing that systems satistifes this condition is difficult to ascertain and can only be achieved using the actual system that provides or consumes the data. Good documentation though, may serve to ameliorate the problem. One has to be aware, that good documentation is an essential part of all interfaces and that (semantic) interoperability cannot be achieved without sufficient documentation. 2.B.11.2 Problem Space

As mentioned previsouly, testing outside an environment in which applications are deployed is not practical; otherwise tests are based on assumptions which may not be valid. For example, the configuration, the master files, or the software components in use may differ. Users, (e.g., hospitals) may prefer to make preliminary assessments of an application's interoperability capabilities before committing to purchase. To achieve this goal without investing too many resources, vendors and user need to have different choices available to them. 2.B.11.3 Hierarchy of Profiles

First, it is useful to recognize that the standard is a profile and profiles that are derived from it introduce a hierarchy of profiles:

Standard

all options

releasing constraints

non-conformant Constrainable Profiles

Constrainable Profiles

adding constraints

non-conformant Implementable Profiles "non-conformant side" violation border

Implementable Profiles

no options

"conformant side"

Following this hierarachy, profiles can be used by different authorities as explained in the follow illustration:

As shown, there are different options for how profiles can be used. Note 1: The hierarchy of constraintable profiles may contain more than two levels/recursions. Note 2: IHE offers constrainable profiles which are domain specific. They are also based on national addenda like realm-specific Z-segments. From that perspective they form a two level hierarchy alone. 2.B.11.4 Architecture

Therefore, in almost all situations the following component architecture applies. Unfortunately, some of the architectural components are not yet in existence and can therefore be regarded as virtual. Nevertheless, creating them is straightforward.

2.B.11.5

Components

The boxes in the diagram above represent the following components: Documentation Constrainable Profile X X X X X X Implementable Profile Implementation

Components A B C D E F

The standard and an implementation guide based on this standard both repreent a constainable profile, i.e., they provide a set of requirements and constraints, and both still contain optionality. An implementation guide should introduce additional constraints. An implmentaiton guide can either be universal (e.g., published by PEOs like IHE), realm specific (e.g., C32 from HIPSP), or site-specific (hospital chain like Kaiser Peranente in the USA or Rhön in Germany). A vendor--either 1 or 2 in the diagram above--is providing an implementation (C or E) based on that guidance. Usually, these products are accompanied by appropriate documentation (D or F). Based on this notion, these documents should fulfil the requirements for implementation profiles defined in this chapter. 2.B.11.6 Relationships

Hence, a relationship among those components exists. For the purpose of testing semantic interoperability, the following are of importance: Arrow 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Linkage A­ B B­C B­D B­E B­F C­E D­F C­D E­F X X X X X X X X Conformance Compliance X <==+ <==|==+ <==+ | Compatibility

If two documents or profiles are evaluated for consistency we describe them as compliant (0, 2, and 4). If an implementation is tested against some guidance it is called conformant (1, 3, 7, and 8). These two

Chapter 2: Control ­ Conformance

evaluations are conducted on different levels. If a test is done on the same level against the same type (either documents/profiles or implementation) it is called compatibility (5 and 6). 2.B.11.7 Testing Types

The profile architecture diagram above dictates the necessity for different types of testing. The table below provides details of the testing types:
Testing Type Profile Compliance Direction Vertical Test Artifact Profiles Description Profiles are tested against each other to determine whether one is a constraint of (i.e., consistent with) the other. Profile compliance testing is appropriate when additional constraints are specified to successive profiles in the hierarchy (e.g., standard to a constrainable profile to an implementation profile). Provides an assessment of how well the application fulfils the requirements specified in a profile. This is conformance testing. Profiles are tested against each other to determine whether the pair can be used by applications to successfully exchange information (interoperate). If a profile pair that constrains the same underlying profile conflict with each other chances of interoperability of applications that implement these profiles are diminished. Applications are tested with each other to determine whether they can successfully exchange information (interoperate). Applications that implement the same profile or compatible profiles and have successfully passed conformance tests will increase the likelihood of interoperating. IHE connectathons are an example of interoperability testing.

Documentation Quality

The table given below indicates the level of documentation quality for an implemented interface.

A vendor claims conformance to HL7; however the claim is unsubstantiated. Note: This level can be treated as the "standard conformance" as all vendors claim conformance to HL7 per se.

None

A vendor provides evidence of a claim with documentation of the interface. The documentation can be in any format (e.g., a text document) and the contents of the claim are not substantiated. Note: For example, a vendor may copy paragraphs from the original standard; this is an acceptable practice at this level of documentation quality.

Vendor must provide a document.

2 3

The documentation provided fulfils the requirements of a conformance profile as listed in HL7 V2 chapter 2B. The documentation is machine processable. Note: One option is to use the MWB to create this file. But other tools are acceptable as well.

Vendor must provide a conformance statement. The user or vendor has to provide a computable (constrainable) conformance profile file. Vendor must provide a file which fulfils the requirements for implementable conformance profile.

4

The documentation is a conformance profile fulfilling the criteria for implementable profiles, i.e. no options are allowed any more. Note: the criteria listed for level 3 allows a test to verify that the profile fulfils the requirements for implementable profiles.

Perhaps we can use the MWB standard libraries, but those are based on the HL7 database.) Furthermore, the means and details of this testing must be specified. Note: This testing is done against a higher level (=less constraint) profile, probably a constrainable profile issued either by a vendor, As a consequence, it will become affiliate or HQ itself. Therefore, this testing is done vertically and obvious, whether the relationship to checks whether the provided profile only add additional constraints.. the underlying profile is "conformant" or "conflicting". Another option of testing is horizontally. This way, two (implementable) profiles are tested with a sender/receiver perspective. One profile takes the role of the sender, the other of the receiver. It should be tested, whether this will result in interoperabability problems. Note: On this level we talk about "compatible" and "incompatible" profiles. Requires references to the profiles tested against. Furthermore, the role must be mentioned.

The profile is (successfully) tested against another profile.

2.B.11.9

Impacts

A significant advantage of this concept is that it has no impact on implementations because it only addresses documentation. The documentation gives an indication of how close a ve ndor's implementation is conformant to HL7 V2 requirements. The use of tools for creating such documentation becomes necessary at level 3. Furthermore, at the higher levels the documentation should provide a section listing the profiles; this will enable verification. It is recommended that both the documentation and profile be publicly available--prefereably on the vendor's website11. Following the documentation recommendations presented in this chapter will better inform consumers of vendor's products. 2.B.11.10 Primary Focus of Requirement It is recognized that for complex messages satisfying the highest level is challenging. As indicated above, testing profiles using operational implementations is sufficient for satisfying this requirement. A prerequisite is that the documentation reflects the interface behavior. Such verification is only enforceable if such documentation is part of the agreements. It should be noted that we have discussed vendor claims through documentation; this is only a claim of what they implemented. It is not an indication that the vendor's interface implementation is conformant. It is also recognized that we are making the assumption that the documentated profile has been implemented as an interface. When a user buys an interface they should insist that the documentation be included into the agreement. This ensures that sufficient documentation of the interface functionality of the implementation exists. Such documentation and agreements enable testing. Several tools are available to test messages/interfaces against message profile 12.

11

DICOM provides an idea of how this can be done. The official IHE website (http://www.ihe.net/Resources/ihe_integration_statements.cfm) also lists the vendors having participated at the connect-a-thon. Each vendor provides a link to his homepage where the integration statements can be found. It would be ideal, if the vendors could list their conformance statements there in parallel.

12

For example, in the U.S. the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Meaningful Use Tool is used to certify products that conform to the HL7 Version 2.5.1 Implementaiton Guide: Electronic Laboratory Reporting to Public Health and the CDC HL7 Version 2.5.1 Implementation Guide Immunization Messaging.

2.B.11.11 Advantages for Implementers It is advantageous to test interfaces thoroughly; providing good documentation on the capabilitites of the interface facilitates testing and ultimately expedites installation of the interface. A testable profile provides an effective way to check for compatibility problems in advance. Currently, many problems are undected at installation and are discovered by the customer during use. Specific isses like the maximum length of data elements are generally not tested. Inclusion of robust documentation as described here will shift efforts from accidental testing and support difficulties to automated testing with will increase the likelyhood of interoperability.

Tools
The tools used for creation, sharing, re-use, reporting, analyzing, and comparing message profiles are outside the scope of the HL7 standard. Refer to the Conformance and Guidance for Implementation and Testing (CGIT)Work Group web site for useful links that are of widespread interest to, and in support of, message profiles and the (CGIT) Work Group.13

2.B.13

Conformity Assessment of Usage Codes
The preceding sections describe conformance constructs used in message profiles. This section seeks to clarify the meaning of the conformance usage codes by providing a context in which the requirements can be assessed. That is, a conformity assessment value is given for each conformance construct while considering the possible states of data presence and conditional outcomes (if applicable). The result is a set of truth tables that will aid readers interpret the meaning of the conformance constructs. Where applicable the assessment is given for the sending and receiving perspective. The information provided in this section can also serve as a guide when conducting conformance testing.

2.B.13.0 Usage ­ Sending Application The following tables present the truth table for assessing usage codes for sending applications. The following provides an explanation of the heading columns. Usage Indicator ­ Usage declared in the conformance profile for the element. Test Data Provided ­ Indicates whether or not data was provided for this element in the test data set. Conformity Assessment Indicator ­ Indicates the valid action the sender should take when populating the message element. Actual Data Sent ­ Indicates the possible behavior, i.e., whether or not the sender populate the element with a value Conformity Assessment ­ Indicates the result of the conformity assessment. Comments ­ Provides additional insight of the evaluation scenario.

As an example the first entry in the first table can be interpreted as: The sender profile specified the element usage as required (R). Data is available to the sender; therefore the requirement for the sender is to populated the element (i.e., the element shall be present in the message). If the data is present for the element then the application is

There are multiple interpretations of RE when a value is known. One is the capability must a lways be supported and a value is sent if known, the other is the capability must always be supported and a value may or may not be sent even when known based on a c ondition external to the profile specification. The condition may be noted in the profile but cannot be processed automatically. This is what can be interpreted from the relevant part of the definition. Regardless of the interpretation, for the permutations presented here external conditions that may affect a value being sent or not is not considered. Test cases can be developed such that these cases won't exist. For example, a common example of when an element may not be sent is when a patient doesn't authorized it to be sent; in this scen ario a precondition to the test case is that the patient has authorized consent (Another--and preferred--option is to define separate profiles for the different contents.). Therefore, regardless of the interpretation the RE usage code, a set of test circumstances can be developed to sufficiently test the RE element. That is, the external condition can't always prevent an element from being sent; otherwise it is not a condition. Hence, RE elements can in fact be fully tested in the manner described.

Such negative testing is necessary. For example, an application may incorrectly populate an element with a default value. Page 2-240 Health Level Seven, Version 2.82.8 Š 20112011. All rights reserved. SeptemberSeptember 20112011 Membership BallotMembership Ballot.

Optional (O) Usage Conformance Implications
Comment [RDS16]: Constrainable profiles are often developed where many elements are profiled as optional. Such profiles are commonplace and some have been prescribed for meaningful use certification. I think we need to offer some guidance on the conformaity assessment. Although each system will "implicitly" develop an implementation profile it is not practical in large scale testing such as MU to test the variations of each implementaiton.

The usage indicator O-Optional must be further constrained to another value in order to allow for a conformity assessment. Therefore, no truth table is provided. 2.B.13.1 Usage ­ Receiving Application

The following table's present truth table for assessing usage codes for receiving applications. Below provides an explanation of the heading columns. Usage Indicator ­ Usage declared in the conformance profile for the element. Test Data Sent ­ Indicates whether or not the element was populated in the test message. Conformity Assessment Indicator ­ Indicates how the receiver should respond to the test message with regards to an element. Receiver Action ­ Indicates what action the receiver took in response to the test message. Conformity Assessment ­ Indicates the result of the conformity assessment. Comments ­ Provides additional insight of the evaluation scenario. As an example, the first row in the first table can be interpreted as: The receiver profile has specified an element usage as required (R). A test message is created in which the element is populated with a value. The requirement for the receiver is to process the element. If the receiver processed the element then the application is conformant with respect to the element usage. If the application did not process the element then the application is not conformant with respect to the element usage. Conformity Assessment of the Required Usage Code for Receiving Applications

Note: stricter conformance may apply based on business rules associated with the element. For example, the trading partner's conformance agreement included a privacy requirement to not send the patient name for this application. The sender sent the patient name in error. If it is strictly prohibited to send the patient name in this agreement the receiver should reject the message and raise an exception to notify the sender of the error and that the message was not processed. In circumstances where business rules are indifferent for this element the receiver can choose to ignore the data with or without raising an exception. In either case, the receiver shall not process the information. It is important to recognize that for a receiver not-supported element there is no way to distinguish between a strict shall not receive and indifference within the framework of the message profile. Documented business rules are necessary. Such short-comings prevent straight forward analysis and processing.

The notation of (R) and (X) as indicated here represents the equivalent presence indicator as the result of the condition predicate.

NIST and Standards Setting Organizations
ˇ ˇ NIST is a research agency that provides critical data and measurement technologies for use in science and industry NIST is not a standard setting body, but provides reference data for "realizing" standards which are formally adopted by standards setting organizations

The International Temperature Scale (for example) o ITS-90 is realized, maintained and disseminated by NIST to provide a standard scale of temperature and was adopted by the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM) as the official international temperature scale on January 1, 1990 o NIST reference tables of thermocouple electromotive force (emf) vs temperature have been adopted as standards by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International System of Units (SI) American National Standards Institute (ANSI) American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International Organization for Standardization (ISO) International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) International Union for Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) International Commission on Radiation Units & Measurements (ICRU) International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS)

NIST and Metadata Standards
Extensible Markup Language (XML) (and other data exchange formats)
NIST staff are substantially involved (lead roles) in the development of standardized formats for data exchange Atomic and Molecular Data Markup Language (AMDML) Analytical Information Markup Language (AnIML) Thermodynamics Markup Language (ThermoML) Numerical Data Markup Language (UnitsML) Materials Markup Language (MatML) International Chemical Identifier (InChI) Information Technology Standards Cyber and Network Security Biometric Data Interchange Identity Management Cryptographic Tools

Request for Proposal Number SB1341-12-RP-0015 Attachment V, MML Mock Task Order Title: Standard Reference Data Collection, Evaluation, and Archiving

BACKGROUND The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has the primary responsibility in the U.S. Federal Government for providing reliable scientific and technical reference data. NIST's authority for coordinating the compilation, critical evaluation, production, and dissemination of reference data on a national scale is derived from the National Standard Reference Data System (NSRDS) established in 1963 and the Standard Reference Data (SRD) Act of 1968. Through the NSRDS and SRD programs, NIST has coordinated data evaluation centers at NIST, elsewhere in the United States, and internationally. NIST has many scientific and technical data and information centers and would like to improve its collection, evaluation, archiving, and public dissemination of scientific, technical, and engineering data and information in the physical sciences. Guidance regarding this effort can be found in the national roadmap established by the National Science and Technology Council's 2009 report "Harnessing the Power of Digital Data for Science and Society." There are many aspects of the overall effort including various aspects of curation, evaluation, search & discovery, and dissemination. The Material Measurement Laboratory (MML) requires specialized personnel with crosscutting expertise in the various aspects of infrastructure needed for life cycle management of scientific and technical data in digital form including Data Scientists (information technology/computer science), Digital Archivists (information science/library management), and Digital Curators (content/domain knowledge) that are familiar with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and other standards for creation, management, and preservation of electronic records. OBJECTIVES The objectives of this task order are: -To develop a Document Archival Program Plan for the NIST Crystal Structure Database (SRD 3) that can be used as a prototype for other MML databases for creating, managing, and preserving documents in digital format. Refer to http://www.nist.gov/srd/ for more information. -To abstract kinetic data from scientific literature into the NIST Chemical Kinetics Database (SRD 17), and used by Evaluation Panels in the fields of Atmospheric Chemistry and Combustion Chemistry. This requires an exceptionally strong and detailed knowledge of the field of chemical kinetics and computational chemistry. Refer to http://www.nist.gov/srd/ for more information. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS The Contractor shall support NIST MML staff in the identification/collection, migration/transfer, documentation, organization, cataloging/classification, annotation, digitization, archiving, compilation, evaluation, search/discovery, and dissemination of scientific and technical data and information for Standard Reference Data databases and activities. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS Task 1: Abstract Gas Phase Kinetic Data from Scientific Literature and Enter it into the NIST Chemical Kinetics Database 17. The Contractor shall read articles from scientific journals, proceedings, books, and reports in the field of chemical kinetics, abstracting the relevant gas phase numerical data, chemical information, and associated metadata. The Contractor shall enter this data and information into the Government-supplied NIST Chemical Kinetics Database using the database's entry software. Data and information to be entered shall include detailed information on chemical reactions, chemical names, computational methods, uncertainties, and other metadata provided for in the

Request for Proposal Number SB1341-12-RP-0015 Attachment V, MML Mock Task Order database. The Contractor will need a background in chemical kinetics and metadata for this task. Attachment A is an electronic document containing a bibliography of articles that must be abstracted. In addition, this bibliographic information will be uploaded by NIST into the Chemical Kinetics Database. The Contractor shall provide a report that summarizes all data and information entered into the database for each article. The summary report shall also provide a list of any problems encountered with the articles or the database. Attachment B is a sample template for the report. The Contractor shall provide the COR a list of any articles where numerical data and/or metadata could not be abstracted and the reasons for such. This information must also be entered as comments in the database. The Contractor shall provide the COR a list of all molecules that were entered into the database together with their systematic names and/or trivial names, molecular formulas, and structures (hand-drawn and MDL mol files). The Contractor shall provide Chemical Abstract Services Registry Numbers (CASRNs) for each molecule or database identification numbers (where CASRNs are not available). The Contractor shall abstract information from 100-120 articles and provide the summary report (using template provided) every three (3) months for a total of 400-480 articles and four (4) reports throughout the performance of this task order. The exact number of articles abstracted will depend on the number found in the literature in each period. Task 2: Develop a Document Archival Program Plan for Data Evaluation Sheets of the NIST Standard Reference Database SRD 3 Crystal Structure. The Contractor shall develop a Document Archival Program Plan for document conversion (digitization) and curation of data evaluation sheets containing archival information pertaining to the NIST Standard Reference Database SRD 3 Crystal Structure. The Document Archival Program Plan must be based on a requirements analysis of documents consisting of data evaluation sheets in the database center, located at the NIST, Gaithersburg, MD campus. The methods used for assessment and the recommendations contained in the Document Archival Program Plan must be consistent with NARA, OAIS, and other industrystandards for the creation, management, and preservation of electronic records. The data evaluation sheets are contained in folders with formats that vary in size (letter, legal, note), assembly (stapled, paper clipped, loose), and print (typed, handwritten). It is estimated that there are about 45-50 linear feet of material in storage boxes. There are typically about 1800-2400 pages per foot in the boxes, each document often consists of 6-10 pages, and each folder usually contains on the order of 5-15 documents. The Document Archival Program Plan shall include, at a minimum: (a) Identification, assessment, and inventory of the print documents; (b) Production, inventory, cataloging of the digital documents; (c) Quality control of both print and digital documents according to industry best practices in order to ensure the continuity and integrity of the documents and metadata. The Contractor shall conduct a general requirements analysis for the Document Archival Program as determined from a brief one to two workday assessment of the data evaluation sheets contained in storage boxes at NIST Gaithersburg. At least a five (5) percent sample (or per industry standards) of the documents shall be inspected in order to estimate the number of folders and total sheets, identify the distribution of formats and size of the sheets, determine the condition of the documents, provide other evaluations of the collection, and determine the archival needs of NIST for data evaluation sheets.

C. 1 STATEMENT OF WORK

PAGE 10 OF 58

1. BACKGROUND Founded in 1901, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a nonregulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST's mission is to promote United States (U.S.) innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve quality of life. NIST requires Contractor support to fulfill this mission in the Information Technology and Chemical and Materials Science fields. The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland, accelerates, through standards, tests and metrics, the development, deployment and use of secure, usable, interoperable and reliable information systems. ITL enables measurement and testing through research innovations in the areas of computer science and systems engineering. Current focus areas include Health Information Technology (HIT), especially for Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, Smart Grid standards, various Biosciences information technology (IT) applications, Cloud Computing, Voting Systems, Software Assurance, and Computer Forensics. Typically, the work focuses on development of standards, including designing standard use cases and domain modeling, development of systems or reference implementation of a standard using a variety of software languages and database technologies; and development of test software and test material. The Material Measurement Laboratory (MML) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducts studies in measurement science. MML also develops the chemical, biochemical, and chemical engineering measurements, data, models, and reference standards that are required to enhance U.S. industrial competitiveness in the world market and to improve public health, safety, and environmental quality. Refer to the MML website for more information on the Material Measurement Laboratory. 2. PURPOSE The purpose of this acquisition is to develop IT models, IT standard reference implementations, IT tools, standard reference database (SRD) applications, and support scientific and technical information archival projects as required by the ITL and MML. 3. CONTRACT TYPE The base contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract. All task orders awarded against the base IDIQ contract shall be Firm-Fixed Price. 4. DEFINITIONS AND REFERENCE INFORMATION Definitions (i) "Standard" means a Standards Development Organization (SDO) approved standard or a specification or implementation guide from a professional or technical society or government agency; (ii) "IT Model" is a representation of a standard or architecture using Unified Modeling Language (UML). Models shall be defined using the UML modeling language to emulate the behavior of the system to be developed (see http://www.uml.org/); (iii) "IT Standard Reference Implementations" are computer applications that conform to a given standard or specification. They will be developed from the model or directly from the standard or specification and represent an implementation of the standard or implementation guide being tested or developed; (iv) "IT Testing Tools" are computer applications built to test implementations of a standard or a portion of a standard when it cannot be tested as a whole. Several tools may be required for test suite for the standard; (v) "Standard Reference Database (SRD) Applications" include data of physical or chemical properties and are readily extensible to similar systems; (vi) "Archival Data Sets" (that are not part of the SRD program) are data sets that take information that NIST is ready to make available to the public to enable rapid

PAGE 11 OF 58

dissemination of scientific and technical data information to the scientific community and the public. Reference Information (i) The following information is provided to provide an example of and IT Model, IT Standard Reference Implementation and IT Testing Tool as defined above. NIST developed a UML model and reference implementation for a standard on Material Declaration. IPC-1752A Materials Declaration Management provides an improved standard for companies in the supply chain to share information on materials in products. NIST helped the standards body (IPC) develop a UML model (http://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/ei/upload/ipc1750_v2_rc4a.jpg) of the data flow required to support the exchange of information. From the UML model, NIST developed a reference implementation called SCRIBA (http://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/ei/scriba.cfm). SCRIBA is a basic and free open source product which is a Java-based tool that supports all the major features of IPC-1752A. With SCRIBA users can enter data, save files, print PDF documents, and export 1752 documents in XML format. NIST requires this type of activity ­ to develop a UML model of the standard or implementation guide and then generate XML Schemas/APIs directly from the model so reference implementations like SCRIBA and tools to help with implementation can be developed, in each of the domains listed in the next section. (ii) By supporting the production, collection, and dissemination of critical reference data in the physical sciences, NIST fulfills its role having primary responsibility in the Federal Government for providing reliable scientific and technical reference data and for coordinating activities on a national scale through National Standard Reference Data System (NSRDS, http://www.nist.gov/srd/nsrds.cfm) established in 1963 and under the Standard Reference Data Act (Public Law 90-396, http://www.nist.gov/srd/upload/publiclaw90-396.pdf) of 1968. These data activities are conducted by scientists at NIST and much of this data is disseminated through 80 NIST scientific and technical database applications. For more information about the Standard Reference Data (SRD) program at NIST and details about the many individual SRD Databases, see http://www.nist.gov/srd/ and supplementary information contained in the appendix of this document: "NIST Data Activities Overview" and "NIST Data Activities List." Examples of NIST SRD databases available free online are SRD 169 NIST Chemistry Webbook (http://webbook.nist.gov) and SRD 17 Chemical Kinetics Database (http://kinetics.nist.gov). Examples of NIST SRD databases available for purchase are SRD 31 Phase Equilibria Diagrams Database (http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist31v32.cfm) and SRD 84 FIZ/NIST Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist84.cfm). Both of these databases available for purchase have free demonstration versions. (iii) The following documents provide background on the standards development process and are representative of the reference materials NIST would utilize when developing standards. Other applicable documents may be provided within the context of a given task order. Specific guidance on implementing the above document will be provided in each task order. -American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Essential Requirements: Requirements for American National Standards, January 2010 (http://www.nist.gov/itl/ansi/upload/2010ANSIEssentialRequirements.pdf); Due Process

PAGE 27 OF 58

ORDERING PROCEDURES UNDER MULTIPLE AWARD INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY CONTRACTS Individual task orders will be procured through competition among awardees. Competition will be limited to awardees only. This section sets procedures and criteria that will be used to provide multiple awardees a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order issued under the resultant contract in accordance with FAR 16.505 Ordering. (a) Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, for orders issued under multiple award IDIQ's, each awardee will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order in excess of $3,000.00. Accelerated or streamlined procedures, such as e-mail or fax proposals will be utilized. The Government need not contact each of the contract awardees before selecting a task order awardee if the Government has information available to ensure that each Contractor is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order. (b) Awardees need not be given an opportunity to be considered for each order in excess of $3,000.00 under multiple award IDIQs if the Government determines that: (1) The agency's need for such supplies or services is of an urgency that providing such opportunity would result in unacceptable delays; (2) Only one Contractor is capable of providing such supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized; (3) The order should be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered on the original award. (c) Ordering will take place through a competitive process. A request for quotation package will be forwarded to awardees via e-mail or fax. The following documents will be included in the request for quotation package: (1) A complete statement of work including the required tasks, deliverables, period of performance, associated information or documentation, and name and contact information for the responsible Contract Specialist; (2) The due date and time for quotations; Written solicitations and required specifications will be sent via facsimile or e-mail to each awardee's Senior Program Manager. To the maximum extent practicable, awardees will be permitted 10 calendar days to respond to RFQs. Facsimile and e-mail quotations shall be acceptable providing all required information is included. When submitting a facsimile or e-mail response, the Contractor agrees to be bound by the facsimile authorized signature or the originator of the e-mail the same as if submitted under an original signature. Only information transmitted through the fax machine or received in the e-mail in-box of the Contract Specialist on or before the due date and time for quotations will be considered. It is the responsibility of each awardee to ensure that the complete quotation is submitted such that it is received timely by the Government. Late quotations, or portions thereof, will not be considered;

PAGE 28 OF 58

Upon receipt of the Request for Quotation Package, Contractors shall prepare a firm fixed-price quotation and submit that quotation to the Contract Specialist on or before the date and time specified in the RFQ; The firm fixed-price quotation shall include all labor and other direct costs associated with the required work; (d) All timely quotations will be reviewed by the Contract Specialist, the COR and/or other authorized NIST Technical Personnel. If it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government, the Contracting Officer will enter into discussion with the offeror(s). If discussions are conducted, the Contracting Officer will request a revised quotation. Revised quotations will be re-evaluated by the COR and the Contracting Officer. Awardees should submit their best quotation in responding to individual Requests for Quotation, as the Government anticipates making awards without discussions. Awardees are not obligated to submit quotes for all requirements. Failure to submit a quote for one RFQ and/or late submission of a quote for any given task order will not preclude an awardee from being considered for future task orders. The Government does expect the courtesy of a "No Quote" if an offeror chooses not to respond to any given RFQ. Multiple no quotes or late quotes will be considered during evaluation of offerors performance prior to the exercise of option periods. (e) Award will be made to the Contractor submitting the quotation that represents the best value to the Government. While the Government anticipates awards being made a low price basis, the Government reserves the right to make award on a best value basis. RFQs will identify evaluation factors for award and the criteria for best value. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated individually. Best value will be determined in accordance with the criteria identified in the solicitation. (f) Every order placed under the IDIQ will be separately evaluated for price reasonableness by the Contract Specialist and the Contracting Officer. (g) The Contracting Officer will issue a firm fixed-price task order to the successful Contractor. The Optional Form 347 will be utilized for award and will be signed by the Contracting Officer. (h) Upon receipt of an executed task order, the Contractor must commence work as required by that order.

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)

(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.
PAGE 30 OF 58

(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor?s knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor?s impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government?s rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor?s organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor?s potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor?s own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

L. 1 52.215-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS--COMPETITIVE ACQUISITION (JAN 2004)

(a) "Definitions." As used in this provision-"Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer`s discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. "In writing," "writing," or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation`s closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award. "Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) "Amendments to solicitations." If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) "Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals." (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision. (2) The first page of the proposal must show-(i) The solicitation number; (ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available); (iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item; (iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the offeror`s behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and (v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal.

(3) "Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals." (i) Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modifications or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii) (A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government`s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.

PAGE 47 OF 58

(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award. (4) Unless otherwise specified in the solicitation, the offeror may propose to provide any item or combination of items. (5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S. dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

Withdrawals are effective upon receipt of notice by the Contracting Officer. (d) "Offer expiration date." Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) "Restriction on disclosure and use of data." Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall-(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed-in whole or in part-for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in connection withthe submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government`s right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and (2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal. (f) "Contract award."

(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government`s interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror`s initial proposal should contain the offeror`s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. (6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government`s best interest to do so.

PAGE 48 OF 58

(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. (8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. (9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk. (10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable: (i) The agency`s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror`s offer.

(Reference 52.217-5) M. 2 1352.215-74 BEST VALUE EVALUATION (APR 2010)

(a) Award will be made to the offeror: whose offer conforms to the solicitation requirements; who is determined responsible in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.1 by possessing the financial and other capabilities to fulfill the requirements of the contract; and whose proposal is judged, by an integrated assessment of price/cost and non-price evaluation factors, to provide the best value to the Government in accordance with CAR 1352.215-75, Evaluation Criteria. (b) The Government intends to award multiple contracts in response to the solicitation. The Government reserves the right not to award a contract depending on the quality of the proposals submitted and the availability of funds. (c) Evaluation of Proposals (1) Initial Evaluation of Proposals. All offers received will be evaluated in accordance with the stated evaluation factors. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions based solely upon initial proposals. Therefore, offerors should ensure that their initial proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed. If award is not made upon initial proposals, then the Contracting Officer will establish a competitive range comprised of the most highly rated proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly- rated proposals. Only those offerors in the competitive range will be offered an opportunity to participate further in the procurement. (2) Discussions/Final Proposal Revisions. The Contracting Officer will engage in discussions with all offerors in the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306. At the conclusion of discussions, a final common cut-off date for submission of final proposal revisions will be established. Those offerors remaining in the competitive range will be notified to submit Final Proposal Revisions. (3) Final Evaluation of Offers. A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revisions. (End of clause)

BEST VALUE The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. In addition to price, the following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: FACTOR FACTOR FACTOR FACTOR A B C D ­ ­ ­ TECHNICAL APPROACH EXPERIENCE PERSONNEL PAST PERFORMANCE

In determining best value, all non-price factors, when combined, shall be approximately equal in importance to price. Technical Approach, Experience, and Personnel shall be approximately equal in importance. Past Performance shall be approximately half as important to Technical Approach, Experience, and Personnel. FACTOR A ­ TECHNICAL APPROACH Subfactor 1 ­ Technical Understanding The Government will evaluate the offeror's overall understanding of the statement of work and mock task orders, and the feasibility of the approach to complete the mock task orders. Subfactor 2 ­ Management Approach and Staffing Plan The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror's proposal demonstrates its plan for recruiting and retaining personnel using the Government-provided labor categories. The Government will also evaluate the offeror's ability to manage a team of

PAGE 57 OF 58

personnel, including subcontractors, specifically, reviewing and processing submitted task orders, handling visas for foreign nationals, resolving conflicts, and mitigating delays. FACTOR B ­ EXPERIENCE Experience of the prime contractor including all proposed subcontractors shall be evaluated. The Government will evaluate the degree of and relevance of the experience the offeror possesses performing projects similar in scope to the work described in Section C. FACTOR C - PERSONNEL The Government will evaluate the degree and relevance of the experience and expertise the Project Manager and proposed personnel at Levels IV and V possess for the roles for which they are proposed. FACTOR D - PAST PERFORMANCE Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or other relevant references. Past Performance evaluation shall determine the overall quality of the services and end products provided by the Contractor. Offerors with no relevant Past Performance or for whom information on Past Performance is not available, shall not be rated favorably or unfavorably, and will be assigned a Neutral rating. Offerors who do not clearly state that they do not have any relevant Past Performance may be rated negatively. PRICE EVALUATION The proposed price will be evaluated but not scored. The price evaluation will determine whether the proposed rates are realistic, complete, and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements. While the pricing for the mock task orders will not constitute actual orders, the proposed prices will be evaluated for realism and reasonableness, and to further determine the offerors' understanding of the work required. Proposed prices must be entirely compatible with the technical proposal.
