____________________________________________________________________________________



ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:



HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.81 per hour or $152.40 per week or $660.40 per month



VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or

successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 20 years.  Length of service

includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or

successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the

performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)



HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther

King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor

Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A

contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in

accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)







THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:



1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does

not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,

administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because

most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate

not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per

week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.

400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations

within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not

list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey

data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds

$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For

example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties

within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer

occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,

then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the

conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage

determination.



Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer

industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer

professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees

who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:

    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including

consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional

specifications;

    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or

modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and

related to user or system design specifications;

    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer

programs related to machine operating systems; or

    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which

requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).



2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you

work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential

and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.

 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your

regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday

premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime

(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered

overtime work).





HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees

employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or

in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This

includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive

ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder

and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.

  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations

on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations

involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.



A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that

represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to

ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials

which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the

employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the

like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.

All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and

incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials

are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for

ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.



** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **



If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract

(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or

local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an

employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage

determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the

following standards as compliance:



The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an

adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual

cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made

the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to

this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining

agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary

affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning

and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in

those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"

materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do

not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial

laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms

of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,

there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.



The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the

"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,

unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A

links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.

gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at

http://wdol.gov/.



REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form

1444 (SF 1444)}



Conformance Process:



The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is

not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to

be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage

determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable

relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted

classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such

conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the

fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by

the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)

of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall

be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}

When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444

should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be

conformed.



The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:



1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed

occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).



2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order

proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each

proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage

rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the

authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized

representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the

contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees

performs any contract work.



3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report

of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent

information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage

and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,

for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).



4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or

disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or

notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process

the request.



5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.



6) The contractor informs the affected employees.



Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.



When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of

Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure

that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the

wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that

determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.

Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide

classifications listed in the wage determination.

GENERAL NAF PROVISIONS GENERAL PROVISIONS l. DEFINITIONS (JAN 2005) - As used throughout this contract, the following terms and abbreviations have the meanings set forth below: a. The term "contract" means this agreement or order and any modifications hereto. b. The abbreviation "NAFI" means Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality of the United States Government. c. The term "Contracting Officer" means the person executing or responsible for administering this contract on behalf of the NAFI, which is a party hereto, or their successor or successors. d. The term "Contractor" means the party responsible for providing supplies and/or services at a certain price or rate to the NAFI under this contract. e. The abbreviation "FAR" means Federal Acquisition Regulation. 2. DISPUTES (NOV 2005) a. Except as otherwise provided in this contract, any dispute or claim concerning this contract which is not disposed of by agreement shall be decided by the Contracting Officer, who shall state his decision in writing and mail or otherwise furnish a copy of it to the Contractor. Within 30 days from the date of receipt of such copy, the Contractor may appeal by mailing or otherwise furnishing to the Contracting Officer a written appeal addressed to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, and the decision of the Board shall be final and conclusive; provided that if no such appeal is filed, the decision of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive. The Contractor shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence in support of any appeal under this clause. Pending final decision on such a dispute, however, the Contractor shall proceed diligently with the performance of the contract and in accordance with the decision of the Contracting Officer unless directed to do otherwise by the Contracting Officer. b. A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. Contractors shall provide the certification specified below when submitting any claim. Any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim may execute the certification. "I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify on behalf of the Contractor." c. This "Disputes" clause does not preclude consideration of law questions in connection with decisions provided for in paragraph "a" above, provided, that nothing in this contract shall be construed as making final the decision of any administrative official, representative, or board on a question of law. 3. LAW GOVERNING CONTRACTS (JAN 2005) - In any dispute arising out of this contract, the decision of which requires consideration of law questions, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted and determined in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America.

FA4809-14-T-0010 Page 6 of 29 4. LEGAL STATUS (JAN 2005) - The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States. 5. EXAMINATION OF RECORDS (JAN 2005) - This clause is applicable under contracts that are entered into by means of negotiation and where price and costing data are required to support a determination of price reasonableness. This clause does not apply to commercial items or when the Contracting Officer determines that prices agreed upon are based on adequate price competition. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative shall have the right to examine and audit the books and records of the Contractor directly pertaining to the contract during the period of the contract and until the expiration of three years after the final payment. 6. ASSIGNMENT (JAN 2005) - The Contractor or its assignee's rights to be paid amounts due as a result of performance of this contract, may be assigned. No assignment by the Contractor, assigning its rights or delegating its obligations under this contract will be effective and binding on the NAFI until the written terms of the assignment have been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. 7. GRATUITIES (JAN 2005) a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract. b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee. c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract. 8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) - The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2. 9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract. 10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005) a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to- (i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension; (ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or (iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below). (2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure. b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated. c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4)

FA4809-14-T-0010 Page 7 of 29 floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any (1) completed supplies, and (2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest. e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders. f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI. g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract. 11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (Nov 2011) - Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Not withstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. Acceptance of the supplies or services or a written notice of rejections must be accomplished on or before the third working day following delivery of the supplies or services, unless otherwise specified in this contract. 12. VARIATION IN QUANTITY (JAN 2005) - No variation in quantity of any item called for by this contract will be accepted unless authorized by the Contracting Officer. 13. PARTIAL DELIVERIES (JAN 2005) - Partial deliveries are not permitted unless authorized by the terms of the contract or approved by the Contracting Officer. 14. PAYMENTS (JAN 2005) - Partial payments will be made when deliveries are authorized or as approved by the Contracting Officer. Payments and penalties for late payments are subject to the requirements established by the Prompt Payment Act, as amended, and as implemented for NAFI's. If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment. 15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees. 16. MODIFICATIONS (JAN 2005) - No agreement or understanding to modify this contract will be binding upon the NAFI unless made in writing and signed by a Contracting Officer from the office that issued the contract or its successor. 17.

As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices. b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date.

(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated. (iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ___ ) are, ( ___ ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency, (2) ( ___ ) Have, ( ___ ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) ( ___ ) Are, ( ___ ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ___ ) Have, ( ___ ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
