52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in

(4) "Ocean transportation" means any transportation aboard a ship, vessel, boat, barge, or ferry through international waters.

to perform results from, or is conditioned upon, award of the prime contract and who is performing any part of the work or other requirement of
the prime contract.

(6) "Supplies" means all property, except land and interests in land, that is clearly identifiable for eventual use by or owned  by the DoD at
the time of transportation by sea.

(i) An item is clearly identifiable for eventual use by the DoD if, for example, the contract documentation contains a reference to a DoD
contract number or a military destination.

(ii) "Supplies" includes (but is not limited to) public works; buildings and facilities; ships; floating equipment and vessels of every
character, type, and description, with parts, subassemblies, accessories, and equipment; machine tools; material; equipment; stores of all
kinds; end items; construction materials; and components of the foregoing.

(7) "U.S.-flag vessel" means a vessel of the United States or belonging to the United States, including any vessel registered or having national
status under the laws of the United States.

(b)(1) The Contractor shall use U.S.-flag vessels when transporting any supplies by sea under this contract.

(2) A subcontractor transporting supplies by sea under this contract shall use U.S.-flag vessels if--

(i) This contract is a construction contract; or

(ii) The supplies being transported are--

(A) Noncommercial items; or

(B) Commercial items that--

(1) The Contractor is reselling or distributing to the Government without adding value (generally, the Contractor does not add value to items
that it contracts for f.o.b. destination shipment);

(2) Are shipped in direct support of U.S. military contingency operations, exercises, or forces deployed in humanitarian or peacekeeping
operations; or

(3) Are commissary or exchange cargoes transported outside of the Defense Transportation System in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2643.

to the sailing date necessary to meet its delivery schedules.  The Contracting Officer will process requests submitted after such date(s) as
expeditiously as possible, but the Contracting Officer's failure to grant approvals to meet the shipper's sailing date will not of itself

(2) Required shipping date;

(3) Special handling and discharge requirements;

(4) Loading and discharge points;
