1 Background
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) provides leadership for a national program in diseases of the heart, blood vessels, lung, and blood; blood resources; and sleep disorders. The Institute plans, conducts, fosters, and supports an integrated and coordinated program of basic research, clinical investigations and trials, observational studies, and demonstration and education projects. Research is related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, and blood diseases; and sleep disorders. The NHLBI plans and directs research in development and evaluation of interventions and devices related to prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of patients suffering from such diseases and disorders. It also supports research on clinical use of blood and all aspects of the management of blood resources. Research is conducted in the Institute's own laboratories and by scientific institutions and individuals supported by research grants and contracts. The Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBI) provides support and leadership for the Institute for all aspects of biocomputing through three branches that have overlapping missions and work in close cooperation. Planning, Architecture, Communication, and Evaluation (PACE) Branch Information Technology Resources Branch (ITRB) Applications Development and Support Branch (ADSB)

CBI's objective is to build, over time, an integrated information and knowledge environment supporting the full span of the Institute's mission. This includes programs of extramural and intramural research that are basic, clinical, or translational. It also includes the planning and administration of these programs, as well as education, dissemination, and outreach. An integrated environment will provide individuals with all the information and knowledge resources required to complete complex tasks, even though these resources may physically reside in different computer systems. CBI supports Information Technology for the NHLBI, including but not limited to: strategic planning, project management, and enterprise systems development. As part of the IT responsibilities, CBI oversees continuous operations of IT infrastructure, including new network development, desktop and network support, and information security. CBI also maintains IT systems and databases for tracking and reporting of extramural and intramural programs and activities, and when necessary develops and implements new systems. CBI recommends and implements IT policies and procedures; studies, evaluates and tests new technologies (hardware, software, and information systems); designs methods to communicate with all NHLBI stakeholders, both internal and external; and develops new methods for managing knowledge in addition to developing information architecture for the Institute. The contractor will support the CBI in their mission to provide the above services but primarily in the areas of enterprise and information architectures, business process

1. Background and Enterprise Architecture Process Requirements
Without a methodology systems development becomes haphazard and subsequently a risky and expensive undertaking in terms of cost, schedule, and quality. To mitigate this risk NIH established the following enterprise architecture principle: "Developers and maintainers of enterprise applications will have a documented systems development life cycle (SDLC)." Though it is not in the scope of the NIH Enterprise Architecture to mandate an agency-wide SDLC, this document describes a traditional SDLC that organizations may use as a starting point for developing and documenting SDLCs for enterprise systems. Organizations responsible for implementing and maintaining enterprise systems are responsible for the documentation, publication, and management of their local SDLC. SDLCs for all enterprise systems must include the following enterprise architecture processes steps in the SDLCs for new system implementation or release management (see Figure 1): ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ System Concept Development Phase: contribute to the system definition Planning Phase: provide patterns and bricks Requirements Analysis Phase: provide enterprise architecture (EA) requirements and review final document Design Phase: review integration and technology, the data model, and interface definition Development Phase: none Integration and Test Phase: participate in the final integration review Implementation Phase: participate in the post implementation review Operations and Maintenance Phase: check system during each enhancement cycle Disposition Phase: none

For those that use a more iterative style of SDLC, please reference Figure 2 to view the impact of EA on this type of SDLC. In both diagrams, note the placement of outside drivers and their interaction with the SDLC: ˇ CPIC ­ Capital Planning and Investment Control. At designated milestones in the life cycle of a project/system, analysis is conducted on the investment feasibility of the IT project/system. ˇ C&A ­ Certification and Accreditation. Before implementation of an IT system, an audit of the system security controls is conducted to certify that they are in accordance with mandated guidelines. ˇ FSMA ­ Federal Security Management Act. The status of security of all implemented IT systems must be reported on an annual basis to OMB.

2. Introduction to the Systems Development Life Cycle: The Nine Phases of the SDLC Framework
The SDLC framework describes a broad and diverse set of activities for addressing information systems efforts. This framework will help address the needs of other organizations tasked with the following associated responsibilities: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Ensuring available funding for development and system life-cycle costs Ensuring the security and integrity of the system Maintaining the system until system retirement Training system users Maintaining and disposing of NIH records

The full life-cycle model is divided into nine phases. Depending on the size and complexity of a project, alternative work patterns may be selected that will result in the combining or overlapping of specific phases. Not every project will require that every phase be executed. In Exhibit 1, Life Cycle phases, all nine phases are presented depicting the traditional, full, sequential work pattern. Note: In the iterative type of SDLC, a set of phases may be completed for each component, as the system is built up consecutively of components. 2.1 System Concept Development Phase System concept development actually starts the life cycle when a need to develop or significantly change a system is identified. Once a business need, based on operational requirements, is identified and documented the approaches for meeting it must be reviewed for feasibility and appropriateness. The need may involve development of a new system or modification of an existing system. Approvals and funding are needed before beginning the Planning phase. 2.2 Planning Phase The Planning phase begins after the project has been defined and resources have been committed to the project. A project plan is developed that documents the approach to be used and includes the discussion of methods, tools, tasks, resources, project schedules, and user input. 2.3 Requirements Definition Phase Functional user requirements are formally defined in a Functional Requirements Document (FRD). The requirements are delineated in terms of data, system performance, security, and maintainability requirements for the system. All requirements are defined to a level of detail sufficient for systems design to proceed. See Exhibit 2 for a template for the FRD. 2.4 Design Phase The external physical characteristics of the system are designed during this phase. The operating environment is established, major subsystems and their inputs and outputs are defined, and

McKay

SDLC Framework v1.0 January 2006

processes are allocated to resources. Everything requiring user input or approval must be documented and reviewed by the user. The internal physical characteristics of the system are specified and a detailed design is prepared. Subsystems defined during the external design are used to create a detailed structure of the system. Each subsystem is partitioned into one or more design units or modules. Detailed logic specifications are prepared for each module. The Design phase ends with a formal design walk-through with the user and approval of the design by the System Owner.

2.5 Development Phase The detailed specifications produced during internal design are translated to executable software. Software is unit tested, integrated, and retested in a systematic manner. Hardware is assembled and tested. 2.6 Test Phase Subsystem integration, system, security, and user acceptance testing are all conducted during the Test phase. The user, with the Quality Assurance (QA) organization, validates that the functional requirements, as defined in the functional requirements document (FRD), are satisfied by the developed or modified system. 2.7 Implementation Phase The system or system modifications are installed and made operational in a production environment. The phase is initiated after the system has been tested and accepted by the user. The phase continues until the system is operating in production in accordance with the defined user requirements. 2.8 Operations and Maintenance Phase The system operation is ongoing. The system is monitored for continued performance in accordance with user requirements, and needed system modifications are incorporated. Operations continue as long as the system can be effectively adapted to respond to an organization's needs. When modifications are necessary, the system may reenter the planning phase, depending on the size and nature of the modification. 2.9 Disposition Phase The disposition activities ensure the orderly termination of the system and preserve the vital information about the system so that some or all the information may be reactivated in the future if necessary. Particular emphasis is given to proper preservation of the data processed by the system so that the data are effectively migrated to another system or archived in accordance with applicable records management regulations and policies for potential future access. 2.10 Phase Interaction Exhibit 3, Phase Interaction, shows the relationship among the life-cycle phases. Decisions reached and deliverables completed in one phase may be required in subsequent phases. As the project progresses, life-cycle documentation becomes an integral part of the development process. It may be necessary to cycle back to an earlier phase of the life cycle, particularly if an iterative design/development strategy is appropriate for the particular project. This strategy would be selected at the time of project initiation. Another example of looping back is to clear up problems that surface during testing ­ causing the project to move back into "development" again.

3. Documentation
The life-cycle methodology specifies which documentation will be generated during each phase. Some of the products may be the basis for the NIH information collection requirements, Information Resources Management (IRM) reviews, and cost-benefit analyses (CBAs). The outputs of SDLC documentation activities are typically categorized into two major types: process and product, as follows: ˇ Process DocumentationProcess documentation communicates status and direction. It addresses the actions required for developing, implementing, and maintaining the system. Process documentation is not updated after implementation; however, it should be retained for evaluation and general reference. Examples include project plans, timelines, funds required, procedures to be followed, project review reports, requirements documents, and design documents. Product DocumentationProduct documentation describes the system itself, what it is, how it is operated, and how it is to be maintained. It is most often used by individuals who were not directly involved in the system's development and instructs them on how to effectively operate, maintain, and use the system. Modifications to the system are reflected in the documents as they occur and new versions are distributed periodically. Examples include user manuals, operations manuals, and maintenance manuals.

ˇ

Some documentation remains unchanged throughout the systems life cycle while others evolve continuously during the life cycle. Other documents are revised to reflect the results of analyses performed in later phases. Each of the documents produced are collected and stored in a project file. It is the intent of this SDLC framework to provide a degree of flexibility in the documentation required for each new system. Very large system development projects will likely use a modular approach to development, delivering each module through a release strategy as it is completed. Small projects may utilize Joint Application Development, Rapid Application Development (RAD) and/or prototyping development methods. Either modular development or RAD would require a customized set of documentation. The specific list of documents and any modifications to the standard for each should be negotiated and agreed upon at the time of project initiation. Each of the documents should be reflected in the project plan. A list of deliverables by phase is provided in Exhibit 4, Phases and Deliverables.

4. Crosscutting Activities
There are a number of activities that crosscut the phases of the systems life cycle. These activities are addressed and summarized in the subsequent sections. 4.1 Requirements Management The purpose of requirements management is to establish and control the scope of system development efforts and facilitate a common understanding of system capabilities between the System Proponent, developers, and future users. The goal of the SDLC is that requirements for developed software be consistently documented and controlled and that software products conform to the requirements established. The requirements management process, involves identifying, tracking, and validating system requirements. This process is shown in Exhibit 5, Overview of Requirements Management Process. Requirements management establishes and maintains a common understanding between a customer, NIH or NIH management, and the software development team and tightly controls the establishment, prioritization, acceptance of, and changes to documented requirements. This kind of control ensures that customers, management, and the development team are aware of, and can agree to, any changes before they are made and enables the development team to adjust plans and designs according to accepted changes.

Functional Requirement Description
The functionality of the Enhanced Primary Verification Process will be an expansion of the functionality of the point of sale (POS) emulation logic that is currently in place to support primary verification queries to ASVI. The 200 employers who will be part of the Phase II TVS Pilot will submit data electronically via an interface with the ASVI system. All secondary information will be passed electronically to the LA FCO from ASVI for secondary verification. After a determination has been made on a case, the status verifier will then send the response back to the employer electronically; the return path is the exact opposite of the preceding path to the FCO. The new system will be capable of tracking information on each case throughout both the primary and secondary verification processes. A = ANALYSIS I = INSPECTION

4.2 Project Planning Project planning is documented for every effort regardless of size, scope, or complexity. The project plan documents three important project aspects: the work approach, commitments, and estimates of the effort, as follows: ˇ Work approachIncludes documenting the project development strategy, selected alternative work pattern, adjustments to the life-cycle structure, selection of tools and methodologies, identification of applicable reviews and approvals, and project standards and procedures Work estimatesIncludes documenting the schedule, staffing and resources needed, and an estimate of the size of the software work products to be developed CommitmentsIncluding goals, constraints, and sponsorship

ˇ ˇ

The project plan is first produced in the Planning phase and is updated, expanded, and refined continually throughout the life cycle. An example of a project plan is shown in Exhibit 7, Project Plan. The project plan may be subject to approval by management for large projects or projects under their oversight.

4.3 Project Tracking and Oversight The goal of project tracking and oversight are to provide visibility into the software development efforts, as described in the project plan. Project tracking and oversight includes reviewing accomplishments to date, comparing estimated to actual efforts, adjusting plans, and communicating the results. The project tracking and oversight process permits the system proponent to continually assess and manage risks, future resource requirements, and recommend corrective actions.

4.4 Configuration Management Continual, consistent documentation of the development and evolution of the system is essential to ensure that at all points in the systems life cycle key analyses and decisions are recorded, and that the system is accurately described. The mechanisms for accomplishing this are performed by Configuration Management (CM). CM is a discipline consisting of the following four major elements: ˇ ˇ IdentificationThe selection and labeling of all functional and physical characteristics of the hardware and software ControlThe evaluation, coordination, approval, and implementation of all approved changes to the contents of an established configuration baseline, that is, described characteristics of the hardware and software Status accountingThe administrative support required and communication of the status of the system throughout its life cycle Configuration auditsA formal examination of the configuration records and system documentation to verify that the system is accurately documented and that approved changes have been incorporated

ˇ ˇ

CM provides a set of tools and procedures to control changes to a system after life-cycle activities have begun. The template for each project to use to create its own plan for accomplishing CM can be found in Exhibit 8, Configuration Management Plan.

4.5 Quality Assurance QA is an independent function that objectively monitors and reports the application of methodology, policies, processes, procedures, and standards that contract and/or project personnel use to develop software products and services and/or hardware deliverables. QA provides the methods and procedures to ensure that the software meets its requirements. The principle objective of QA is to assure integrity of the following: ˇ ˇ Deliverable software and its documentation Processes used to produce deliverable software

QA's role is to ensure that development systems are compliant with the SDLC and other established IT standards. In addition, QA involvement in project planning activities ensures project quality objectives are well defined, documented, and understood by all; and these quality objectives are supported by the proposed project plans and procedures that govern how tasks will be performed. QA works with the customer, Test and Evaluation (T&E), and CM to ensure that all necessary SDLC activities are performed. QA conducts audits and reviews at planned milestones and on special occurrences of unplanned events to determine compliance to project processes, to standard organizational processes, and to customer-defined standards. The format for creating a QA plan is contained in Exhibit 9, Quality Assurance Plan.

4.6 RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management (RM) refers to the assessment of potential outcomes of a project and the likelihood that one or more unsuccessful project outcomes may result. It also refers to the process of accepting, transferring, or mitigating risk. An outline of the RM plan is in Exhibit 10, Risk Management Plan. The RM plan consists of documenting and identifying project risks; the analysis, assessment, and prioritization of those project risks; laying out plans to implement actions to reduce the project risks throughout the project's life cycle. The plan provides a control mechanism to monitor, report, and direct all risk mitigation activities. The plan will be used by the Project Manager and coordinated with all externally affected project participants. The RM plan is initiated during the System Concept Development phase and is updated and revised during the subsequent phases up to, and including, the Test phase.

Purpose
In this section, present a clear, concise statement of the purpose of the RM plan. Include the name and code name of the project, the name(s) of the associated system(s), and the identity of the organization that is responsible for writing and maintaining the RM plan.

The tracking of risks in a risk identification list is a critical facet of successful system development management. The risk identification list is used from the beginning of the project and is a major source of input for the risk assessment activity. Following are examples of categories that may be a source of risk for a system development: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ The complexity, difficulty, feasibility, novelty, verifiability, and volatility of the system requirements The correctness, integrity, maintainability, performance, reliability, security, testability, and usability of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) deliverables The developmental model, formality, manageability, measurability, quality, and traceability of the processes used to satisfy the customer requirements The communication, cooperation, domain knowledge, experience, technical knowledge, and training of the personnel associated with technical and support work on the project The budget, external constraints, politics, resources, and schedule of the external system environment The capacity, documentation, familiarity, robustness, tool support, and usability of the methods, tools, and supporting equipment that will be used in the system development

Once the risks have been identified, document them in this section as the risk identification list. Steps for developing the risk identification list are the following:

McKay

Page 22

NRFC0004/BCP0003 ˇ ˇ

SDLC Framework v1.0

January 2006

ˇ

Number each risk using sequential numbers or other identifiers. Identify the SDLC document in which the risk is applicable. For instance, if you are working on the Configuration Management (CM) plan and discover a CM risk, identify the CM plan as the related document. Describe the risk in enough detail that a third party who is unfamiliar with the project can understand the content and nature of the risk.

Use the risk identification list throughout the life-cycle phases to ensure that all risks are properly documented. The project plan and the risk identification list are inputs to the risk assessment. Categorize the risks as internal or external risks. Internal risks are those that you can control. External risks are events over which you have no direct control. Examples of internal risks are project assumptions that may be invalid and organizational risks. Examples of external risks are Government regulations and supplier performance. Evaluate the identified risks in terms of probability and impact. For each risk item, determine the probability that this will occur and the resulting impact if it does occur. Use an evaluation tool to score each risk, such as the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ 0 1 2 3 4 5 No known risk exposure exists. Risks are inconveniences without serious impact. Risks threaten minor impact to process or product. Risks may disrupt the process or degrade the product. Serious risk to a major part of the project exists. Risk exposure threatens failure of the project.

In this section, document the results of the risk assessment. The risk identification list should be divided into two sections: external risks and internal risks. Then each risk should be scored with an evaluation tool category such as 0 for "no risk," up to 5 for "very serious risk." Review the risk items with high rankings and determine if the risks will be accepted, transferred, or mitigated. With the acceptance approach, no effort is made to avoid the risk item. This approach is usually employed because the risk items are the result of external factors over which you have no direct control. Two types of action are usually taken under the acceptance approach: contingency planning and no action. You can plan contingencies in case the risk does occur. Thus, the project team has a backup plan to minimize the affects of the risk event. Or you can take no action and accept responsibility if the risk event does indeed occur. With the transfer approach, the objective is to reduce risk by transferring it to another entity that can better bear it. Two methods of transferring risk are the use of insurance and the alignment of responsibility and authority. With the mitigation approach, emphasis is on actually avoiding, preventing, or reducing the risk. Some risks can be avoided by reducing the number of requirements or defining them more McKay Page 23

completely. For example, careful definition of the scope of a project in an SOW can avoid the possible consequence of "scope creep," or indecisive, protracted, and uncertain scope objectives. In this section, identify and describe in detail the actions that will be taken to transfer or mitigate risks that are prioritized as high in Section 4. These actions should ultimately result in the reduction of project risk and should directly affect the project plan and the metrics used for the project. Activities for reducing the effects of risk will require effort, resources, and time just like other project activities. The actions need to be incorporated into the budget, schedule, and other project plan components. Update the project plan components to ensure the planning and execution of risk action activities. Also, refer to contingency plan documents for any contingency plans that have been identified with the risk acceptance approach. Risk action plans will be used to direct all risk mitigation activities. The RM plan will need to be monitored and updated throughout the life-cycle phases.

4.7 Testing The goal of testing is to confirm that both individual system modules and the entire system are executed in accordance with the functional requirements and technical specifications. The types of test activities discussed in the subsequent sections are identified more specifically in the Test phase of the life cycle and are included in the test plan and test analysis report. ˇ Unit/Module TestingUnit/module testing is performed in the Development phase by the system development team. It consists of module/program level testing by validating the module's logic, adherence to functional requirements, and adherence to technical specifications. Subsystem Integration TestingSubsystem integration testing is conducted in the Test phase by the system development team. It tests the system's integrated groupings of software units and modules, otherwise known as subsystems. Test and EvaluationActivities validate the correct implementation of functional requirements as defined by the Functional Requirements Document (FRD) and its requirements traceability matrix. T&E participation during all major phases of the development life cycle, beginning with system planning and continuing through the operations and maintenance phase, ensures standardized identification, refinement, and traceability of the requirements as such requirements are allocated to the system components. The primary objectives of T&E include the following: - Ensuring that requirements are defined in a manner that is verifiable - Supporting the traceability of requirements from the source documentation to the design documentation to the test documentation - Verifying the proper implementation of the functional requirements ˇ User Acceptance TestingUser acceptance testing is conducted by the user, who tests every system feature for correctness and conformance to requirements. This test should be conducted using the proposed production platform. System interoperability, all documentation, system reliability, and the degree to which the system meets user requirements will be evaluated. Recovery and restart procedures should also be evaluated and tested. Security Testing and Evaluation (ST&E)ST&E is performed in the operational production environment. ST&Es are based on the results of the security risk assessment. ST&Es evaluate compliance with security and data integrity guidelines, and address security backup, recovery, and audit trails. ST&E ensures that all security measures have been properly implemented in the operating environment and are effective for satisfying security requirements. It addresses all aspects of security, including internal controls; hardware, software, and communications security controls; physical and environmental security; and administrative procedural security requirements.

4.8 Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) A CBA is a vital management tool for linking function and budget. The analysis is used to support investments in information technology. A preliminary assessment of costs and benefits is made during the strategic planning process and is refined and updated as appropriate throughout the remainder of the life cycle. At each phase, information is gathered and decisions are made that enable the project team to make increasingly accurate projections of the total costs and benefits of the system over its projected life. The CBA information is used to determine both the establishment and the continuation of a project. When the information system provides services to the public, NIH managers should quantify the performance of the information system through systematic measurement of outputs. Estimates of benefits are based on improvements to the overall work processes enabled by the new automated system. Benefits need not be restricted to savings in staff years, but can include enhancements to service to customers and other stakeholders, reductions in costs, or improvements in overall quality of the products and/or services produced. In conducting CBAs to support ongoing management oversight, agencies should seek to maximize return on investment over the information systems life cycle by establishing and evaluating systematic performance measures. These performance measures should include the following: ˇ ˇ ˇ Effectiveness of program, product, or service delivery (e.g., quality, speed, cost, customer satisfaction) Efficiency of program, product, or service management Reduction in burden, including information collection imposed on the public

The CBA must be updated as appropriate throughout the information systems life cycle, and the level of detail should be commensurate with the size of the investment. The revised CBA at each phase of the SDLC provides up-to-date information to ensure the continued viability of an information system before and during implementation. Reasons for updating a CBA may include such factors as significant changes in projected costs and benefits; major changes in requirements, including legislative or regulatory changes; or empirical data based on performance measurement gained through prototype or pilot experience. 4.9 Data Management Because of the large volumes of data handled by some NIH systems and the increasing trend toward sharing data across systems and programs, an integrated data management approach is required when developing information systems. To ensure effective management of all NIH data, all systems are created and maintained in accordance with best practice data management policies and practices. Life-cycle activities are to be carried out consistently with the existing and planned data management environment and data management concerns will be addressed during all phases of the life cycle. Every information system project must be cognizant of the NIH Enterprise Architecture model, must use NIH common data repositories (when appropriate), and must develop data access strategies in accordance with the NIH enterprise data management plan. Because certain kinds McKay Page 27

SDLC Framework v1.0

January 2006

of data sharing will become widespread, a rigorous and formal data management approach shall be used. This approach minimizes unexpected, adverse effects on the system and the programs it may support. The objectives of this approach are as follows: ˇ Ensure that data collected and disseminated meet programmatic requirements fully, including requirements for accuracy and timeliness ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Improve management decision making by providing better access to more accurate and timely data Increase productivity in the information collection and processing activities as the understanding and use of available data increases Ensure that existing data can be shared to the maximum practicable extent, avoiding the cost and confusion of redundant data collection and storage Reduce the cost of system maintenance and the time needed to modify implemented systems by designing more stable and flexible databases Data DictionaryUse of a data dictionary is mandatory for every system. Data dictionary entries must be prepared for every system to communicate clearly the attributes of the data processed by the system-to-system users and other individuals with an interest in the system data. Data AdministrationFor each project, data administration focuses on the relationship of the project to other projects and systems that process shared data. Data administration addresses data definitions, data standards, and mechanisms to ensure consistency of data across systems, data quality control procedures, and related issues that frequently cut across project and system boundaries.

Several important aspects of data management include the following: ˇ

ˇ

4.10 Privacy Act Considerations Various Federal statutes and regulations impose specific record keeping requirements related to the development, implementation, and maintenance of information systems. These requirements affect the Requirements Definition phase of the SDLC as follows: ˇ Development of Records Disposition Schedule--Federal regulations require that all records no longer needed for the conduct of the regular business of the agency be disposed of, retired, or preserved in a manner consistent with official Records Disposition Schedules. The decisions concerning the disposition criteria, including when and how records are to be disposed, and coordination with Records Management representatives to prepare the Records Disposition Schedule for the proposed system, are the responsibilities of the new system's proponent organization. It is important, however, for the NIH project manager or contact and system technical leaders to be involved in this process. - The project manager should be aware of any programmatic decisions (including records management-related factors) concerning a system for which NIH has development and operational responsibility.

McKay

SDLC Framework v1.0

- The project manager (and system technical leaders) may have technical knowledge that could influence the decisions to be made by the proponent organization. Therefore, the NIH project manager or contact should assist the proponent organization in coordinating with the Records Management representatives to prepare the Records Disposition Schedule for the proposed system. The Records Disposition Schedule is a required deliverable for the Requirements Definition phase of system development. ˇ Privacy Act Requirements--For any system that has been determined to be an official System of Records (in terms of the criteria established by the Privacy Act), a special System of Records Notice must be published in the Federal Register. This Notice identifies the purpose of the system; describes its routine use and what types of information and data are contained in its records; describes where and how the records are located; and identifies who the system manager is. While the Records Management representatives are responsible for determining if a system is a Privacy Act System of Records, it is the system owner or proponent organization's responsibility to prepare the actual Notice for publication in the Federal Register. As with the Records Disposition Schedule, however, it is the NIH project manager's responsibility to coordinate with and assist the Privacy Act Notice.

The System of Records Notice is a required deliverable for the Requirements Definition phase of system development. 4.11 Computer and Telecommunications Security Policy Considerations NIH's Information Systems Security office is responsible for protecting information assets against loss, theft, damage, and unauthorized destruction, modification, and access. To ensure system security, various security risk management activities must be performed throughout the systems life cycle. Security risk management includes identifying sensitive systems; conducting security risk analysis/assessment; developing sensitive system security plans, contingency plans, and security operating procedures; system security testing; and certifying and accrediting a system for operation in a particular security mode. To protect NIH's numerous and valuable system resources, effective security policies and procedures must be developed and implemented throughout the NIH. The NIH has security policies and procedures in place and continues to make additions and updates. The primary purpose of these policies and procedures is to provide a level of security commensurate with the value of the asset being protected. These security policies and procedures include administrative, computer and telecommunications information, personnel, and physical security requirements. The project manager needs to ensure that all security requirements are incorporated in each phase of the life cycle. The project plan, including the work breakdown structure, should identify: how and when the security requirements will be identified, defined, and refined; the security safeguards development efforts required during the project's Design phase; the testing criteria, development, and implementation efforts required during the Design and Testing phases; and the certification and accreditation efforts required during the acceptance testing.

McKay

SDLC Framework v1.0

January 2006

Various security program guidance documents have been written and published to consolidate all existing guidance on this subject and to provide supportive details to describe how security requirements may be defined and how safeguards that satisfy those requirements may be developed and implemented. The supportive details contain policies, procedures, and references that provide authority and specific guidance to be used in the preparation of prescribed documents.

5. Life-Cycle Reviews
The life-cycle review process consists of a series of reviews, shown in Exhibit 11, SDLC Reviews and Tests, conducted in each phase to ensure the successful completion of each phase of the project. This process ensures that all products created during the life cycle meet functional and performance requirements as outlined in all requirements documentation. The requirements for holding specific reviews are determined by the system size and complexity and by management direction. The completion of a phase represents a logical point at which reviews should occur. The purposes of reviews are as follows: ˇ To ensure that project direction and goals remain consistent with the organization's strategic plan and goals ˇ ˇ To provide an opportunity to terminate projects that fail to demonstrate an adequate return on investment To measure the ongoing progress (that is, budget, schedule, and deliverables) or value added and identify potential problems for corrective actions

ˇ To approve phase results and authorize further work The purpose of each review must be kept in mind during the review process to achieve each purpose before terminating the review. The appropriate personnel selected for the review team should be described in the project plan. In general, senior management involvement is greatest in the earlier phases of systems development efforts. This involvement declines in the later, more technical phases or in less critical projects involving fewer resources.

6. Planning, Methodologies, and Tools
To the extent that it is practical, all systems created and maintained by the NIH should use stateof-the-art development methodologies and modern systems development and maintenance tools. Methodologies and tools must be identified early in the life cycle to ensure consistency across life-cycle activities. Methodologies and tools cannot replace the application of systems lifecycle management. In addition to the life cycle phases described additional methodologies and tools may be used before or during systems development. 6.1 Strategic Planning The purpose of Strategic Planning for Information Systems is to ensure that all information systems development activities support the NIH's strategic goals. For these to be known and agreed to throughout the different component agencies, the NIH goes through a business planning process called Strategic Planning. The scope of Strategic Planning includes the entire set of activities that the NIH performs. This planning process produces and updates a plan that is enterprisewide. The plan is also dynamic, meaning that it is always subject to change and to

McKay

Page 31

NRFC0004/BCP0003

SDLC Framework v1.0

January 2006

rigorous change management control. Strategic Planning is not part of the SDLC, but determines what information systems projects get started and/or continue to receive funding. Strategic Planning for Information Systems controls all SDLC application systems projects decided by the benefits each project produces and how these benefits support the NIH Strategic Plan. The description of the Strategic Planning process is outside the scope of the SDLC. However, several important follow-on activities that must be taken are outlined in the next section. 6.1.1 Strategic Management Process The aim of the Strategic Management Process is to identify potential improvements to NIH information systems and to gain commitment of the required resources to change these systems. Exhibit 12, Strategic Management Process, depicts the major elements of this effort. Exhibit 12: Strategic Management Process

This strategic management process ensures that effective plans are deployed and that "return on investment" is a key measure of performance. The feedback within the planning process allows for more efficient deployment of Information Resource Management (IRM) services that produce a greater value for the NIH. The planning process communicates to all involved what, how, and when events are to take place, and why they are important. It enables each individual application systems project to develop detailed plans that support the overall NIH effort, while solving project-specific problems.

6.1.2 Performance Measurement Performance measurement is an essential element in developing effective systems through a strategic management process. The mission, goals, and objectives of the NIH are identified in its strategic plan. Strategies are developed to identify how the NIH can achieve the goals. For each goal, the NIH establishes a set of performance measures. These measures enable the NIH to assess how effective each of its projects is in improving NIH operations. For the NIH to make this assessment, it determines the current performance level for each measure (performance level baseline) for the existing systems. For each project plan, as part of the economic analysis, the NIH estimates the performance levels it expects to reach as a result of the planned improvements. As the project's improvements are implemented, actual results are compared with the estimated gains to determine the success of the effort. Further analysis of the results may suggest additional improvement opportunities. The Administration and Congress are seeking improved methods for increasing efficiency in Government. Limited budget resources put an increased emphasis on performance measurement systems. A major step toward measuring results was the passage of the Chief Financial Officer Act of 1990, which requires agencies to provide annual audited reports that emphasize financial and program performance measures. Other laws calling for performance measures are the 1993 Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and the 1996 Cohen-Clinger Act (formally IMTRA). Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-94, Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs: Guidelines and Discounts, requires a program-based approach for justifying and evaluating information systems. A program approach requires examining an information system, typically a project, in the context of the functional programs it supports, such as economic analysis, federal budget preparation and monitoring, and drug control policy. It ties the lifecycle cost of the information system to the functional program through the CBA. It ties benefit analysis of the information system and the functional program to measurable high-level business objectives and requirements. The NIH, using the Strategic Management Process and the appropriate performance measures, defines the functional program that controls and determines which information systems are developed. This strategic management process ensures that the following elements are in place for establishing information system requirements: ˇ ˇ ˇ High-level objectives and requirements in the NIH strategic plan that drive the analysis and assessment of feasible alternatives Technical requirements clearly linked to the NIH program requirements through the identified performance measures Benefits and costs that are identified, analyzed, and measured within the confines of an information system

McKay

Page 33

NRFC0004/BCP0003

SDLC Framework v1.0

January 2006

Performance measures determine whether goals are achieved or requirements are met. They also make possible compliance with OMB Circular A-94, which states the following guidelines: ˇ ˇ ˇ Plan for periodic, results-oriented evaluations of program effectiveness using the quantified measures developed in the economic analysis Place a high priority on information system projects whose benefits accrue to the general public or to other levels of Government Understand that a request for funding approval of most information system projects is based on a reasoned tradeoff between using the funds for the information system and using the funds for other program objectives

6.2 Business Process Reengineering Business process reengineering (BPR) is performed to change the way an organization conducts its business. BPR is the redesign of the organization, culture, and business processes-- sometimes using technology as an enabler--to achieve significant improvements in costs, time, service, and quality. BPR efforts are generally initiated by the strategic planning process. Consequently, these efforts complement and/or augment the Strategic Management Process, and may result in the initiation of an application systems project(s). z Pre-Select ­ ­ Establish project Need Based on Strategic Drivers, Goals, Objectives, Initiatives ­ SDLC project created through Initial Investment Decision z Concept Development ­ ­ Establish project Context, Concept of Operations, and Implementation Strategy through creation of SDLC EA Products ­ Concurrence with project Concept via Concept Investment Decision z Business Capability Definition ­ ­ Define project Business Processes, Data, Performance, Standards, and Initial Infrastructure through creation of SDLC EA Products ­ project Execution Readiness via Business Capability Investment Decision z Program Execution ­ ­ Develop & Test project Infrastructure to provide desired Business Capabilities.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified

8

by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. (End of clause) Alternate I (Oct 2008). When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i) and (l) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. (4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly

9

rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may-- (A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property. (e) Definitions. (1) The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. As used in this clause-- (i) Direct materials means those materials that enter directly into the end product, or that are used or consumed directly in connection with the furnishing of the end product or service. (ii) Hourly rate means the rate(s) prescribed in the contract for payment for labor that meets the labor category qualifications of a labor category specified in the contract that are-- (A) Performed by the contractor; (B) Performed by the subcontractors; or (C) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control. (iii) Materials means--

10

(A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control; (B) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract; (C) Other direct costs (e.g., incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract, travel, computer usage charges, etc.); (D) The following subcontracts for services which are specifically excluded from the hourly rate: [Insert any subcontracts for services to be excluded from the hourly rates prescribed in the schedule.]; and (E) Indirect costs specifically provided for in this clause. (iv) Subcontract means any contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, entered into with a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of the prime contract or a subcontract including transfers between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor. It includes, but is not limited to, purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders. (i) Payments. (1) Services accepted. Payment shall be made for services accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destination(s) set forth in this contract. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: (i) Hourly rate. (A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer. (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative. (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.

11

(3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. (ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the-- (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor-- (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall-- (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract. (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. (1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert "None" if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert `None'."] (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert "$0" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert `None')."] (2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting

12

reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment-- (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); (B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures; (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost-- (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The

13

Contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall-- (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the-- (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and (D) Contractor point of contact. (ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. (6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if-- (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.6072). (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on-- (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or

14

(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the "completion invoice" and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. (7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. (8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. (9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number

15

of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.

47

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
