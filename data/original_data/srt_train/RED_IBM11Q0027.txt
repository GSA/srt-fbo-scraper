International Boundary and Water Commission –  Section



The International Boundary and Water Commission, US and Mexico, US Section (USIBWC) is a federal agency under the Department of State.  We are seeking a Commercially Available Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hydrologic data management solution, including hardware, software, technical support and training in its use.  The solution must be driven by a SQL-compatible database with robust multi-user functionality.  Once the contract has been awarded, USIBWC will require an initial face-to-face kick-off meeting.    Subsequent meetings can be performed via teleconference or in-person, depending on the need.  Furthermore, developmental work can occur at a location of the contractor’s choice.  Upon completion, the solution will be delivered to, housed, and maintained at USIBWC Headquarters, 4171 N. Mesa, Bldg C, El Paso, TX  79902-1441.  Given the critical role that hydrological data and its derivatives play at USIBWC, it is expected that potential contractors have subject matter expertise in hydrology and hydrologic data management.  The expected period of performance, from time of contract award to delivery of final product, should not exceed 6 months.



 Currently, hydrologic data management at the USIBWC is handled independently among the Water Accounting Division (WAD), Environmental Management Division (EMD), Clean Rivers Program (CRP), and GIS.  As a result, the methods with which data are stored and manipulated are inconsistent agency-wide.  



Numerical data are often stored in spreadsheets, which are notoriously at risk for corrupting data (e.g. sorting one column independently of others).  Proprietary home-grown binary files also store millions of records of data, however accessing these data relies on proprietary home-grown programs that are inflexible and clumsy when compared to a Structured Query Language (SQL) compatible storage schema.  Our outdated water bulletin production methods require users to enter much of the data manually.   



With our current limitations, interdepartmental exchanges of data are not streamlined and product generation is inefficient.  Given that much of the same data is used by different departments, we would like to be able to share data more efficiently.  In addition, various departments are storing similar station metadata, which results in unnecessary redundancy.   An integrated and modern approach to hydrologic data management would benefit all hydro-related operations at USIBWC, and the resulting consistency across the divisions would ensure agency-wide familiarity with data storage methods/schema.  Using the industry standard SQL would give us great flexibility in querying data as well as allowing multiple databases to relate to each other, some potential uses of this would be:

relating water quality and water quantity data to spatial data in a Geographic Information System (GIS),

relating water quality parameters to river discharges at the time of sampling,

automated report generation from multiple sources (e.g. water bulletins)

data display and graphing capabilities.



This document outlines a potential schema that would benefit multiple divisions with the agency.  Any potential solution should be capable of performing most, if not all, of the items discussed within.





Data Types



At a minimum, a hydrologic data solution for USIBWC must be able to store our data and relate them to a specific site in a SQL compatible relational database.  The majority of our data are time-stamped numerical values, but some exceptions are textual data such as site descriptors, station descriptors, and comments regarding a data record. Some specific numerical data types that must be handled are water quality parameters, river discharge values (instantaneous and mean daily), river stage values (instantaneous and mean daily), datum corrections for sensors in the field, shifts that relate a stream measurement to a rating curve, reservoir elevations, and reservoir storages.   Also important are external documents (e.g. detailed meter notes) that would need to relate to the database via a link or embedment as a binary large object (BLOB).



In addition to the above, much of the data USIBWC maintains has a spatial component.  Having the ability to relate our hydrologic data to a GIS spatial dataset, whether it is local or in a geodatabase,  would greatly enhance the value of our data and should be a required feature in any potential solution.



Once a solution is in place, users must have the flexibility to create/delete data tables, modify existing data tables, and manipulate relations between tables.  Modifications would include actions like adding/removing fields, updating values, and adding/removing entire records.





Data Input



Data will be input from a variety of sources, both in paper and electronic format.  Electronic formats can vary and include non-proprietary comma-delimited files, measurement files generated by field equipment, homegrown proprietary binary files, spreadsheets (Quattro Pro and Excel), local databases (MS Access, Oracle, etc.), web pages, and web hosted databases.  The software will need to be able to accept electronic data from local and remote clients via network connection.  Although not required, it would be preferred if the solution could also import data stored in WaterML format.



Ideally, the new solution  would  allow for automated data input from electronic sources in the interest of efficiency and accuracy.  Some data will need to be automatically input on an hourly basis (e.g. near real-time stages), whereas others may be scheduled less frequently or even manually initiated.  If an out-of-the-box solution doesn’t exist to automate importation from all of these sources, it will be sufficient to have the ability to create custom procedures to import our data.  Finally, the software must allow for the input of data with a digitizer.  Digitizers allow users to convert data from a paper chart format to an electronic tabular format with efficiency.



For data that are entered manually, it is imperative that the solution provides an easy-to-use interface that allows users to manipulate the database without intimate knowledge of programming logic.





Quality Assurance/Quality Control



Maintaining the integrity of data is a critical component of any data management solution, so ideally the new solution will have built-in tools specifically for quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC).   For example, errors that occur on a regular basis are measurement drift over time, a constant numerical shift on a portion of the data, or invalid measurements.  Water quality data may have dilution factors that change the detection limits, or flagged data such as limited analyte recovery.  Editing tools  shall allow USIBWC employees to quickly identify these types of errors and issues, log any edits so that they are reversible, and also provide a rapid way to validate these data.



The following list of features will help ensure no unknown or irreversible changes/damages occur to the data:

an easy-to-use, robust and reliable back-up procedure,

having access to the original raw data values (even after manipulation), and

automated logging of edits, thus allowing easy tracking of all changes to the data.



In addition to protecting the data, QA/QC tools  shall include data validation tools.  Data validation includes, but is not limited to:

easy detection of exceedance of accepted thresholds,

easy monitoring of rates of change,

easy way to label data as reliable, unreliable, or anywhere in between,

automated validation of the data type and format, for example:

ensuring date/time formats are consistent,

ensuring numbers are rounded consistently,

and ensuring no text are in numerical fields and vice-versa,

a manual validation and verification method, such as addition of fields for QC checks, comments, and reviewer information for water quality data, and

marking of data that have been manually checked, or alternatively, marking data that have not been reviewed.





Finally, QA/QC tools  shall include easy-to-use editing tools in a graphical environment.  Similar to data input, users should not need intimate knowledge of programming logic in order to edit/manipulate their data.





Product/Report Generation



USIBWC generates many products from its hydrologic data.  Some products occur on a scheduled basis, ranging from hourly to annually.  Products themselves vary and include various computations output into simple text files, web pages, graphs, and reports.



To maximize the agency’s efficiency, it is important that a hydrologic data management solution allow USIBWC to define custom calculations, custom product/report generation, and automate their execution on a scheduled basis.  



Some examples of these products/calculations include, but are not limited to:

provisional instantaneous discharge computation on an hourly basis,

provisional hydrograph generation on an hourly basis,

provisional reservoir storage computation on an hourly basis,

finalized mean daily discharge computations on a monthly basis, 

finalized reservoir storage computations on a monthly basis

stage/discharge rating curve generation and manipulation,

descriptive statistics on water quality parameters  (such as max, min, average, standard deviation, geometric mean, flow-weighted averages, etc.),

streamflow statistics on water quantity parameters (such as max, min, average, standard deviation, frequency analysis, etc.),

graphs, trendlines, and visual aids for understanding water quality parameters over time, and

annual water bulletin production, which details hydrologic data during a calendar year in print format.



In addition to our regularly occurring products, USIBWC often receives internal/external data requests.  As a result, it would benefit USIBWC to have flexible data querying that would allow us to retrieve data based on a variety of factors (e.g. date, thresholds, parameters, spatial attributes).  It would also be preferable, but not required, to have the option to export data to WaterML format.  Another preferable option is to have the ability to seamlessly tie hydrologic data into ESRI’s ArcGIS software if the data are related to a geographic location.



Similar to data input and QA/QC, creating custom querying, custom calculations, and custom products/reports should not require users to have intimate knowledge of programming logic.  Instead, customizing should be achievable in an intuitive graphical interface.  






Data Storage and Access



If feasible, it would be ideal for all divisions’ hydrologic data to be stored on a central database server.  Specifications for a server will be dependent on the particular solution that is chosen.  As specified earlier, the contractor is expected to provide any necessary hardware as part of the contract.



Data on the central server will need to be accessed by various clients on the network by USIBWC employees via a username/password mechanism.  As a result, internal network connections will also need to be secure to protect the database.  It is possible that there will be some sort of license restriction on the number of concurrent users, at a minimum USIBWC will need to be able to have 12 concurrent users on at any given time.  The number of concurrent users per location/division is as follows:





While all these locations need access, they will not need the same access/permissions to the same data.  Our future data solution needs to allow each division to set specific permissions on their own data in order to protect it.  For example, an employee(s) in WAD would be designated as the “WAD Data Admin”.  This employee would control the section of the central database that contains WAD data.  Control includes the rights to create and destroy data tables, records, and have the ability to set specific permissions on a particular user account.  In this case, the “WAD Data Admin” could create a data table to contain discharge data, define the parameters that would be included (e.g. Date, stage, discharge, time shift, etc.), and then grant EMD users read-only access whereas WAD users may get full read/write access.



Since there will only be one central server, it is absolutely essential that a reliable backup solution  be in place to protect the data.  This backup solution  shall include a frequently scheduled onsite backup and a less frequently used backup at the USIBWC offsite backup location.





Technical Support



In day-to-day operations and emergency situations, USIBWC will be relying on this data management solution.  Therefore external technical support  shall be a part of any hydrologic data management solution.  Support  shall  provide for troubleshooting over the phone, web, via remote connection to our database, or a site-visit if necessary.  Support  shall be available during normal business hours for our day-to-day operations.  Twenty-four hour support  shall be available during emergency situations (e.g. flood operations).





Division Roles



The agency is also requesting training be given to WAD personnel in some of the basic system/database administrator tasks.  WAD personnel are often working after-hours during emergency flood operations, and having the ability to rapidly troubleshoot/repair the database will help ensure the proper use of our floodways and reservoirs.



A key role in the proposed system is someone to ensure proper network access/security to the central database server.  



Finally, each division will need to establish power users that can set up data tables, database relations, and user permissions.  





Basis of Award:



a)	The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government (i.e., that which represents the best value to the Government), price and other factors considered. Technical acceptability and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.   While the cost or price factor has no numerical weight, it is a criterion in the overall evaluation of quotes.

b)	The Government may award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer. In the event that two or more offers are considered technically equivalent, the evaluated price will be of primary importance in determining the quote most advantageous to the Government.
