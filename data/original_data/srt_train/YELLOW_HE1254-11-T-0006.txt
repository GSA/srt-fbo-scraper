STATEMENT OF WORK Education Technology Creativity Tools
1.0 1.1. INTRODUCTION The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees by providing PK-12 instruction to approximately 87,000 students in seven states, twelve foreign countries, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The number of students varies based on the deployment of military troops worldwide. DoDEA's curriculum, resources, and student achievement scores on standardized assessments compare favorably to high-performing US public schools. DoDEA is divided into three administrative areas. DDESS (Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools) covers the schools in seven states and Puerto Rico, and for administrative purposes, Cuba. DoDDS (Department of Defense Dependent Schools) is divided into DoDDSEurope and DoDDS-Pacific. The former administers the schools in England, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and Bahrain. The latter covers the schools in Korea, Japan, and for administrative purposes, Guam. DoDEA also operates a fully accredited Virtual High School with its main office in Virginia and with teaching hubs in Germany and Korea. BACKGROUND DoDEA's Educational Technology Program is committed to facilitating a student-centered learning model by allowing students to work collaboratively and creatively across the curriculum in accordance with the principles of creativity and innovation, communication and collaboration, research and information fluency, critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making, digital citizenship, and technology operations and concepts set forth by the National Education Technology Standards (NETS).

2.2

DoDEA currently has creativity tools in place that address K-12 needs in graphic creation animation, photo imaging, video creation, screen capture, web development, and technology integration tutorials and related skills assessments, which are based on NETS and may be found at http://www.iste.org/standards.aspx. SCOPE DoDEA currently has the need to update the student content creation tools that are offered at age-appropriate levels across the curriculum. Student creation of content will include digital storytelling, digital video and image editing, animation/storyboarding, web development, screen capture/tutorial creation, and the ability to safely and effectively share these projects. Students and teachers will also need access to related digital tutorials and student assessment tools. In SY10-11 DoDEA has 195 schools (which includes the virtual school). There are over a dozen school configurations, including PK-12, PK-8, PK-6, PK-5, 6-8, 6-12, and 9-12. DoDEA schools also vary greatly in size with the largest at about 1,000 students and the smallest at about 30 students. Some DoDEA schools in remote locations overseas have significant connectivity issues. Although market research indicates that vendors are emphasizing online creativity tool products, DoDEA requires a two-tier approach. For the majority of schools, online tools can be used at school and at home (student use). However, due to connectivity issues, a minority of schools will require software tools for school use and online tools for student use at home. This is not a multiple award ID/IQ contract/s. The Government expects to award 1-3 contracts to meet its requirement. The length of the contract will be based on a base plus five option years. REQUIREMENTS PK-8 Creativity Tools--The Contractor(s) will provide the following age-appropriate tools: 4.1.1. Graphic creation/editing tool that allows the creation of original graphics or editing of existing graphics. Students should be able to create or import graphics as well as create and vector graphics. Digital Storytelling and Animation tool that can create and edit animation and movement of graphic representations in the facilitation of spoken essays. Photo-editing tool that includes options to import, edit, and export original digital photographs. Video production tool that imports a variety of digital video files (to include but not limited to AVI, MOV, RM, WMV, MPEG, MPEG4, and proprietary file types associated with cameras) and allows for import, editing, production, and export of video files in a variety of file types. Web development tool that allows for the creation, editing, and sharing of web pages that can incorporate multimedia, images, videos, and interactive development tools.

(b) Representation. [Complete only if the offeror is a women-owned business concern and has not represented itself as a small business concern in paragraph (b)(1) of FAR 52.219-1, Small Business Program Representations, of this solicitation.] The offeror represents that it ( ) is a women-owned business concern. (End of provision)

52.209-5

CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals(A) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have ( ) have not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or

HE1254-11-T-0006 Page 30 of 61 destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are ( ) are not ( ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and (D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.

HE1254-11-T-0006 Page 31 of 61

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSING AN INITIAL COMMERCIAL ITEM SUBCONTRACTING PLAN (modified for use on 20 Jun 07)

TYPE OF PLAN -- Any large business that does not have an approved small business subcontracting plan must submit a proposed plan to the Contracting Officer. This plan, when submitted, is a proposed Commercial Item Small Business Subcontracting Plan. It is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for this procurement, though the quoter/offeror may use a noncommercial plan instead. Commercial plans are good for the contractor's fiscal year, and do not have to be renegotiated for each contract requiring a plan. Noncommercial plans are good for the life of the contract involved, but must be renegotiated for each contract requiring a plan. PLAN SUBMITTAL -- An offeror submitting a proposed commercial plan must submit it to the first Contracting Officer awarding a contract subject to the plan during the Contractor's fiscal year. This proposed plan must be submitted as part of the offer. If that Contracting Officer is a DoDEA Contracting Officer, the plan must have at least the information shown on the following pages. Offerors submitting plans to DoDEA are requested to use the format shown on the following pages in their submittal. Plans already approved must be included in the offer. An approved commercial plan is generally valid for one year from the date of acceptance of the contract and is applicable to all other Government contracts. IDENTITY OF THE SUBCONTRACTING PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR -- Before a plan is approved, the offeror is requested to provide the name of the individual employed by the offeror who will administer the contractor's subcontracting program. This identity information should include the name, title, address and telephone number (as well as e-mail address, if known) of the subcontracting program administrator. PLAN START AND END DATES -- The proposed plan must specify the first and last dates when this plan will apply. If the format on the following pages is used, this is the "Period Covered By Plan." The Contracting Officer will specify the starting date. The offeror must specify the ending date. The ending date must be the last day of the offeror's current fiscal year. If that ending date is fewer than 30 federal government working days from the starting date, the offeror must either (a) fill in the ending date with the last date of the Contractor's next fiscal year, or (b) complete the Commercial Item Small Business Subcontracting Plan (Renegotiation/Renewal) in addition to the plan. (Using the ending date of the offeror's next fiscal year is usually much simpler.) Ensuing plans will coincide with the contractor's fiscal year. REASONABLE GOALS -- The offeror must select goals that are reasonable based on making good faith efforts (to be described in this plan) to use small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, service disabled veteran owned small business, and women-owned small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable. Contracting Officers will reject plans with unreasonably low goals, or efforts described herein that are not good faith efforts. QUESTIONS -- Should offerors have any questions regarding subcontracting plans, they should contact the DoDEA Small Business Specialist for this solicitation/contract.
