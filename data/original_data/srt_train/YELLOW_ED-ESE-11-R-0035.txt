Attachment A: PWS

2 Background The Department of Educations (ED) mission, as supported by the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act, is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation. Implementation of the Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX) is directly relevant to EDs Strategic Plan in Goal 1, Improve Student Achievement, which is the first of three goals that support EDs mission: "The Department of Education's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access." The Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) Office of Migrant Education (OME) is responsible for administering the Migrant Education Program (MEP). The MEP is authorized under Part C of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended. ED provides grants to States to operate the MEP and provide supplemental educational services for migrant students. The statutory purposes of the MEP set forth in Section 1301 are to:  Support high-quality and comprehensive educational programs for migrant children to help reduce the educational disruption and other problems that result from repeated moves. Ensure that migrant students who move among the States are not penalized in any manner by disparities among the States in curriculum, graduation requirements, and State academic content and student academic achievement standards. Ensure that migrant children are provided with the appropriate educational services (including supportive services) that address their special needs in a coordinated and efficient manner. Ensure that migrant children receive full and appropriate opportunities to meet the same challenging State academic content and student academic achievement standards that all children are expected to meet. Design programs to help migrant children overcome educational disruption, cultural and language barriers, social isolation, various health-related problems, and other factors that inhibit the ability of such children to do well in school and to prepare such children to make a successful transition to postsecondary education or employment. Ensure that migrant children benefit from State and local systemic reforms.











3 Purpose and Scope OME is mandated in the No Child Left Behind Act in Section 1308(b) to assist the States in developing effective methods for the electronic transfer of student records and in determining the

Attachment A: PWS

number of migratory children in each State. OME established the Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX) project to accomplish this mandate. The MSIX was implemented in September 2007 and currently supports migrant records for 97% of the migrant student population with 41 states having submitted data for inclusion in MSIX. This Performance Work Statement (PWS) is primarily a Fixed Price Performance-Based Acquisition (PBA) with mission-oriented objectives, event-driven performance measures, metrics and incentives and disincentives. The scope of this PWS encompasses Contractor support to provide the System Operations, Customer Support, Help Desk & Trouble Ticket Management, Asset Management, and State Support for the MSIX. In meeting the goals and objectives of this PWS, the Contractor shall: a. Ensure the MSIX remains fully functional and stable (e.g. bug-fixes, security upgrades, software patches), and complete all required system, hardware and software upgrades in a timely manner. Note: all upgrades or enhancements shall be coordinated with ED. b. Interface daily with customers and other MSIX personnel to maintain a high quality of support for MSIX. Responsibilities shall include system usage training for the customers, and rapid response to all technical problems reported to the Contractor by the customers or by MSIX staff. c. Be expected to install and maintain all MSIX hardware components and keep track of them via an automated reporting and tracking tool (Note: The contractor should include the tracking tool in the proposal and describe its features and functionality.) d. Perform Help Desk Support & Trouble Ticket Management tasks required to meet expected service levels and to support the end users of the MSIX. e. Meet related system security requirements. f. Support ED initiated MSIX staff training initiatives. The Contractor shall adhere to all Federal Government, Department of Education regulations, directives and standards related to the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, also known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), the Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA), the Computer Security Act of 1987, OMB Circulars A-130 and A-123, and IRM 2.1.10. 4 Overarching Objectives and Tasks

The objective of the MSIX is to provide a successful electronic system for linking existing State migrant student record systems and electronically exchanging timely and relevant migrant
4

Attachment A: PWS

student records to benefit migrant students nationwide. The ability to exchange migrant student records efficiently facilitates the timely enrollment and placement of migrant students by providing better access to basic school enrollment information. An efficient records exchange system benefits highly mobile secondary migrant students by providing and maintaining course credit accrual information necessary for high school graduation. The following overarching objectives are mandated to be accomplished under this contract. a. Obtain under a performance-based arrangement, highly reliable and secure IT managed services and support that meets or exceeds customer requirements and expectations. b. Establish a partner-focused working relationship with Government. c. Establish appropriate and effective incentives that fundamentally align the goals and objectives of the Contractor and Government to ensure superior services are provided. d. Throughout the life of this effort, demonstrate improved performance, reliability, security, and reduced cost of operating MSIX. e. Given the dynamics of the information technology environment, establish a task order arrangement that easily accommodates change (i.e. implement new and innovative technologies). f. Develop and implement operation and maintenance services that support the Department of Educations compliance with Government standards and requirements (e.g., all Federal Government directives and standards related to the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, also known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA), the Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA), the Computer Security Act of 1987, OMB Circulars A-130 and A-123. g. Provide a partnership with team members and/or subcontractors that appears seamless to the Government and that fosters shared accountability and responsibility among all partners. Ideally, subcontracts will also be performance-based. h. Provide timely services to enable OME and MSIX to meet its mission critical requirements with potentially short down times. 4.1 Task 1: Initial Activities

4.1.1 Sub-task 1A: Kick-off Meeting Within five days of contract award the contractor shall conduct a kickoff meeting with the Government to discuss contract objectives and timelines. The contractor shall conduct the kickoff meeting at the Department of Education headquarters in southwest Washington, D.C.

The disaster recovery site is located at the Virtustream facility in Vienna, Virginia. During the first 60 days of performance, implement a disaster/training hosting solution separate from the location of the production facility that best addresses MSIX needs in terms of cost, efficiency and innovation. Take into consideration all relevant costs including equipment, labor and facilities. The contractor may continue operation at the Virtustream facility or choose another location. At the end of 60 days, full functionality should be in place. 4.1.4 Sub-task 1C: Phase-Out Plan An initial phase out plan should be submitted within 90 calendar days prior to the end of the base period. A final phase out plan shall be submitted ninety calendar days prior to the completion of this contract, (including option periods) in order to facilitate a smooth and orderly transfer of contract responsibility to a successor. At this time, management personnel of the incoming workforce may observe operations and performance methods of the incumbent Contractor. This will allow for the orderly turnover of equipment and records and will help to enable continuity of service. The Contractor shall not defer any requirements for the purpose of avoiding responsibility or of transferring such responsibility to the succeeding Contractor. The Contractor shall fully cooperate with the succeeding Contractor and the Government so as not to interfere with their work or duties. 4.2 Task 2: Project Management Support The Contractors project management shall include the detailed planning and coordination and related technical engineering activities to enable the efficient operation and maintenance of MSIX. The Contractor shall provide project management support to promote the optimal use of Contractor resources, performance on this contract, and management controls to enable the Contractors efforts to remain within the budget. The Contractor may also be required to provide assistance to ED in developing strategies to address non-technical concerns for operating a system that is used nationwide. Project management shall consist of: (1) Management of the Contractors activities using industry standard project management processes to initiate, plan, execute, control, and close the project in accordance with the Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) or other industry standards.

The report shall also provide performance measurement status, as required by this contract, and an extract from the risk management repository. Note that Earned Value Management (EVM) reporting is required for all enhancement activities. These enhancement activities will be detailed as separate tasks to this PWS and awarded as needed by the Government. EVM reporting requirements are also detailed in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) subpart 34.2. (3) Management of processes and procedures that demonstrate management controls are in place, used, and quality control is conducted. (4) Management of daily Web site operation. (5) Participation and interface with Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) staff (could be either Government or contracted). ED plans to retain the services of IV&V support to provide oversight, monitoring, and other IV&V activities. The Contractor shall provide full cooperation with IV&V contractor and IV&V activities, including making Contractor staff, documentation, and computer code available, upon mutually agreeable dates, for purposes of this activity. The Contractor shall, upon request from ED, provide advice, recommendations, and strategies to address migrant education concerns. ED and MSIX face many challenges that are not technical; ED may request briefings, white papers, strategy documents, data extracts, and outreach support to the States, as necessary, to promote the successful use of MSIX. It is estimated that five (5) white papers and documents per year and four (4) hours per quarter of briefings will be required. For major system upgrades or enhancements that include equipment and or software changes, the Contractor shall develop and maintain an Integrated Project Schedule. The Project Schedule shall consist of a Microsoft Project file that includes proposed tasks, timelines where needed, start and finish dates for tasks that apply (i.e. equipment refresh, scheduled software upgrades, enhancements and innovations).

Annual growth in the total number of students added will be minimal. It is expected that the number of records in the database will increase by 25% a year. Manage new releases and implementation as they become available. Prepare release notes and updated Test Analysis Reports within 10 business days prior to any new release of MSIX software; Nightly data ingestion (see Attachment H for frequency and volume of files loaded.); and Ensure scalability of records to support increases in student and user record volume.

4.3.2 Sub-task 3B: Legacy Data Ingestion Migrant student data from each state must be loaded into MSIX in order to achieve the goals of the migrant student record exchange initiative. The state data interfaces must first be tested to verify that each state is able to effectively send and receive data with MSIX in the correct format and according to the prescribed procedures. The State Data Ingestion tasks encompass the process to test the state interfaces and load each states migrant student data into MSIX. The Contractor will work with each states Phase I (demographic and enrollment data) technical support contractors to develop and commence execution of a States Assistance Implementation Plan within 90 days after contract award. The Plan will include the costs and schedule for each state and their vendor to modify their existing MSIX interface to provide the required Phase II (Assessment) and Phase III (Course History) data. This data is maintained at the local school district level in many states, so significant analysis may be required by state teams and vendors to determine how current interfaces will need to be modified. For Phases II and III, the data availability is dependent on the state system owners and contractors supporting them (Tromik, MSEDD and others). The MSIX Contractor will continue to support the states ingestion process as it currently functions. Each states interface transmits demographic, enrollment, assessment and course history data. Ingesting the remaining states data is high priority during the base period of the contract. This involves developmental, testing and help desk function support. As states are brought into the MSIX, the contractor will test (or retest in the event of changes to a states current interface) and certify each states interface to validate that it is correctly transmitting all data elements. States will receive funding in the form of grants through ED to facilitate this task. The contractor will be required to provide new testing and deployment of existing MSIX Web Services capability. This includes testing and facilitation of web services for new states that desire this functionality in accordance with the existing Web Services On-boarding document. The existing MSIX web site must comply with the following:  MSIX websites must have a .gov domain name (OMB Memorandum M-05-04).

Enhancements to MSIX are subject to EVM reporting requirements and will be provided on separate task orders to this contract. Examples of enhancements could include changes to the MSIX user interface, additional reporting requirements, studies, analysis or white papers. 4.4 4.4.1 Subtask 4A: MSIX Enhancements

The following enhancements to MSIX are required during the contract Base Period: 1. Create functionality that allows State data administrators to view the actions (e.g. accept or reject) of users in other States when the student resides in their State.
13

Solicitation: ED-ESE-11-R-0035

Attachment A: PWS

2. Create MSIX functionality to verify required conditions before a state user administrator role can be removed or the account be deactivated. 3. Provide linkage from each worklist item to the applicable Data Administrator(s) in another state enabling the person resolving the worklist to call or email that individual if there are questions about the worklist item. Note: This should not be required for Validation worklists as the name and contact information of the person that processed the original worklist item is provided with that list. 4. Streamline the email notification process for MSIX messages. As configured, the current process involves individual e-mail notifications. MSIX E-mail notifications should be grouped together by state.

5. Provide an update to the Search Results page enabling data from all states to be displayed relative to the Student State ID (SSID) selected. Currently, if users click on the MSIX ID located on the Search Results page, the Consolidated and Historical views display data from all states for the selected student. Currently, users click on the SSID in the Search Results page with "Consolidated and Historical" views returning data associated only with the SSID chosen. 6. Enable the presence of a "wait cursor" while the Student Search Result Sorting is in progress. 7. Change the order of the tabs in the student consolidated view to display "Assessments" followed by "Course History." This will align the tabs according to the P2, P3 data structure. The current ordering of tabs is: Demographics, Enrollments, Course History, Assessments and Privacy Act. 8. Include the relevant "Term" (Fall, Spring, Summer) as part of "Course History." As MSIX is currently designed, "Term" not indicated as part of "Course History." The "Course Section" and "Term Type" fields convey this information. This involves creating a new Minimum Data Element (MDE) to indicate "Term" that would associate with "Course History." This new MDE would then be added to the MSIX interface, ETL Process, and Student Views. 9. Create a separate MSIX inbox for student merge notifications. As now configured, emails including private student information are received in the general MSIX inbox.

10. Insert a "Multiple Birth Indicator" on the Worklist. 11. Include Grade information on the Assessment Tab. The interpretation (assessment) provides a more complete picture than the score alone. Including the two together allows the consideration of both as they relate to each other.
14

Solicitation: ED-ESE-11-R-0035

Attachment A: PWS

12. Remove the approval notice for near match records as identified by the automated process. The "Created by" field on the worklist is populated with the "Superuser ID." MSIX currently uses this value to send out the approval notice. Approval notification is not required for merges made from worklist items created by the nightly automated process. 13. Modify the ETL process to accommodate a lag in EDFacts data retrieval. This involves modification of the current ETL code to include the school year as part of the filter for the NCES ID lookup. This process includes the following logic: If the inbound school year equals the current school year then check for the NCES ID in the table. If the value is found, store the corresponding key with the inbound record. Otherwise, accept the inbound data and flag as "not validated" for the current school year. If the inbound school year is greater than or less than the current school year, check for the NCES ID in the table. If the value is found, store the corresponding key with the inbound record, otherwise, mark the record as "unknown/invalid". 14. Add functionality that forwards an email to a user advising that user of the account activation date if that date occurs is in the future. 15. Implement automated vulnerability scanning. Vulnerability scans are currently being run manually. 16. Provide for the ability to display Merge/Split history for a student to indicate when the record was merged or split and when other potential merges or splits were rejected and the reason(s). 4.4.2 Sub-Task 1C Equipment replacement during the first half of Base Period. An equipment refresh is required during the Base Period. A cost estimate for equipment and other direct costs associated with this "refresh" will be required unless an alternative approach such as "Cloud" computing is presented and can be implemented by the end of the Base Period. Provide a transition and cost comparison of associated with leasing or purchasing equipment and provide a justification for the approach selected at the end of the first 6 months of the Base Period. Perform an equipment refresh within 12 months after contract award in accordance with the approved transition plan. A list of equipment is provided at Attachment I. 4.4.3 Sub-Task 4C Analysis of migration to a "Cloud" computing solution for MSIX. An analysis of the feasibility of the utilization of Cloud computing for hosting the MSIX application and database is required during the first quarter (3 months) of the Base
15

Solicitation: ED-ESE-11-R-0035

Attachment A: PWS

Period. If implemented, this would eliminate the need for an equipment refresh during the second half of the Base Period. This analysis should provide a comprehensive evaluation with justification for either using a cloud solution or another approach. This analysis should consider the following: 1. Assessment of the current MSIX infrastructure (application and database) ensuring an in depth understanding of how MSIX works and how users interface with it. 2. A review of EDs goals and objectives for the MSIX technical infrastructure, the current MSIX solution with the various cloud models, an evaluation of the alternative, an assessment of compatibility of models, and a process to develop a recommended path forward as well as a detailed transition plan. 3. Components should be assessed for compatibility with a cloud model, and for those that arent, what steps can be taken to address the lack of compatibility (e.g., redesign\re-architect, use alternative solutions.) 4. Compare the use of private versus community or public clouds and provide information as to the benefits and drawbacks of each. 5. Identify key elements that most lend themselves to migration to a Cloud. 6. Risk analysis addressing loss of access, mitigation of risks associated with data loss, and security. 7. Compliance with federal standards (where applicable) and other regulatory constraints should be addressed. 8. Show how ED business rules are addressed in a Cloud. 9. Unique issues surrounding software licensing in a cloud should be addressed and solutions to licensing complexities proposed. 10. A draft migration plan for moving MSIX to a cloud with least disruption. 4.5 Task 5: Help Desk Support and Trouble Ticket Management The Contractor shall provide full range Help Desk Support and Trouble Ticket Management including, but not limited to:  Maintain readiness to answer telephone calls from end users: o To the extent feasible, resolve customer problems and respond to customer requests while on the telephone with the customer;
16

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP) 1 INTRODUCTION

This quality assurance surveillance plan (QASP) is pursuant to the requirements listed in the performance work statement (PWS) entitled Migrant Student Information Exchange System (MSIX). This plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines the Office of Migrant Education (OME) will use in ensuring the required performance standards or services levels are achieved by the contractor. 1.1 1.1.1 Purpose The purpose of the QASP is to describe the systematic methods used to monitor performance and to identify the required documentation and the resources to be employed. The QASP provides a means for evaluating whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards/quality levels identified in the PWS and the contractor`s Quality Control Plan (QCP), and to ensure that the government pays only for the level of services received. This QASP defines the roles and responsibilities of all members of the integrated project team (IPT), identifies the performance objectives, defines the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor`s performance, describe s quality assurance documentation requirements, and describes the analysis of quality assurance monitoring results. Performance Management Approach The PWS structures the acquisition around what service or quality level is required, as opposed to how the contractor should perform the work (i.e., results, not compliance). This QASP will define the performance management approach taken by OME to monitor and manage the contractor`s performance to ensure the expected outcomes or performance objectives communicated in the PWS are achieved. Performance management rests on developing a capability to review and analyze information generated through performance assessment. The ability to make decisions based on the analysis of performance data is the cornerstone of performance management; this analysis yields information that indicates whether expected outcomes for the project are being achieved by the contractor. Performance management represents a significant shift from the more traditional quality assurance (QA) concepts in several ways. Performance management focuses on assessing whether outcomes are being achieved and to what extent. This approach migrates away from scrutiny of compliance with the processes and practices used to achieve the outcome. A performance-based approach enables the contractor to play a large role in how the work is performed, as long as the proposed processes are within the stated constraints. The only exceptions to process reviews are those required by law (federal, state, and local) and compelling business situations, such as safety and health. A results focus provides the contractor flexibility to continuously improve and innovate over the course of the contract as long as the critical outcomes expected are being achieved and/or the desired performance levels are being met.

1.3 1.3.1

Performance Management Strategy The contractor is responsible for the quality of all work performed. The contractor measures that quality through the contractor`s own Quality Control Plan (QCP). The QCP is work output, not workers, and therefore includes all work performed under this contract regardless of whether the work is performed by contractor employees or by subcontractors. The contractor`s QCP will set forth the staffing and procedures for self-inspecting the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements in the PWS. The contractor will develop and implement a performance management system with processes to assess and report its performance to the designated government representative. The contractor`s QCP will set forth the staffing and procedures for self-inspecting the quality, timeliness, responsiveness, client/customer satisfaction, and other performance requirements in the PWS. This QASP enables the government to take advantage of the contractor`s QC program.

1.3.2 The government representative(s) will monitor performance and review performance reports furnished by the contractor to determine how the contractor is performing against communicated performance objectives. The government will make determination regarding incentives based on performance measurement metric data and notify the contractor of those decisions. The contractor will be responsible for making required changes in processes and practices to ensure performance is managed effectively. 2 2.1 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES The Contracting Officer

The contracting officer (CO) is responsible for monitoring contract compliance, contract administration, and cost control and for resolving any differences between the observations documented by the "Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)" or "Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) and the contractor. The CO will designate one full-time COR, as the government authority for performance management. The number of additional representatives serving as technical inspectors include the MSIX Project Manager (if different from the COR), the QAE and MSIX Customers. The CO shall approve any revision to the QASP processes or standards. 2.2 The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)

The COR is designated in writing by the CO to act as his or her authorized and will serve as the first line manager of all tasks issued under this contract. The CO may delegate many of the daily contract administration duties to the COR and QAEs. However, certain contractual actions such as negotiation and issuance of contract modifications, resolution of Contractor claims and disputes, issuance of cure notices, issuance of show-cause letters, termination of the contract, and contract close-out functions are retained by the CO. If modifications to the contract are necessary, the COR will assist the CO in preparing and negotiating the modifications. Administrative actions such as invoice approval and issuance of Contractor deficiency reports may be, and normally shall be, delegated by the CO to the COR. The COR will have the responsibility for completing QA monitoring forms used to document the inspection and evaluation of the contractor`s work performance. Government surveillance may occur under the inspection of services clause for any service relating to the contract. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the government`s behalf. Any differe nces in contract interpretation or conditions shall be referred to the CO for action. COR limitations are contained in the written appointment letter.

2.3

Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE)

The QAEs play a key role in contract administration because they serve as the on-site representative of the CO and the COR. The QAE performs the actual contract surveillance and reports to the COR. The QAE completes the documentation as discussed in paragraph 5, Quality Assurance Documentation of this plan. Some of the key contract administration duties of QAEs include, but are not limited to, the following:  Complete surveillance as required by this QASP and the specific task, and make recommendations to the COR and CO for issuance of deficiency reports or letters of commendation;  Make recommendations to the COR for the acceptance or rejection of completed work and for administrative actions based on unsatisfactory work or non-performed work;  Assist the COR in identifying necessary changes to the task, preparing ED cost and staffing requirements estimates, conducting quality assurance Contractor meetings, approving submittals of effort and reports, and maintaining work files;  Promptly furnish the COR with any requests for changes, deviations, or waivers to the task with justifications/rationale. The QAEs only have the authority delegated to them in writing by the COR or the CO. They have no authority to direct or to allow the Contractor to deviate from contract requirements, including changes that would impact task costs or schedule and deliveries. The QAEs have no authority to direct or interfere with the methods of performance by the Contractor or to issue directions, including change orders, to any of the Contractor`s personnel. These actions are reserved for the CO or to the COR. The QAEs will use the documentation tools discussed in Paragraph 5 when inspecting the requirements of this contract, or such other forms as are specified in the task or by the COR. The Surveillance Guide (SG) will contain a specific task to be checked and whether the inspection results in a Contractor rating of Acceptable, Marginally Acceptable or Unsatisfactory performance; the specifics shall be included in the task. Overall guidance is also provided by the Inspection and Acceptance clauses in the contract.

2.4

Clients/Customers

Clients consist of Government (ED) employees (i.e. COR, other program staff). Customers are a diversified group of school administrators using the MSIX and are located throughout the nation and within ED. Customers assist the QAEs and COR in conducting quality assurance by providing information on Contractor performance through a Customer Comment/Feedback Record, Attachment 2. The information gained from the Customer Comment/Feedback process may be used in conjunction with other methods of observation to rate the performance of the Contractor. This information will be made available to the Contractor periodically and more often if the Contractor is not meeting its performance requirements.

IDENTIFICATION OF REQUIRED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS/QUALITY LEVELS

The required performance standards and/or quality levels are included in the PWS and in Attachment 1, Performance Requirements Summary. If the contractor meets the required service or performance level, it will be paid the amount agreed on in the contract. Failure to meet the required service or performance level will result in a reduction in payment on the invoice covering the performance period in question. In the case of unsatisfactory performance, payment of the invoice may be withheld. 4 4.1 METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE Surveillance Techniques

In an effort to minimize the performance management burden, simplified surveillance methods shall be used by the government to evaluate contractor performance when appropriate. The primary methods of surveillance are:     Random monitoring 100% Inspection Periodic Inspection ­ Typically performed on a monthly basis. Customer Comment and Feedback--obtained from surveys and questionnaires submitted by users.

4.1.2

Random Sampling Random sampling evaluation is a quality assurance method designed to evaluate some, but not all, of a specific contract requirement. This method, based on statistical principles, estimates the Contractor`s overall level of performance for a given contract require ment based on a representative sample drawn from a population. Random sampling is most often used when the number of occurrences of a service is very high. 4.1.2.1 Application of Random Sampling The random sampling procedures are based on those set by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The random sampling procedures consider the maximum allowable deviation from the required performance standard, the level (intensity) of the evaluation effort, and the population size. There are two ways of applying random sampling for QA surveillance. The first is used only for performance evaluation and allows deductions to be taken only for observed defects; the second is random sampling for performance evaluation and deduction projection (also called extrapolated deductions), which allows deductions against the whole population based on the inspection of the sample. Problems often arise when inspectors fail to follow random sampling procedures precisely. 4.1.2.2 Performance Standards Performance standards may be specified as percentages or absolute numbers.

Page 4 of 8

Office of Migrant Education-MSIX

4.1.2.3 Evaluation Procedures Random sampling is based solely on a statistical analysis whereby a conclusion is drawn about a population based on a randomly selected sample of that population. For the conclusion to be valid, the sample selected must be representative of the population. A truly representative sample can be achieved by ensuring that the sample is selected randomly and the size of the sample is sufficient. A conclusion about Contractor performance can then be made based on the representative sample drawn. 4.1.3 100 Percent Inspection The 100 percent inspection method requires complete inspection of a contract requirement. 4.1.3.1 Application of 100 Percent Inspection These inspections should be used for requirements that are especially critical or where there is some reason for suspecting that the performance standard is not being met (and therefore, should be more closely monitored). A 100 percent inspection approach should also be used for monitoring scheduled contract requirements (such as one-time deliverables, scheduled submissions, and infrequently identified requirements). Although 100 percent inspections are the most costly, they provide positive proof of delivery of critical requirements. Evaluation schedules for 100 percent inspections will be prepared each month. 4.1.3.2 Performance Standards The performance standards may be stated as either percentages or absolute numbers. 4.1.3.3 Evaluation Procedures Observed defects for a service monitored by 100 percent inspection is compared to the performance standard. 4.1.4 Periodic Inspection Periodic inspection, or planned sampling, provides a systematic way of looking at service outputs and forming conclusions abo ut the Contractor`s level of performance in accordance with a planned schedule of surveillance. Evaluation by periodic inspection is designed to inspect some part; but not all of the products and services being monitored. 4.1.4.1 Application of Periodic Inspection Specific contract requirements that are to be monitored are selected for evaluation prior to their scheduled accomplishment. Periodic inspection differs from random sampling in the way in which samples are selected ­ periodic inspection sample selection is based on some subjective rationale and sample sizes are usually arbitrarily determined. With this type of evaluation, the Contractor knows that work performed in specific functions or selected locations is more likely to be monitored than work in other areas or locations, and the QAEs are able to direct efforts to those areas where inspections are most needed. Periodic inspection, as compared with random sampling, provides a less sound statistical means of making comparisons between observed and overall performance, and the Contractor`s overall lev el of performance. Periodic inspection does not accurately determine the Contractor`s overall performance. Periodic inspection is generally used in
Page 5 of 8

Contract #___

Office of Migrant Education-MSIX

two ways. First, it can provide a one-time subjective evaluation of Contractor performance. Second, it can be used to detect a change in the Contractor`s level of performance (e.g., trend analysis). This method requires that the sample selection criteria be well documented and consistently applied from period to period, and that there are no other intervening factors. The cost of periodic inspections varies with the level of inspections. Such latitude is important to manage limited resources and focus inspections on known or suspected problems areas. 4.1.4.2 Performance Standards Performance standards are usually stated in terms of the number of defects detected per time period, e.g., three times per month. There is no specific relationship between sample size and performance standard; however, when the performance standard is expressed as a percentage, it is recommended that the maximum sample size be chosen such that one defect does not exceed the performance standard. 4.1.4.3 Evaluation Procedures The levels of evaluation appropriate for periodic inspection are judgmental. In order to perform trend analysis from periodic inspection, criteria for sample selection should be applied consistently from period to period. To ensure valid results, the QAEs will use periodic inspection evaluation sheets and follow a detailed inspection schedule. Schedules may be developed monthly to coincide with the Contractor`s monthly schedule of work, and regularly updated after receiving the Contractor`s definitive weekly schedule. Observed defects for services monitored by periodic inspection will be totaled at the end of each month. For each service, the total number of defects will be compared to the performance standard. 4.2 Client/Customer Feedback

The contractor is expected to establish and maintain professional communication between its employees and customers. The primary objective of this communication is customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is the most significant external indicator of the success and effectiveness of all services provided and can be measured through customer feedback in the form of written surveys or validated customer complaints. Performance management drives the contractor to be client/customer focused through initially and internally addressing customer complaints and investigating the issues and/or problems but the customer always has the option to communicate complaints to the COR, as opposed to the contractor. Customer complaints, to be considered valid, must set forth clearly and in writing. It must contain the detailed nature of the complaint, must be signed, and must be forwarded to the COR. The COR will accept those customer complaints and investigate using the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form, identified in Attachment 3. Customer feedback is also obtained either from the results of formal customer satisfaction surveys or from random customer complaints. 4.3 Acceptable Quality Levels

The acceptable quality levels (AQLs) included in Attachment 1, Performance Requirements Summary Table, for contractor performance are structured to allow the contractor to manage how the work is performed while providing negative incentives for performance shortfalls. Levels of performance are keyed to the relative importance of the task to the overall operation of MSIX.

QUALITY ASSURANCE DOCUMENTATION The Performance Management Feedback Loop

The performance management feedback loop begins with the communication of expected outcomes. Performance standards are expressed in the PWS and assessed using the performance monitoring techniques shown in the PRS, Attachment 1. 5.2 Monitoring Forms

The government`s QA surveillance, accomplished by the COR, will be reported using the monitoring forms in Attachments 2 and 3. The forms, when completed, will document the government`s assessment of the contractor`s performance under the contract to ensure that the required quality levels are being achieved. 5.2.1 6 6.1 6.1.1 The COR will retain a copy of all completed QA surveillance forms.

ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE ASSESSMENT Determining Performance ED shall use the monitoring methods cited to determine whether the performance AQLs have been met. If the contractor has not met the minimum requirements, it may be asked to develop a corrective action plan to show how and by what date it intends to bring performance up to the required levels. Failure to meet the AQL may result in a deduction (disincentive) from the invoice covering that period of performance. Reporting At the end of each month, the QAE, will prepare a written report for the COR summarizing the overall results of the quality assurance surveillance of the contractor`s performance. This written report, which includes the contractor`s submitted Monthly Status Report and the completed quality assurance monitoring forms, Attachment 3, will become part of the QA documentation. It will enable the government to demonstrate whether the contractor is meeting the stated objectives and/or performance standards, including cost/technical/scheduling objectives. Acceptable Performance Acceptable performance is the result of the Contractor fully meeting the performance requirement being inspected. ED may reduce its level of surveillance when the MSIX PM determines there are very few or no deficiencies and the Contractor performance has met the required acceptability levels shown in the PRS and all deliverables are submitted on-time and complete.

6.2.2

Office of Migrant Education-MSIX

6.2.3

Marginally Acceptable Performance When the Contractor`s performance is marginally acceptable, performance meets the specified standard and the allowable number of defects or AQL in most areas. There are no critical areas where the AQL is lower than defined in the PRS. Deliverables may be late or incomplete, but have been submitted. The invoice is authorized for payment at a reduced amount (disincentive of 10%). The QAE may suggest to the MSIX COR that an increased level of surveillance be used for individual deliverables or services that show defect rates below the minimum performance standards. The Contractor will be notified by the MSIX PM when performance is marginal, or approaching an unacceptable level in any area.

6.2.4

Unsatisfactory Performance When the performance standards for services /deliverables have not been met, the Contractor`s performance is unsatisfactory, and is, therefore, unacceptable. The following responses are available to the MSIX PM regarding that task/subtask:    The CO and/or MSIX PM meet with the Contractor to discuss discrepancies, trends, and intended corrective measures; The level of surveillance is increased until the Contractor demonstrates acceptable performance over a period of time; The CO issues a Contract Discrepancy Report (Attachment 12) for each service that does not meet its performance standard;

Should deficiencies be significant and affect multiple tasks/subtasks, a CO action such as a Cure` notice may be appropriate. 6.3 6.3.1 Reviews and Resolution The COR may require the contractor`s project manager, or a designated alternate, to meet with the COR and other government IPT personnel as deemed necessary to discuss performance evaluation. The COR will define a frequency of in-depth reviews with the contractor, including appropriate self-assessments by the contractor; however, if the need arises, the contractor will meet with the COR as often as required or per the contractor`s request. The agenda of the reviews may include:      6.3.2 Monthly performance assessment data and trend analysis Issues and concerns of both parties Projected outlook for upcoming months and progress against expected trends, including a corrective action plan analysis Recommendations for improved efficiency and/or effectiveness Issues arising from the performance monitoring processes

The COR or QAE must coordinate and communicate with the contractor to resolve issues and concerns regarding marginal or unacceptable performance.

The COR and contractor should jointly formulate tactical and long-term courses of action. Decisions regarding changes to metrics, thresholds, or service levels should be clearly documented. Changes to service levels, procedures, and metrics will be incorporated as a contract modification by the CO. Page 8 of 8

Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) Matrix
The PRS is essentially a tool that provides a convenient description of performance standards and assessments and is the central focus of the Government`s quality assurance surveillance activities. To improve performance flexibility and to increase opportunities for use of innovative and/or cost-efficient practices, the PRS will be further developed and refined during contract performance. The Contractor shall participate in this effort. During the first six months of contract performance (estimated) August 2011-December 2011, the Contractor shall partner with the Government to produce a revised version of the PRS based on the concepts described in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) document entitled, Seven Steps to Performance-Based Services Acquisition. The contractor shall participate in the partnering activities as described below: (1) Partnering session, 1-1/2 days. Participants shall include key Government and Contractor personnel responsible for contract performance oversight and results. At the minimum, Contractor attendees shall include the on-site Project Manager, the Quality Control Manager, and a corporate representative. Government participants will include personnel from the Contracting Office and Office of Migrant Education (OME). The purpose of the partnering session is to establish the ground-rules and objectives for revisions to the PRS. The session will be arranged by the Government and will take place at OME offices during the first month of contract performance August 2011. (2) Regularly scheduled follow-up meetings to continue development of a revised PRS. The Contractor`s participation will include providing continuous performance data and statistics routinely generated and reported during the first six months of contract performance; assistance in analyzing data for use and application in the PRS; and recommending alternative practices and approaches to tasks and operations, based on commercial standards and performance measurements. (3) The revised PRS will replace the current PRS no later than 120 calendar days prior to the end of the base year or as specified by the Contracting Officer. The offeror is encouraged to identify elements of the PRS that provide meaningful monitoring of performance and solutions for not meeting the acceptable quality level. The offeror may propose additions to this matrix.

8. Analysis of Results: At the end of the month, the QAE will use the Evaluation Summary
Worksheet to summarize all the information and compute the number of defects for each performance standard. The QAE will determine if the Contractor`s performance for the specific standard is satisfactory or unsatisfactory given the number of mistakes or omissions. If one or more standards are unsatisfactory, further evaluation is required to determine if the Contractor's overall performance is unsatisfactory. The QAE will assess the results of each performance standard, taking into consideration the importance and criticality of each in relation to the total service being evaluated. The QAE will document the overall evaluation for the service on the Evaluation Summary Worksheet.

9. Suggested Action: The Contractor should be notified monthly as to whether work
performance has been satisfactory or not. If the Contractor`s performance was unsatisfactory, a Contract Discrepancy Report should be issued and other actions, such as increasing the level of surveillance, may be considered.

 Introduction & Overview

 Purpose

This Functional Requirements Document (FRD) details the requirements that will serve as the foundation for the U.S. Department of Education’s (ED) Migrant Student Information Exchange (MSIX) initiative.  The functional requirements listed in this document will provide a source for communicating business objectives for MSIX, the intended behavior of MSIX, and will serve as the baseline for the design of the MSIX solution.

Background

The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001 mandated that ED ensure that all students have equal access to education and that ED promote educational excellence throughout the nation.  The Office of Migrant Education (OME), part of ED’s Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE), is responsible for administering the Migrant Education Program (MEP).  The MEP supports State Educational Agencies (SEAs) by providing funding to help SEAs establish or improve educational programs for migrant students.

Section 1308(b) of the NCLB requires the OME to assist States in developing effective methods for electronically exchanging student records amongst States; and, to determine and accurately account for the number of migratory children in each state.  OME established the MSIX initiative to satisfy these requirements and support their goals for the MEP through MSIX.

The MSIX requirements were initially developed during two user group working sessions held in  in 2004.  

Document Scope

This FRD details the baseline requirements provided to Deloitte Consulting LLP (the Deloitte Project Team) by ED for the MSIX initiative.

The Interface Control Specification (ICS) and System Requirement Specification (SRS) documents will provide details on the specific system requirements including hardware.  The date of final delivery for both ICS and SRS is January 5, 2007.  The System Security Plan will address ED’s System of Records Privacy Act.



Please refer to the Requirements Management Plan for details on Deloitte’s approach to managing requirements.  Please refer to the Personnel and Staffing Plan for details around resource allocation tasks.  Please refer to the Contractor Project Management Plan for details around cost allocations.

Assumptions

The following assumptions have been made for the MSIX initiative.  These assumptions were previously documented in the MSIX User Requirements Document and MSIX Project Management Plan (November 3, 2006):

MSIX shall be accessible to users via the web.

System response requirements assume normal Internet connectivity and a typical response time available via the Internet; this accounts for various methods of access (e.g. dial-up, broadband and high capacity digital access (T-1 or greater)).

Data transfer will comply with the provided XML format.

State MEPs will continue to use their own systems for collecting and updating migrant student information. 

MSIX shall contain all Minimum Data Elements (MDE).  The MDEs are a proposed set of data elements that each state shall be required to collect for the purposes of the electronic transfer of migrant student information and the requirements that States shall meet for immediate access to such information.  

Secure access to MSIX shall be available to all eligible users throughout the .  

MSIX shall be developed to allow for minimum disruption and changes to existing migrant record systems.

MSIX Requirements.  The Deloitte Project Team will validate these requirements for the purposes of obtaining clarity where necessary.  Any changes required by ED to these requirements that significantly impact currently defined MSIX schedule or budget may necessitate revising the MSIX contract scope. 

Deliverables.  The Deloitte Project Team will produce the contractually documented set of deliverables.  These deliverables will be provided on or before the contractual due date. 

Timely Reviews.  Deliverable review timeline is followed and formal review processes are clearly defined.  The Department of Education and Independent Verification & Validation () staff will provide timely review comments of all draft deliverables (generally 5 business days, unless agreed otherwise).

Project Scope.  Project scope is limited to the set of requirements that have been predefined by the Department of Education.

User groups and key personnel access.  The Deloitte Project Team will have access to user groups and ED personnel.

Conflict of interest.  Contractor shall not be directed or required to perform any effort (including “Unilateral Un-priced Orders”) when performing the effort would entail an organizational conflict of interest or other business conflict. 

Proprietary technology and data.  The Deloitte Project Team does not anticipate the delivery of any pre-existing or proprietary technical data or computer software in connection with its performance of the contract.  If, however, and to the extent that the Deloitte Project Team delivers any of its pre-existing or proprietary technical data or computer software in connection with this opportunity, such technical data and computer software will be delivered to the Department of Education and the Government with restricted/limited rights.  Prior to such delivery of pre-existing or proprietary technical data or computer software, the Deloitte Project Team will provide notice to the Department of Education and will appropriately legend such technical data and computer software.  Moreover, in the performance of the services, the Deloitte Project Team may utilize certain pre-existing or proprietary technical data or computer software.  The Deloitte Project Team will not transfer any right, title or interest in such technical data or computer software to the Department of Education or the Government as a result of this use.  

Certification and accreditation.  ED requires certification and accreditation of the General Support System (GSS) and the Major Application (MA).  The ED Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO)/Information Assurance Team will handle the MSIX certification and accreditation.

Risk assessment.  The ED OCIO/Information Assurance Team will procure the independent resources to complete the MSIX risk assessment(s).

Contingencies and disaster recovery. ED will review and approve the approach for contingencies and disaster recovery.

MSIX is not the system of record for migrant student records.

Students and parents will have access to data in MSIX through authorized MSIX users.

Access to MSIX data is limited by role.

MSIX will be designed in a way that is minimally invasive to state MEP component systems.

Constraints

The following MSIX initiative constraints were previously documented in the MSIX User Requirements Document and MSIX Project Management Plan (November 3, 2006):

MSIX architecture shall link to existing systems. MSIX shall be able to link existing migrant student information systems previously developed by the states regardless of their technical architecture. 

MSIX access for non-MEP system users. MSIX shall allow registered, eligible users who do not use an existing State MEP database to query MSIX for information on migrant students who have entered their state.

Implementation schedule.  The schedule will not be impeded by unforeseen circumstances and will consist of two pilots, at six and nine months, and a nationwide rollout at 12 months after contract award.

Communication.  Maintain an open communication channel amongst all project teams. 

Certification and accreditation.  Availability of resources from the ED OCIO/Information Assurance Team to execute the MSIX certification and accreditation.  The ED OCIO/Information Assurance Team will not approve processing of "live" data in any environment until it has been accredited.

Security controls.  Security controls requiring "organization defined" parameters must be reviewed and approved by the ED OCIO/Information Assurance Team.

Structure

The remainder of the FRD is structured as follows:

Section 2, Developing Requirements, provides information as to how the requirements were captured and addressed.

Section 3, MSIX Users, provides information about the user types and their role functions.

Section 4, Initiative Overview, provides information on the MSIX release, including goals, objectives, and a summary of the requirements’ functional areas.

Section 5, Functional Requirements, details the MSIX functional requirements.

Section 6, Inconsistent Requirements, details the requirements that need to be further discussed due to inconsistencies. 

Section 7, Reworded Requirements, details the requirements that contained trivial discrepancies have therefore have been slightly altered.



Developing Requirements

The requirements detailed in this FRD were provided to the Deloitte Project Team by ED in the MSIX User Requirements Document.  ED facilitated the identification of the baseline requirements during user group meetings, State Information Technology (IT) meetings and visits, vendor meetings, discussions with OME and State Directors, and recommendations from the MSIX acquisition support team.  The baseline requirements have been documented and addressed in the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) due on January 5, 2007.  

Additional requirements may be identified during the various phases of the MSIX initiative through user group meetings and interviews, State IT meetings and visits, vendor meetings, discussions with OME and State Directors, and recommendations from the MSIX support team.  These requirements will be captured and documented in the RTM after approval by the Change Control Board (CCB) processes (as appropriate).  The sources of the additional requirements will also be captured to specify the manner in which they were identified.

MSIX Users

The MSIX users include ED, OME, and the States’ Migrant Education Programs. OME is responsible for MSIX funding, however MSIX will be developed substantially to benefit the State’s Migrant Education Programs.  OME, in consultation with the States, will provide final acceptance of MSIX capability.  MSIX data will be accessible to various user types based on how they will use the system.

Table 3.0-1: MSIX Users

Initiative Overview

4.1	Goals and Objectives

ED has established the following goals and objectives for the MSIX initiative.  The requirements detailed in this document support these goals and objectives:

Goal 1:  Create an electronic exchange for the transfer of migrant student education and health data amongst the States.

Objective 1.1:  Design, develop, and build the Migrant Student Information Exchange.

Objective 1.2:  Efficiently collect and maintain complete and accurate migrant student education and health data needed for the purpose of record exchange.

Objective 1.3:  Provide users with a consolidated migrant student record in a timely manner in order to facilitate enrollment, placement, and accrual of credits for migrant students.

Objective 1.4:  Reduce the burden of collecting, maintaining, and exchanging migrant student records.

Goal 2:  Promote the use of Migrant Student Information Exchange. 

Objective 2.1:  Conduct consultation with States in the design, development, and implementation of the MSIX.

Objective 2.2:  Disseminate information on the requirements, availability, and benefits of the MSIX to prospective users.

Objective 2.3:  Provide training and help desk support to data users and providers.

Goal 3:  Ensure the use of the consolidated migrant student record for the purposes of enrollment, placement, and accrual of credit for migrant students in school and migrant education projects.

Objective 3.1:  Monitor compliance with records exchange requirements for the production of the consolidated migrant student records.    

Objective 3.2:  Monitor the use of the consolidated student record for the intended purposes of school enrollment, placement and accrual of credits. 

Objective 3.3:  Provide best practices, incentives, and penalties to continuously encourage and expand the use of the consolidated record.

Goal 4:  Produce national data on the migrant population.

Objective 4.1: Provide the stakeholders with census data and statistics on unduplicated national migrant population.

Objective 4.2:  Use unduplicated data for the generation of accurate, consistent child counts.  

4.2	Scope Summary

MSIX will support queries to a source that stores migrant student data. This data will be imported periodically from state migrant student databases.  MSIX will also provide a secure access that will enable States to exchange student’s MDE’s for the purposes of enrollment, grade/course placement, and credit accrual.  The scope of this document does not include allocation of requirements to a specified pilot (or phase).  The pilot phase where a specified requirement is addressed will be specified in the RTM.  Requirements on hardware were not specified by ED; therefore no specifics on hardware requirements are discussed in this document.

H. 5 307-15 WITHHOLDING OF CONTRACT PAYMENTS - SECURITY (JUN 2006)

Notwithstanding any other payment provisions of this contract, failure of the contractor to submit required forms, responses or reports when due; failure to perform or deliver required work, supplies, or services; or, failure to meet any of the requirements of the contract, to include all requirements as specified in Clause 307-13 Department Security Requirements, will result in the withholding of payments under this contract in such amounts as the contracting officer deems appropriate, unless the failure arises out of causes beyond the control, and without the fault of negligence, of the contractor, as defined by the clause entitled "Excusable Delays or Default", as applicable. The Government shall promptly notify the contractor of its intention to withhold payment of any invoice or voucher submitted. Payment will be withheld until the failure is cured, a new delivery schedule is agreed upon, or payment is made as part of a termination settlement. H. 6 307-17 CONFLICT OF INTEREST (AUG 2007)

(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, has certified that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest), (or apparent conflict of interest) for the organization or any of its staff, and that
PAGE 12 OF 45 ED-ESE-11-R-0035

the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: 1. Unequal access to information - a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. 2. Biased ground rules - a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract, 3. Impaired objectivity - a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; - significant connections to teaching methodologies that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services; or - significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property or services. Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) of interest regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest), including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, Section 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government. The Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (D) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. (E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E). H. 7 307-19 REDACTED PROPOSALS (DECEMBER 1998)

The contractor shall provide a redacted copy of its successful technical proposal to the Contracting Officer within five (5) days after contract award. The redacted proposal shall be suitable for release by the Government under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The redacted proposal shall be submitted in an electronic format that is readable by Microsoft Office applications. H. 8 307-2 KEY PERSONNEL DESIGNATION (MARCH 1985)

That is, an individual is prohibited from receiving double payment for any given period of work. H. 10 307-5 PAYMENT OF TRAVEL EXPENSES AND FEES FOR ED EMPLOYEES (MARCH 1985)

The Contractor shall not use any contract funds, or funds from other sources, to pay the travel expenses of, or a fee to, ED employees for lectures, attending program functions, or any other activities in connection with this contract. H. 11 307-6 POST EMPLOYMENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST (MARCH 1985)

The contractor certifies that in developing a proposal in response to the solicitation for this contract, it has not utilized the services of any former Education Department (ED) employee who, while working for the Government, participated personally and substantially in, or

was officially responsible for, the development or drafting of the solicitation for this contract. The contractor further certifies

Payment to the GPO shall be made directly by the Department and charged to the Contract. H. 13 311-5 FORMS CLEARANCE PROCESS (MARCH 1986)

Reference is made to the General Provision entitled "Paperwork Reduction Act." If the contractor has proposed the use of any plan,

Those should be expected to take at
PAGE 14 OF 45 ED-ESE-11-R-0035

least 120 days together. Offerors' proposals shall accordingly reflect that 120 day period in proposal timelines if the Paperwork Reduction Act is applicable. H. 14 316-1 ACCESSIBILITY OF SOFTWARE (OCTOBER 1999)

The Department of Education (ED) considers universal accessibility to information a priority for all its employees and external customers, including individuals with disabilities. Under Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d,as amended), ED must ensure the accessibility of its programs and activities, specifically its obligation to acquire and use accessible electronic and information technology. ED maintains the manual, "Requirements for Accessible Software Design," to convey the accessibility

needs of the Department to the developers and suppliers of computer applications. To comply with the provisions of this

clause, the contractor may use the edition of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design" in effect at the date of award of this contract or any more recent edition. A copy of the most recent edition of the manual may be found at http://www.ed.gov/fund/contract/apply/clibrary/software.html (a) Software delivered to or developed for ED--Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this clause, all software delivered to or developed for ED, under this contract, for use by ED's employees or external customers must meet all the requirements of the ED manual "Requirements for Accessible Software Design." However, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause, the contracting officer may waive a particular requirement of the ED Manual, provided that ED's use of the software will meet the requirements of Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. sections 794 and 794d, as amended). (b) Software enhanced or modified for ED--Any enhancements and other modifications, made under this contract to software for use by ED's employees or external customers, are subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this clause, regardless of where or how the software was first developed. Except as otherwise specified elsewhere in the contract schedule, the contractor is only required to ensure that enhancements or modifications (not other, preexisting features or components) of the software fully comply with the accessibility requirements of paragraph (a). However, the contractor is encouraged point out any preexisting features or components that do not meet accessibility requirements and to suggest solutions to ensure the software
PAGE 15 OF 45 ED-ESE-11-R-0035

As used in this provision-- "Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables. "Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means-- (1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and (2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinitedelivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules). (b) The offeror [ ] has [ ] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000. (c) If the offeror checked "has" in paragraph (b) of this provision, the offeror represents, by submission of this offer, that the information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the following information: (1) Whether the offeror, and/or any of its principals, has or has not, within the last five years, in connection with the award to or performance by the offeror of a Federal contract or grant, been the subject of a proceeding, at the Federal or State level that resulted in any of the following dispositions: (i) In a criminal proceeding, a conviction. (ii) In a civil proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in the payment of a monetary fine, penalty, reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more. (iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in-- (A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or (B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000. (iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision. (2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence. (d) The offeror shall enter the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov (see 52.204-7). "Principal" means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). (End of provision) K. 2 307-17 CONFLICT OF INTEREST (AUG 2007)

(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, has certified that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest), (or apparent conflict of interest) for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: 1. Unequal access to information - a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. 2. Biased ground rules - a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract, 3. Impaired objectivity - a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal
PAGE 24 OF 45 ED-ESE-11-R-0035

funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; - significant connections to teaching methodologies that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services; or - significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property or services. Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) of interest regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest), including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, Section 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government.

(E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E). K. 3 307-17a CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (AUG 2007)

(A) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: 1. Unequal access to information # a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. 2. Biased ground rules # a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract, 3. Impaired objectivity # a potential contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person's objectivity: - financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; - significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property or services; or - significant identification
PAGE 25 OF 45 ED-ESE-11-R-0035

with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property or services. Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause , the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (B) The contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (C) Remedies - The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the Contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of Title 31, U.S. Code, Section 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government. The Contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (D) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. (E) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (E). Conflict of Interest Certification The Offeror, _______________________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. ____________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The Offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government's satisfaction, such Conflict of Interest (or apparent conflict of interest).

(a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have /_/ have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving
PAGE 27 OF 45 ED-ESE-11-R-0035

stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision. (D) Have /_/, have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ## 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ## 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ## 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has /_/ has not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror#s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

After the presentation there shall be a break, during which the SSEB shall develop questions regarding the presentation. Following the break, offerors shall answer questions from the SSEB. The time required for questions and answers shall be in addition to the offeror's three (3) hour presentation. c. SLIDES FOR ORAL PRESENTATIONS Offerors must submit (6) copies of the slides, on 8 1/2 by 11-inch paper that shall be used during the oral presentations. Offerors may not change their slides after the submission. The purpose of this restriction is to reassure offerors with regard to the integrity of the oral presentation process. The maximum number of slides an offeror may use is limited to sixty (60). The Department of Education shall not evaluate the slides as stand-alone documents. The slides are intended to be strictly visual aids for the oral presentation. What the presenters say shall take precedence over what is contained on the slides. 7. SOURCE SELECTION DECISION ED will make an award to the Contractor whose offer conforms to the solicitation, has no deficiencies (as defined in FAR 15.001) and is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For this solicitation, Technical Capability is more important than any of the other five factors. Technical Capability, Management Approach, Teaming/Partnering Plan, Quality Control, and Past Performance Experience when combined, are significantly more important than Price. As the technical factors become more equal amongst offerors, then price shall become a more significant factor.

SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M. 1 1. Evaluation Factors for Award

EVALUATION FACTORS

a. Evaluation of all offers will be made in accordance with the criteria outlined in this section. Proposals will be evaluated against the Government's following factors listed in descending order of importance. Technical Capability, Management Approach, Teaming/Partnering Plan, Quality Control, and Past Performance Experience when combined, are significantly more important than Price. As the technical factors become more equal amongst offerors, then price shall become a more significant factor. Factor 1: Technical Capability Factor 2: Management Approach Factor 3: Teaming/Partnering Plan Factor 4: Quality Control Factor 5: Past Performance Experience Factor 6: Price b. The Government will evaluate the offerors' capability through the utilization of both the written proposal and other written information and oral presentations. The Government will evaluate and assign a qualitative rating to the Technical Capability and Management Approach factors and sub-factors for each offeror's proposal. In addition, the Government will evaluate the risks associated with the offeror's technical proposal and assign a proposal risk rating. The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance and assign a performance risk rating. c. Factors:

Factor 1: Technical Capability: The evaluation of the Technical Capability factor will be a composite evaluation using all of the sub-factors associated with this factor, and will assess the extent to which an offeror's proposal demonstrates a sound, practical methodology for meeting the overall requirements associated with the PWS. The Technical Capability factor and each of its sub-factors will receive an overall adjectival and proposal risk assessment rating. The Technical Capability Factor is subdivided into the following five sub-factors of equal importance: Sub-Factor 1 - Technical Understanding: The offeror will demonstrate in the written proposal and oral presentation an understanding of the work. In making the evaluation, the Government will consider an offeror's knowledge of the PWS in terms of the concept, purpose, importance, inherent problems and ideas for solutions. Sub-Factor 2 - Soundness of Approach: Proposal describes the proposed approach to comply with each of the requirements specified in the PWS. The proposal is consistent with the stated goals and objectives. The proposed approach is well documented and ensures the achievement of timely and acceptable performance in all task areas. Sub-Factor 3 - Customer Support: Proposal describes their knowledge and experience providing wellreceived and successful customer support to the migrant education community on a local, state or federal level. Knowledge of challenges in the migrant community for exchanging student records and implementing technology to support the Migrant Education Program objectives will be evaluated. Sub-Factor 4 - Equipment Replacement (hardware refresh) or Alternative: Proposal presents a well defined approach to the replacement of aging equipment during Option Period 1. Pros and cons along with associated risk are clearly addressed as they apply to equipment replacement through purchase, lease or other alternative approach (negating the need for a hardware refresh) such as the use of Cloud computing or other innovative solutions to hosting MSIX. The offeror presents a clear case for the method of choice identifying technical benefit, cost implications and risk. Sub-Factor 5 - Sample Task: The response to the sample task will be evaluated to determine the extent of the offeror's understanding of the Government's requirements and ability to perform the task. The clarity and completeness of responses in addressing the special issues and problems associated with the performance of the sample tasks will be evaluated. Sample Task:
PAGE 42 OF 45 ED-ESE-11-R-0035

The replacement of proprietary matching software (e-scholar) by a COTS product should address functionality as compared to current software and identify technical enhancements, drawbacks or cost savings. The proposal should clearly identify the potential risk and mitigation associated with moving to a COTS solution. Factor 2: Management Approach: The evaluation of the Management Approach factor will assess the extent to which an offeror's proposal demonstrates sound business, project management, and contract processes and procedures. Key personnel should be qualified according to standards specified in the PWS and effort should be adequate to successfully perform the tasks in the PWS. Factor 3: Teaming/Partnering Plan: The offeror's support of the United States policy regarding the utilization of Small and Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns will be evaluated. The Government strongly encourages the use of Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned Small Businesses, Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned or HUBZone Businesses. Each Offeror should submit as part of its proposal its written commitment to provide meaningful work to Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Businesses, Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned or HUBZone Businesses in the performance of this contract. The commitment may be in the form of a joint venture, teaming arrangement or subcontract with one or more qualifying entities. The Offeror's commitment will be evaluated against the following criteria: 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) The The The The The extent to which such firms are specifically identified in the proposal; extent of commitment to use such firms; complexity and variety of the work described in the PWS that the small firm are to perform; realism of the proposal; and extent of participation of such firms in terms of the value of the total acquisition.

Factor 4: Quality Control: The offeror's proposal demonstrates an administrative framework satisfactory for maintaining quality control over enhancements and O&M of MSIX. The proposed quality control processes and methods are logical, effective, easily monitored and ensure high quality performance. The following table summarizes the adjectival ratings and definitions: Excellent: Excellent in all respects; proposal offers one or more significant advantages not offset by disadvantages; demonstrates excellent understanding of requirements and approach that significantly exceeds performance or capability standards. Proposal has exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the ED MSIX. Good: High quality in most respects; proposal offers one or more advantages not offset by disadvantages; demonstrates good understanding of requirements and approach that exceeds performance or capability standards. Proposal has one or more strengths that will benefit ED MSIX project. Satisfactory: Adequate quality; any advantages are offset by disadvantages; demonstrates acceptable understanding of requirements and approach that meets performance or capability standards. Acceptable solution. Proposal has few strengths. Marginal: Overall quality cannot be determined because of errors, omissions or deficiencies which are capable of being corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal; demonstrates shallow understanding of requirements and approach that only marginally meets performance or capability standards necessary for minimal but acceptable contract performance. Unsatisfactory: Proposal contains major errors, omissions or deficiencies that cannot be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal; fails to meet performance or capability standards. Factor 5: Past Performance/Experience: Past performance experience is a measure of the degree to which an offeror, as an organization, has satisfied its customers and complied with federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The Past Performance will be evaluated to assess the offerors' past performance on contracts of similar size, scope, and complexity to assess performance risk for this RFP. The Government may call or visit the offeror's references reported hereunder to examine their assessment of the offeror's performance. The Past Performance Experience evaluation factor has the following five sub-factors, which are of equal importance: Sub-Factor 1: Technical Quality:

Evaluation will be based on the extent, depth and quality of recent corporate experience in performing the same or similar work.
PAGE 43 OF 45 ED-ESE-11-R-0035

Sub-Factor 2:

Timely Delivery of Services:

The offeror will be evaluated on meeting milestones, reliability, responsiveness to technical direction, deliverables completed on-time, and adherence to contract schedules including contract administration. Sub-Factor 3: Reasonableness of its Business Behavior: A willingness to cooperate and helpfulness in solving problems is demonstrated. Sub-Factor 4: Concern for the Customer's Interests:

The offeror will be evaluated on cooperative and proactive behavior with the technical representative(s) and Contracting Officer, flexibility, responsiveness to inquiries, problem resolution and overall customer satisfaction. The following summarizes the adjectival ratings and definitions that will be used in the Past Performance evaluation: Exceptional/High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, essentially no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort Very Good/Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Satisfactory/Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, some Doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Neutral/Unknown Confidence: No performance record identifiable (see FAR 15.305(a) (2) (iii) and (v).

Marginal/Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Changes to the offeror's existing processes may be necessary in order to achieve contract requirements. Unsatisfactory/No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Factor 6: Price: The offeror's proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness. The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of the proposed price by assessing the compatibility of proposed price with proposal scope and effort and if performed with reasonable economy and efficiency. The evaluation will be performed on the total proposed price (including fees), to include phase-in, basic performance period, and option years. Evaluation of option periods will not obligate the Government to exercise such options. Business/Price proposals shall be evaluated for completeness by assessing the responsiveness of the proposed price by assessing the level of detail the offeror provided for all requirements in the PWS.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price proposals shall be evaluated for completeness by assessing the responsiveness of the proposed price by assessing the level of detail the offeror provided for all requirements in the PWS.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are greater than price but as the technical factors become more equal, the price shall become a more significant factor. (b) "Options." The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer''s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
