Product Manufacturing Information and Composite Information Validation and Conformance Testing

Statement of Work Product Manufacturing Information and Composite Information Validation and Conformance Testing A. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Model Based Engineering Digital 3D models are replacing traditional paper drawings and blueprints because the digital models contain more information and can be reused by multiple applications. Digital information technology enables engineers and technicians in remote locations to access computer-aided design (CAD) models, diagrams, and engineering data critical for maintenance and repair of complex systems. The same digital models can be used directly to manufacture replacement parts faster and with fewer errors than with drawings. The use of CAD and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) models instead of drawings can increase quality and substantially reduce the lead time for spare parts because suppliers do not have to manually re-enter product data into their manufacturing software applications, a time consuming and error prone process. The product data model is a collection of 3D objects, documents, and configuration information that forms a complete, integrated representation of the product. The central concept embodied in model based definition is that the 3D product model is the most appropriate vehicle for delivery of all the detailed product information necessary for all aspects of the product delivery cycle. Any number of 3D views of the model can be composed, detailed, and annotated for specific downstream operations, such as manufacturing planning, production simulation, materials procurement, etc. Additional views of the model can be selectively annotated for other target operations, such as quality assurance. A model with a sequence of prepared 3D views containing key dimensions, tolerances, annotations, and notes provides a supplier a more complete communication of what must be produced. To the supplier, a 3D model is much preferred because it is possible to make additional (and completely accurate) measurements of the product that would have been impossible if only 2D drawings of the product were delivered. Product Manufacturing Information Product Manufacturing Information (PMI) conveys non-geometric attributes in 3D computer-aided design and Collaborative Product Development systems necessary for manufacturing product components or subsystems. PMI may include geometric dimensions and tolerances, 3D annotation, finish, and material specifications. Standards for defining PMI include ASME Y14.41 ­ 2003 (Digital Product Data Definition Practices), ASME Y14.5 ­ 2009 (Dimensioning and Tolerancing), and ISO 1101:2004 (Geometrical Product Specifications). ISO 10303-203:2011 (Configuration controlled 3D design of mechanical parts and assemblies, also known as STEP AP203 edition 2) is a standard for the representation and exchange of digital product data and is able to digitally

Product Manufacturing Information and Composite Information Validation and Conformance Testing

represent both graphical and precise PMI in a manner suitable for exchange between software applications. PMI annotation is usually created on the CAD model. This information can then be used by a number of down-stream processes. Some 3D modeling processes enable computer-aided manufacturing software to access PMI directly for computer numerical controlled (CNC) programming. The PMI also may be used by tolerance analysis and coordinate-measuring machine (CMM) software applications. Composite and Additive Manufacturing Information Current approaches for representing and exchanging composite and additive process information digitally are inadequate for realizing the full benefits of these emerging technologies. Additive manufacturing and composites pose unique and complex data modeling challenges. Unlike machined parts, parts manufactured additively require detailed models not only of surfaces, but also of features underneath the "skin." In subtractive processes such as machining, small data errors and internal feature data anomalies do not affect the final shape. Additive and composite process data, however, are much less fault-tolerant. These processes are extremely sensitive to even the most minute data errors and, in many cases, the resulting defects are not detectable by visual examination. ISO 10303-209:2001 (Composite and metallic structural analysis and related design, also known as STEP AP209) is a standard with limited ability to represent and exchange digital composites data. B. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT The objectives of this effort are to (1) develop software applications sufficient to measure conformance of Computer Aided Design (CAD) systems to ISO and ASME standards for Product Manufacturing Information ­ specifically geometric and dimensional tolerance (GD&T) information, and (2) determine the requirements and challenges associated with measuring the quality of composite information encoded in CAD models.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) |_| Are, |_| are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) |_| Have, |_| have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) |_| Are, |_| are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and Country of Origin _________________ _________________ _________________

(4) |_| Have, |_| have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (1) Listed end products.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507-2(d), insert the following clause: ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:

(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. (End of clause)
