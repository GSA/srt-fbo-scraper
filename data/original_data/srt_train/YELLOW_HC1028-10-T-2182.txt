52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)



52.209-9000  ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (OCCI)  (DEC 2005)

(a)  An offeror shall identify in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, any potential or actual Organizational and Consultant
Conflicts of Interest (OCCI) as described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  This includes actual or potential conflicts of interests of proposed
subcontractors.  If an offeror identifies in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, a potential or actual conflict of interests the
offeror shall submit an Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest Plan (OCCIP) to the contracting officer.  The OCCIP shall describe
how the offeror addresses potential or actual conflicts of interest and identify how they will avoid, neutralize, or mitigate present or future
conflicts of interest.

(b)  Offerors must consider whether their involvement and participation raises any OCCI issues, especially in the following areas when:

     (2)  Preparing specifications or work statements and/or objectives.

     (3)  Providing evaluation services.

     (4)  Obtaining access to proprietary information.

(c)  If a prime contractor or subcontractor breaches any of the OCCI restrictions, or does not disclose or misrepresents any relevant facts
concerning its conflict of interest, the government may take appropriate action, including terminating the contract, in additional to any
remedies that may be otherwise permitted by the contract or operation of law.

                                                                 (End of clause)

a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

(1) Listed End Product

subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;

2.  Contract or Task Order Title.  Microsoft Services, Windows 2000 Server Custom Support

3.  Background.  As announced in 2008, support for Windows 2000 Server will end on July 13, 2010. After this product reaches its end-of-support
date Microsoft will not release new updates, including security updates.
To keep the DISA CSD enterprise safe and competitive, Microsoft recommends upgrading to Windows Server 2008 R2.   Unfortunately DISA CSD and its
customers will be unable to migrate all existing Windows 2000 Server workload to Windows 2003 Server or Windows 2008 Server prior to the
13July2010 retirement of Microsoft Extended Support.  As such the acquisition of Microsoft Custom Support for DISA CSD hosted Windows 2000
Servers is paramount for maintaining the operational sustainability of DISA CSD sites.


4.  Objectives:  To acquire interim support for Windows 2000 Server systems in DISA CSD DECC’s during a one year period while CSD completes the
migration of these systems to a currently supported version of the Windows Server Operating System. Critical security updates shall be included.

5.  Scope.  Telephone support, ability to request security update.

6.  Performance Requirements.

6.1  Task 1: Problem Resolution Support.  Provide assistance for problems with specific symptoms encountered while using the Windows 2000
Server, where there is a reasonable expectation that the problem being encountered is caused by Windows 2000 Server.

6.2  Task 2: Support Assistance.  Provide short-term advice, guidance, and knowledge transfer for issues not covered  by Problem Resolution
Support that DISA CSD may encounter while using Windows Server 2000, where the is a reasonable expectation that the issue is limited to Windows
2000 Server.

6.3  Task 3: Support Account Management.  An assigned Microsoft Resource to oversee service delivery and to intercede on DISA CSD’s behalf when
an issue needs to be escalated.

6.4 Deliverables:         Monthly Activity Report.  Report to include list of Problem Resolution Support and Support Assistance support

                                              TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

|Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer,  hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of  |
|the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).; (Only one responsible source and not other supplies or    |
|services will satisfy agency requirements )                                                                                                   |

                                                                  JUSTIFICATION

   1. Agency and Contracting Activity:


        Requesting Agency:
      DISA SSO Mechanicsburg
        5450 Carlisle Pike, P. O. Box 2045
        Building 312 South
        Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0975

        Contracting Agency:
            DITCO
            2300 East Drive
            Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406

2.  Nature/Description of Action(s):

 The contract fulfills a valid need within DISA in support of hundreds of unsupported Windows 2000 Servers hosted in CSD’s Data Centers.  Without
 the support contract, the Computer Centers will be forced to purchase individual incidents, which would be costlier and cause delays greatly
 reducing CSD’s capability to manage the systems supporting critical workload for AF, Navy, Army, DLA, DFAS, etc.


3.  Description of Supplies/Services:

 Procure Microsoft Services Windows 2000 Server Custom Support.   Enrolled Product with Version and Service Pack for July 14, 2010 to July 12,
 2011.  Estimated Lifecycle cost is $200,000.


4.  Identification of Statutory Authority:  -- Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements,
10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1).

5.  Demonstration of Contractor’s Unique Qualifications:

a. Microsoft owns proprietary rights to the Windows 2000 Server Operating System and is the only source that can support DISA CSD’s inventory of
   Windows 2000 Server installations, particularly after the product is retired from the Extended Support phase and enters the Custom Support
   phase.  During the custom support phase, DISA will receive paid-for telephone support, ability to request security updates and the ability to
   request non-security hotfixes for all currently non-supported Windows 2000 Server workloads.  Microsoft will not accept requests for warranty
   support, design changes, or new features during the custom phase.  Specifically DISA CSD will obtain:
      • Assistance for problems with specific symptoms encountered while using the Enrolled Product, where there is a reasonable expectation
        that the problem is caused by the Enrolled Product.
      • Short-term advice, guidance, and knowledge transfer for issues not covered by Problem Resolution Support that DISA may encounter while
        using the Enrolled Product, where there is reasonable expectation that the issue is limited to the Enrolled Product.
      • Support Account Management from an assigned Microsoft resource (“Services Resource”) helps to build and maintain relationships with DISA
        CSD management and service delivery staff and helps DISA CSD arrange each element of the Premier Support to meet DISA’s business
        requirements.

b.  Microsoft will discontinue Extended Support of Windows 2000 server as per the following table.

|Products Released              |General Availability Date           |Mainstream Support Retired               |Extended Support Retired             |
|Windows 2000 Server            |3/31/2000                           |6/30/2005                                |7/13/2010                            |

Unfortunately DISA CSD and its customers will be unable to migrate all existing Windows 2000 Server workload to Windows 2003 Server or Windows
2008 Server prior to the 13 July2010 retirement of Microsoft Extended Support.  As such the acquisition of Microsoft Custom Support for DISA CSD
hosted Windows 2000 Servers is paramount for maintaining the operational sustainability of DISA CSD sites.

Custom Support provides customers with the opportunity to receive support on legacy versions of some Microsoft products and service packs that
have reached the end of support.  This program will help fill the gap for DISA CSD and its customers who are actively migrating, but will not be
able to finish prior to the end of support deadline.

c.  The consequence of taking no action is that Microsoft will no longer provide DISA CSD with assisted support through Microsoft Customer
Service and Support for Windows 2000 Server. Also, after 13 July2010, Microsoft will not release new updates, including security updates.

d.  Customers who remain on Windows 2000 Server will be running their organizations on servers no longer supported by Microsoft (including the
release of new security updates).  This could create a difficult situation if new vulnerabilities are discovered after 13 July2010, which in
some cases could create liability, non-conformity to regulatory compliance, and less reliability for mission-critical IT resources.


   6. FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources:

This will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) as a sole source procurement.


7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost:

This requirement will be posted to Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) as a sole source procurement.  Cost discounts will be requested and
comparisons with historical prices and quote information will be made prior to placing the order.  The Contracting Officer will make a
determination and finding that prices are fair and reasonable.  Based on this approach, it is anticipated that a fair and reasonable price will
be obtained.


8.  Description of Market Research:

DISA CSD performed research via Internet Searches and direct contact with Microsoft and determined that Microsoft was the only firm that could
provide the technical capabilities to support DISA CSD’s technical requirements.  Furthermore, through additional research it was determined
that these services could not be purchased through one of Microsoft’s partners, but only through Microsoft.  The product/service is not offered
via GSA, ESI BPA or SEWP IV Contract.  Microsoft owns the proprietary rights to the Windows 2000 Server Operating System.  This is a sole source
procurement.


9.  Any Other Supporting Facts:

DISA CSD is in the process of migrating its systems from Microsoft Windows 2000 Server to a supported Operating System, but in the mean time
will require this support contract to receive necessary support and to mitigate the risks involved in using unsupported software.


10.  Listing of Interested Sources:  None.


11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition:

Microsoft owns the proprietary rights to the Windows Operating System used in DISA CSD’s Computing Centers and is currently the only source for
the level of technical support required by DISA CSD.  DISA CSD will annually survey the commercial market place to identify any Microsoft
Partners that may be offer a contractual vehicle that could provide competitive alternative.
