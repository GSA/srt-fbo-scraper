CD2 manages the customer relationship from inception to end of project.  Key activities are customer management, implementation, program and
project management support for multiple DOD/OSD/Services/Agencies and their information systems.  Most of these information system projects have
significant senior management visibility and comparatively urgent timelines for implementation.  Additional CD2 support requirements are a
result of DOD policy for Global Information Grid (GIG) compliance.   Many currently operating and new information systems are being migrated to
DISA managed facilities to ensure policy compliance.  In addition to specific customer support, CD2 may also be tasked to develop a program
management office to manage implementation projects which ensure Global Information Grid (GIG) compliance.  This requires assessment to ensure
DECC Equivalence, sustainment, and service management.  Support may also include liaison with, and policy input to, OSD NII A&I and the OSD GIG
Waiver Panel, among others.

In accordance with current DISA transformation objectives that support DoD’s net-centric vision for the GIG, DISA CSD is integrating and
upgrading its service offerings to provide additional situational awareness and net-centric capabilities for complex DoD systems. A variety of
new value-added services being rolled out by DISA CSD represent the building blocks of integrated solutions to meet the unique needs of each
customer.

It is the role of the CME organization to establish close relationships with DISA CSD customers at both a business and technical level. The
customer relationships maintained by the CME teams enable DISA CSD to provide additional value by proactively crafting innovative IT solutions
that offer the potential to improve mission capability at a reduced cost. CME business, technical and project management representatives
leverage their understanding of DISAC SD standard service components, customer mission objectives and existing technical or operational
constraints to craft these solutions.

Integrated solutions crafted by CME teams are presented to customers for review and acceptance. Upon acceptance, the CME organization is
responsible for implementation of the proposed solution, transfer of service capability from an existing provider (if necessary) and the handoff
to DISA CSD Operations. Throughout this process CME representatives coordinate service delivery with the Infrastructure organization and
appropriate DISA CSD Cost Containers groups depending on the specifics of the solution.

12.3 Investigation Requirements.  There are two levels of personnel security investigation requirements under this contract:

12.3.1 Personnel requiring a Top Secret clearance and IT-I eligibility under this contract must undergo a favorably adjudicated Single Scope
Background Investigation (SSBI) as a minimum investigation.  The SSBI will be maintained current within 5-years and requests for Special
Background Periodic Review (SBPR) will be initiated 6-months prior to the 5-year anniversary date of the previous SSBI or SBPR.

12.3.2 Personnel requiring Secret and IT-II eligibility under this contract must undergo a favorably adjudicated National Agency Check, Local

12.4 Adjudication for IT access.  Adjudication of investigations for granting of interim or final IT-I or IT-II access will be accomplished
through DISA Security.  An exception to this is that individual contractor employees with an SSBI or SBPR (within a 5-year scope) that is
favorably adjudicated for a Top Secret security clearance by any of the Department of Defense adjudication facilities (DISCO, DIA, ACCF, AFCAF,
NAVCAF, WHSCAF) will be automatically accepted for final IT-I access.  Individual contractor employees with a NACLC or SPR (within a 10-year
scope) that is favorably adjudicated for a Secret security clearance by any of the other Department of Defense adjudication facilities will be
automatically accepted for final IT-II access.

12.5 Interim IT access.  Pending completion of a SSBI (for IT-I) or NACLC (for IT-II) and final adjudication for security clearance, contractor
employees may be granted interim authorization to perform duties designated as IT-I or IT-II. The interim authority for IT sensitive positions
is the DISA Personnel Security Office.

12.5.1 Following are the requirements, which must be met prior to granting of interim IT-I authorization:

12.5.1.1 The request for SSBI (E-QIP or Word Fillable SF 86 and fingerprint cards) must be submitted by the contractor Facility Security Officer
(FSO) through the Defense Security Service (DSS) to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Department of Defense (DoD) Personnel
Security Data Base (JPAS) must reflect that the investigation is open.  A copy of the E-QIP or SF 86 forms must be submitted to the DISA Field
Security Office, Security Manager (SM).  The SM will forward the forms along with a written request for interim IT-I authorization to DISA
Personnel Security for approval.

12.5.1.2 The National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the SSBI (Advance NAC Results should be requested by the company) or a previous valid
NCLC/DNACI/NAC or ENTNAC must be completed and favorably adjudicated before interim IT-I access will be granted. An interim security clearance
(either Top Secret or Secret, as appropriate for the position) should be requested by the company FSO for those contractor employees without a
previous investigation.

12.5.2 Following are the requirements, which must be met prior to granting of interim IT-II authorization:

The request for NACLC (E-QIP and fingerprint cards) must be submitted by the contractor Facility Security Officer (FSO) through DSS to OPM.  A
copy of the E-QIP forms must be submitted to the DISA Field Security Office, Security Manager (SM).  The SM will forward the forms along with a

Adjudication System (JPAS) to the VAR Center using the following SMO Code:  DKABAA10.

For those companies submitting the VALs via JPAS, they will also provide a copy of the VALs to the task monitors of the contract for creation of
records in the Contractor Verification System (CVS) so that Common Access Cards can be obtained for the contractors that require them.

12.6.2 For those companies that do not have the capability to send VALs via JPAS, they can send the VALs via e-mail to the task monitors.  Due
to Privacy Act concerns, the VALs will be e-mailed as a password protected “WinZip” attachment, followed up by a second e-mail containing the
password for the first e-mail.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

52.219-28    POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (APR 2009)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that
exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the
clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of
operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size
standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling

adjustment under paragraph (i) of this clause may properly include restoration or rehabilitation costs.

(l) Communication. All communications under this clause shall be in writing.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (DEC 2008)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business
segment; and similar positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA,
the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.

solicitation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
-

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

Factor 1 - Past Performance
Factor 2 – Technical/Management Approach

in the format indicated in Sections B and L of the  solicitation.  Offerors are required to submit their proposed costs for the entire 60 month
period.  The evaluation period commences with the date of contract award and ends 60 months later.  Contract months and evaluation months are
assumed to be the same.

The total proposed price for each offeror will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness.  Cost/Price will not be rated with a color.

    • Completeness: The Government will verify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs
      are presented in a clear and useful format.


    • Reasonableness:  The Government will determine the reasonableness of the overall price based on adequate price competition and by
      comparison with the Government's Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).


Option Years:  In order to be considered for award, the offeror must submit pricing for the base period and the four one-year option periods.
The option periods will be evaluated before award.  However, award of the option periods will be contingent upon:
   (1) a satisfactory or better review of the contractor's performance during the base period;
   (2) market research to establish the pricing as fair and reasonable at time of the award of the option;
   (3) and the Government’s determination of a continuing need for the requirement.


   Note: At the time of award, funds will only be obligated for the base period.


Evaluation of Proposals:


   Color Ratings.  A color rating depicts how well the offeror’s proposal meets the evaluation standards and RFP requirements.  The non-cost
   factors will receive color ratings, Cost/Price will not.  Proposals will be rated on the basis of the following color code and risk system:
