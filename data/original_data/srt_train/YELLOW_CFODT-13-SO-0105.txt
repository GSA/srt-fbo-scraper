PART I - REQUIREMENTS
1. Background Congress created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 1974 as an independent agency with the mandate to regulate commodity futures and option markets in the United States. The agency's mandate has been renewed and expanded several times since then, most recently by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In 1974 the majority of futures trading took place in the agricultural sector. The CFTC's history demonstrates, among other things, how the futures industry has become increasingly varied over time and today encompasses a vast array of highly complex financial futures contracts. Today, the CFTC assures the economic utility of the futures markets by encouraging their competitiveness and efficiency, protecting market participants against fraud, manipulation, and abusive trading practices, and by ensuring the financial integrity of the clearing process. Through effective oversight, the CFTC enables the futures markets to serve the important function of providing a means for price discovery and offsetting price risk. The CFTC's mission is to protect market users and the public from fraud, manipulation, abusive practices and systemic risk related to derivatives that are subject to the Commodity Exchange Act, and to foster open, competitive, and financially sound markets. The CFTC's Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR) oversees derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs) and other market participants in the clearing process, including futures commission merchants, swap dealers, major swap participants and large traders. It monitors the clearing of futures, options on futures, and swaps by DCOs, assesses DCO compliance with Commission regulations, and conducts risk assessment and financial surveillance. DCR also makes recommendations on DCO applications and eligibility, rule submissions, and which types of swaps should be cleared. 2. Objectives The Commission requires a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) analytic tool to identify and manage the financial risk of accounts in all commodity futures, swaps, and options cleared by all registered DCOs for use by its risk analysts in DCR. 3. General Scope The contractor shall provide all facilities, supervision, personnel, equipment, materials and supplies (except as explicitly set forth under the clause entitled "Government Furnished Property") necessary to perform the work set forth in this contract. The contractor shall provide software, software implementation, training, and software maintenance and technical support. 4

CFODT-13-SO-0105

4. Software Requirements The contractor shall provide a software-only based analytic tool that can be used to identify and manage the financial risk on DCO-held accounts with assets in commodity futures, swaps, and options. CFTC requires a license that will support up to 10 concurrent users. CFTC understands that licenses are not necessarily sold based on the number of concurrent users. Regardless of how the license is sold, the software license must allow 10 concurrent users to access the software. The COTS software must be installed and data located within the CFTC network. CFTC will not consider any proposed solutions that put forward Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. Additionally, the software must satisfy the following requirements: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Market risk management system capable of real-time market monitoring and end of day position monitoring of exchange-listed futures, options, and OTC swaps (commodities only). Capability to display aggregate firm, individual or customer account and user-level account position and monitor risk (i.e. liquidity, capital, account position). Ability to scale quickly to support new instruments and data formats and ensure quality of the incoming data. Capability to calculate and display risk sensitivities, risk measures, or hedge parameters by account. Capability to calculate and display daily position and daily Profit & Loss (P&L) by account. Capability to calculate and display shock analyses or other scenario modeling, including effect of integration of option trees by account. Capability to generate risk alerts based on pre-set triggers such as Value at Risk (VaR) and P&L change thresholds. Capability to generate and distribute automated periodic reporting. Capability to integrate with transaction and real-time pricing data. The contractor's solution must have a mechanism in place to handle proprietary data: o Capability to easily import position and open interest data from CFTC internal sources (e.g. Microsoft SQL Server and XML or CSV files). o Capability to pull in live prices (e.g. Future Source, Bloomberg) and display P&L from previous closing prices. The CFTC has data licenses for both Future Source and Bloomberg. o Capability to easily integrate live prices with large trader end-of-day positions, market data, order data, and other trade data provided by the CFTC or directly from other sources (both commercial and non-commercial). o Must handle data securely as the CFTC data is considered highly sensitive--the contractor shall be required to follow strict security guidelines when handling such data. Capability to provide risk exposure data and preset risk limit alerts to Risk Analysts for real-time analysis (not batch).

ˇ

5

CFODT-13-SO-0105

ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ 5.

Capability to calculate portfolio P&L based on user-defined market simulations, perform net positional stress tests on user-defined and saved conditional parameters, and perform what-if analysis. Capability for the user to define automated email alerts based on portfolio risk, stress test losses, and real time P&L. Capability to provide software customization and modification if any functional gaps are identified. Must use state of the art 64-bit multi-processor Windows technology/platform. Must support unlimited application programming interface (API) access to the software functions and data generated from it. Software Implementation

The software shall be installed at CFTC's Headquarters building, located at 1155 21st Street, NW, in Washington, DC. The system shall support CFTC's Washington DC Headquarters, as well as the CFTC Regional offices in Chicago, IL; New York, NY; and Kansas City, MO. The Contractor shall install and configure the risk management software platform in test and production environments. The CFTC will provide an IT Specialist for the purpose of acting as a technical expert regarding CFTC's systems during installation of the risk management system. The CFTC will provide business process experts to work with the contractor during the implementation phase. The testing performed by the contractor shall include all pre/post-testing of the system, which shall include maintaining quality control, as well as performing user acceptance testing. The CFTC intends to use the user acceptance testing as part of its acceptance process. During implementation, and at the discretion of the COR, the Contractor's Project Manager shall participate in project progress meetings with the COR. The frequency of the meetings will vary, and may be daily at times. The purpose of the meetings will be to discuss the project status, as well as to identify and discuss configuration/integration issues, and to coordinate schedules. Acceptance of implementation will be made upon installation of the software at CFTC and successful completion of a fourteen (14) calendar day acceptance test period. Successful completion means that the software operates in the CFTC production environment with access by 10 concurrent users for 14 consecutive days, and otherwise performs in accordance with all contract requirements and as described in the Contractor's proposal. In the event the software does not successfully complete the first acceptance test, the Contractor shall have up to 14 days to make appropriate corrections and commence a second 14-calendar day acceptance test. In the event the second acceptance test is not successfully completed, or any subsequent test agreed to by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to issue a final rejection of the software and terminate the contract without any financial obligation to the contractor. Any work performed by the Contractor prior to acceptance, including work performed as a result of failure to successfully complete a test, shall be at no cost to CFTC

CFODT-13-SO-0105

The effective date of the software licenses shall be the date the system is accepted by CFTC. This will also be the date of commencement for the initial 12 month of software maintenance and technical support (see Part I, Section 8). 6. Documentation The contractor shall deliver a systems administration guide and all production documentation within one (1) week after receiving formal notification that the implemented system is accepted. The systems administration guide and production documentation shall be provided in a searchable electronic format agreeable to the Contracting Officer or the COR. 7. Training The Contractor shall provide user training for 10 users. Training shall be provided in Chicago Il, either at the CFTC Central Regional Office located at 525 West Monroe Street, Chicago, Il, or at another facility in Chicago provided by the Contractor. Scheduling of the training shall be done through the COR but shall in any case be provided no later than 30 days after CFTC acceptance of the software. The contractor shall furnish each CFTC trainee with a training guide, which shall be a suitable reference for using and troubleshooting the system. 8. Software Maintenance and Technical Support The contractor shall provide Help Desk/Technical Support during and after implementation of the software system. The support shall be available either on-site or via phone. During the base period of the contract, software maintenance and technical support, including patches, fixes, new software versions, version updates, instrument database updates, data format and technical support (either on-site or via phone or email) shall be provided for 12 months from the date the system is accepted by CFTC. CFTC shall also have the option(s) to continue software maintenance and technical support for up to four additional years (see Part II, Clause entitled "Term of Contract ­ Options"). 9. Additional Concurrent Users CFTC may require additional concurrent users of the software. The contractor shall provide rights to and enable additional users, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract, if and when ordered in writing by the Contracting Officer.

Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information (a) As used in this clause, "confidential information" means information obtained during performance of the contract that is private or confidential in nature, and which is not meant for public disclosure. Examples of "confidential information" include, but are not limited to, investigatory materials, sensitive or proprietary business, technical, financial or personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to the Government, other companies or individuals in paper or electronic form, including but not limited to home addresses or personal contact information, full or partial social security numbers, credit card numbers, date of birth, passport numbers, employee performance or evaluation information, or any information related to a security adjudication of any CFTC employee or contractor. (b) Pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. § 1, et. seq.), other laws and the terms and conditions of this contract, the Contractor agrees to use confidential information only for the purposes of performing work under this contract, and to otherwise hold such information confidential. The Contractor shall not directly or indirectly use or allow the use of or access to confidential information for any purpose other than that directly associated with officially assigned duties, and shall not, either by direct action or by counsel, discussion, recommendation, or suggestion to any third party, reveal the nature or content of any confidential information. The Contractor shall take appropriate steps to secure both paper and computer files and access to same to protect confidential information, shall lock paper records in cabinets or offices when not in use, shall only electronically transmit confidential information in encrypted form, and shall dispose of paper records by shredding or similar means of secure destruction. (c) The Contractor shall obtain from each employee permitted access a written agreement, in a form satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, that he/she will not disclose any such confidential information to any third party except those persons within the Contractor's organization or the Government directly concerned with the performance of the contract and who have a legitimate need to know such information to perform their assigned duties. The completed form shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer prior to each employee beginning work under this contract. (d) If disclosure of confidential information to a third party is determined to be necessary by the Commission, the Contractor shall first obtain written authorization from the Contracting Officer prior to disclosing the confidential information. The Contractor shall continue to comply with this clause after expiration of this contract. (e) The Contractor shall comply with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. § 3541 et seq., and related 13

CFODT-13-SO-0105

regulations, shall use administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect CFTC confidential information from unauthorized access, disclosure and misuse. The Contractor's staff with access to confidential information shall comply with CFTC policies, procedures and guidelines related to information security and privacy, including but not limited to Safeguarding Personally Identifiable Information and the IT Rules of Behavior. The Contractor staff with access to PII shall annually attend the Commission's mandatory privacy and security training program and participate in other CFTC training programs as requested. (f) In the event of an incident involving the loss, compromise or unauthorized disclosure, real or potential, of PII, the Contractor shall report the incident to the COR immediately and no later than one (1) hour upon discovery of the incident, and if the COR cannot be immediately reached, to the CFTC Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Privacy Officer. The Contractor shall cooperate with CFTC personnel in handling any investigation of the incident and mitigating risks of similar future incidents. 13. Computer Security The Contractor shall obtain, read, understand, and comply with the policy and procedures of the Commission's computer security program and limited personal use policy prior to being granted access to the internal network. Access to CFTC computer systems is requested and granted only on an as-needed basis to perform official CFTC business. Computer systems and hardware may not be modified by the Contractor without express written consent from the COR. The downloading of computer games and/or their operation is prohibited. 14. Personnel Security A. Personnel suitability/security checks are required only for Contractor staff who will need access to CFTC-controlled information systems, or will need access to CFTC premises and will be unescorted while on CFTC's premises. B. Contractor staff who are expected to be employed on this BPA for six months or less and who will require access to CFTC-controlled information systems and/or unescorted access to CFTC facilities shall be subject to a Special Agreement Check (hereinafter referred to as a "SAC" or "Check"). To initiate this Check, the Contractor shall ensure that such staff complete an OFI Form 86C (Special Agreement Check), an Authorization for Release of Information, and a release authorizing CFTC to obtain a credit report. This Check must be favorably adjudicated for the staff to obtain employment in this capacity. C. Contractor staff who are expected to be employed on this BPA for greater than six months and who will require access to CFTC-controlled information systems and/or unescorted access to CFTC facilities will be required, at a minimum, to undergo a SAC and a National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI). The SAC must be favorably adjudicated for the staff to obtain employment in this capacity. The NACI must be favorably adjudicated post-employment for the staff to continue employment in this capacity. Depending upon the duties assigned, CFTC may require a higher level investigation, such as a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI), a Limited Background Investigation (LBI), a Background Investigation (BI), or a Single Scope 14

CFODT-13-SO-0105

Background Investigation (SSBI). (NACI and higher level investigations are hereinafter referred to as "Investigations.") Any higher level Investigations must be favorably adjudicated for the staff to continue employment in this capacity. D. The Check and Investigations cited in paragraphs B and C above will not be required if: (1) Contractor staff possess a valid current Federal identity credential that is verified by the individual's former department or agency to the satisfaction of the CFTC; and (2) the individual has undergone the required Check and/or Investigations at another agency and has been favorably adjudicated. If the completed NACI occurred 15 or more years ago, the CFTC has the discretion to determine whether a new Investigation is needed and whether a higher level investigation is warranted. The Contractor shall comply with this determination and shall ensure that contractor staff complete and submit the necessary documents within the time frame established by the CFTC or risk its staff being rendered ineligible to perform under the BPA with the CFTC. E.1. In the event Contractor staff referred to in paragraph D above meet the requirements of that paragraph, Contractor shall provide to the COR the candidates' name, social security number, date of birth, and city and state of birth for verification purposes. E.2. If Contractor staff do not have current clearances or a favorably-adjudicated Check and Investigation prior to working at CFTC or gaining access to federally-controlled information systems, Contractor shall ensure that the required background investigation forms, as defined by a CFTC Personnel Security Representative, are submitted to the CFTC Personnel Security Representative as follows. Forms required under paragraph B above shall be submitted to the CFTC Personnel Security Representative not later than five days after the effective date of this BPA. Forms required under paragraph C and D above shall be submitted not later than five days after they are identified by CFTC. F. Contractor staff described in paragraph B above who remain on site at CFTC for greater than six months shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph C above. G. All investigation forms are available on the Internet at http://www.opm.gov/Forms/html/sf.asp or from the CFTC Personnel Security Representative at the following address: CFTC Personnel Security Representative Logistics and Operations, Room 1006 Commodity Futures Trading Commission 1155 21st Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20581 H. Completed investigation forms shall be submitted to the CFTC Personnel Security Representative at the address cited above. The Personnel Security Representative will arrange for fingerprinting of candidates and submit completed applications and fingerprints to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for investigation.

15

CFODT-13-SO-0105

I. For Contractor staff as described in paragraph C above, the SAC will serve as a pre-screening measure and will meet interim clearance needs. The subject Contractor staff may be allowed to commence work with a favorable finding on the SAC. Continuation of work for CFTC depends upon favorable adjudication by the CFTC Personnel Security Director of the NACI. If required by the contractor staff's work, the agency may require an investigation higher than a NACI after the contractor staff is on board. Any subsequent Investigation must be favorably adjudicated by the CFTC Personnel Security Director in order for the contractor staff to continue to work at CFTC. J. The Contractor shall ensure that its staff maintains valid clearances as necessary while performing work for CFTC under this BPA. However, should clearances from another agency expire during the period of performance under the BPA, the Contractor shall immediately notify the COR. The Personnel Security Representative will determine if the Contractor needs to renew its staff's clearance. If so, CFTC may initiate the necessary Checks and Investigations. K. In addition to the security requirements cited above, prior to fingerprinting and upon commencement of work at the Commission, all staff described in paragraphs B and C above must show the Personal Security Representative two forms of original identification. One such identification must be a valid state or federal government issued picture identification; the second must be from the list of acceptable documentation contained in Form I-9 (Revision 05/31/05). Identification verification is required before CFTC will issue a personal identification verification card to the Contractor staff. 15. Liability This clause addresses liability arising beyond that which is specific to Government property. Liability for shortages, loss, damages or destruction of Government property is addressed in the "Use of Government Property" clause of this BPA. The Contractor shall be responsible for all liabilities which result from willful misconduct, gross negligence, or lack of good faith on the part of any of its officers and employees. Such liability is not restricted by any dollar limitations. 16. Compliance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 All electronic and information technology ("EIT") (i.e., services) procured through this contract must meet the applicable accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194, unless an agency exception to this requirement exists. 36 CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). In the event that the contractor's work does not meet such standards, and the defect is brought to the contractor's attention no later than one year after the date of final payment under this task order, the contractor will be responsible for correcting the work at no cost to the Government.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

29

CFODT-13-SO-0105

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

For price evaluation purposes only, provide pricing for the following schedule which assumes that CFTC purchases licenses for 10 additional users each year. This represents CFTC's estimate of likely purchases during the life of the contract. Assume that additional licenses are purchased on the first day of each contract period so that pricing reflects a full year of maintenance and technical support for the new licenses during the year of purchase. The price of maintenance and technical support shall reflect support for all licenses owned and purchased during each contract period. (Note that actual purchases during the contract period may be more or less than these amounts):

Line Item 10: Optional Enterprise License. While not required, Offerors are invited to propose an enterprise license as an option to CFTC. The price of the optional enterprise license shall be quoted in this volume for the base year and each option year. Note: Notwithstanding the estimated quantities of additional users provided in this RFP, CFTC requires that the price for a 10 concurrent user license, including implementation, documentation, training and 12 months of maintenance and technical support, not exceed $100,000 for the base year and not exceed $100,000 for maintenance and technical support for each option year. CFTC will not consider any proposed solution that exceeds this limitation. This limitation is for budgetary purposes only and shall not preclude CFTC from placing orders for additional users that exceed these dollar limitations if there is a need and funding is available. D. System Demonstration At the sole discretion of CFTC, Offerors may be invited to provide the Commission with a demonstration of their proposed software. If demonstrations are held, they will be requested of all Offerors found, on the basis of written proposals, to have a reasonable likelihood of receiving an award pursuant to this RFP. The purpose of the demonstration would be to assist the Commission in assessing the extent to which the proposed technical solution would meet the functionality described in RFP Part I, Section 4, as well as other qualitative 38

CFODT-13-SO-0105

considerations. Demonstrations, if held, will be at CFTC Central Regional Office located at 525 West Monroe Street, Chicago, Il. Offerors will be given a total of sixty (60) minutes to demonstrate their proposed software. Offerors shall supply their own presentation equipment. A screen will be provided by CFTC. Offerors will not be given access to CFTC's computer network. After the demonstration, CFTC will conduct an untimed open question session. In the event system demonstrations are held, CFTC will attempt to arrange a specific time and date that is most convenient to all attendees. E. Evaluation Criteria (1) The Government intends to award a single contract to the Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, represents the best value to the Government. In considering which Offeror represents the best value, CFTC will consider the following technical criteria, which are listed in declining order of importance: a. Proposed Solution b. Corporate Experience and Past Performance (2) From the standpoint of the relative importance of price to the technical criteria, the technical criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, as the merit of technical factors in competing proposals approaches equality, price will become increasingly more significant as an evaluation factor. (3) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, proposals should contain the best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be desirable. Note: The Government reserves the right to remove any firm from further consideration, at any point in the evaluation process, if the Contracting Officer determines that they do not stand a reasonable likelihood for award. (4) The Government will evaluate each technical criterion as follows: a. Proposed Solution - The Offeror's technical solution will be evaluated on the extent to which it meets and exceeds CFTC's requirements set forth in the solicitation. In particular, CFTC will evaluate the Offeror's response to RFP Part III, Section 2 (C)(3)(a), Subsections (i) through (viii) entitled Completed Functionality Matrix, Proposed Software Solution, Section 508 Compliance, Description of Software Licenses, Description of Maintenance and Technical Support, Implementation Plan, Training, and if the Offeror is a reseller, Third Party Agreement. The Commission will evaluate information provided in the written proposal, as well as information obtained during the system demonstration (if held), responses to clarification questions and information provided by discussions and/or proposal revisions, if any. 39

CFODT-13-SO-0105

b. Corporate Experience and Past Performance - The Offeror's history of successfully performing projects similar in scope, magnitude and complexity to this project will be evaluated on the extent to which it demonstrates a likelihood of successful performance under the contract. An important factor indicating similarity to this project will be the extent to which the cited projects involved implementing the proposed risk management software. The evaluation will be based on information provided in the written proposal, references if contacted, information provided in response to any clarification questions, information provided by discussions and/or proposal revisions, if any, and any other information available to the Government. As part of this evaluation, the Commission will also consider comments from past performance references (if contacted) on their experiences with the contractor and using the proposed software. c. Price ­ The evaluated price will be the sum of the firm fixed prices for Line Items 1(b) through 1(d), and the total of prices quoted in the "Table of Estimated Costs". The price of the enterprise license, if offered, will not be included in the price evaluation, but if advantageous to the Government, the price will be considered as a factor in selection for award.
