this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum,

and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and

(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and
provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions
of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.

(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for
receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.

(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of
offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the
sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.

(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for
satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.

(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:

(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office
designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is
4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.

(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the
exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting
Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--

(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to
the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under
the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.

(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at
any time it is received and may be accepted.

(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the
offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.

(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office
designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the
same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to
oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at
any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.
An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the
identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions
with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However,
the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may
reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.

(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government
reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror
specifies otherwise in the offer.

declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) ( ___   ) Have, ( ___   ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state
or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or

amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

_____________________________________________________________________________

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: (Hawaii):  $1.66 per hour, or $66.40 per week, or $297.73 per month hour for all employees on whose behalf the contractor
provides health care benefits pursuant to the Hawaii prepaid Health Care Act.  For those employees who are not receiving health care benefits
mandated by the Hawaii prepaid Health Care Act, the new health and welfare benefit rate will be $4.02 per hour.

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 after 15 years.  Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present
contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal
facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the
named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)


THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a
bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer System Analysts and
Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an
hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all
occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within
those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances
may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within
the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA
wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance
note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of
the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and
whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or
system functional specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including
prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will
earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.  If you are a full-time employed
(40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25%
of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is
considered overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard
when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending,
dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash
powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.   Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance
operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close
proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration
of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate
or adjacent work area or equipment being used.  All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary
ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by
the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer,
by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an
expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The
Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and
maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the
absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to
the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal
garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the
cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for
uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at
http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the
contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the
contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and
the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by
such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement
date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be
prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency
(FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the
agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the
employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of
employees performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations
and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards
Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting
officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification
already listed in the wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included
in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the
wage determination.

MCB Hawaii, Building 1089/144,  Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii 96863-3002

8.0  WORK ENVIRONMENT AND PHYSICAL DEMANDS
Work is normally performed in the office setting.

9.0  SECURITY CLEARANCE CONTRACT SECURITY REQUIREMENT

Work under this task order requires Level III IT user access to the Marine Corps Enterprise Network (MCEN) - access to the MCEN requires a
Common Access Card which is obtained through MCB Hawaii’s Trusted Agent Sponsorship System (TASS) upon completion of HSPD-12 credentialing.

No Foreign National will be employed on this government contract.

Prior to the commencement of work, the employee will complete required credentialing for CAC eligibility (two options) :

      1. Option One - Interim Credentialing Standard.  To receive a CAC under this standard, the Contractor shall comply with the HSPD-12 E-
Verify Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Clause 52.222-54  Employment Eligibility Verification for their employees.  Further, the employee
must have completed an FBI Fingerprint Check that returned favorable results, and have submitted a National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI)
to the Office of Personnel Management.  This standard’s process is facilitated by:

            a.  the MCB Hawaii Command Security Manager’s Office, who will provide fingerprinting and NACI submission;

            b. the MCB Hawaii-assigned agent in the Trusted Agent Sponsorship System (TASS) who will submit the appropriate application for a
CAC in TASS;

            c.  the MCB Hawaii DEERS ID Center, who will validate the employees identity based on two identity source documents, at least one of
which is a valid Federal or State government-issued picture identification, prior to issuing the CAC.

An “UNFAVORABLE” adjudication of the contract employee’s investigation will result in immediate termination.

      2.  Option Two -  Single and Final Credentialing Standard.  To receive a CAC under this standard, the MCB Hawaii Command Security Manager
will review JPAS for appropriate, previously completed  and favorably adjudicated investigation, and continuity in federal service.  If the HSPD-
12 standards are met, a CAC will be authorized by the assigned MCB Hawaii Trusted Agent, and issued through the MCB Hawaii DEERS ID Center who ,
in turn, will validate the employees identity based on two identity source documents, at least one of which is a valid Federal or State
government-issued picture identification, prior to issuing the CAC.

In all cases, each contractor employee shall comply with the HSPD-12 E-Verify Federal Acquisition Regulations FAR Clause 52.222-54 Employment
Eligibility Verification.

In all cases, each contractor employee shall comply with all applicable DoD security regulations and procedures during the performance of this
task order. Contractor shall not disclose and shall safeguard procurement sensitive information, computer systems and data, privacy act data,
For Official Use Only (FOUO) information, classified information, and all government personnel work products that are obtained or generated in
the performance of this task order.

In all cases, each contractor employee must be entered into the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), and then owned by their contracting
company facility security officer (FSO). The MCB Hawaii Command Security Manager will then track and monitor their investigation status in JPAS.

Personnel cannot be properly processed and provided system access prior to their reporting date without sufficient prior coordination between
Contractor FSO and the COR to insure credentialing standards are achieved.

All contract personnel will in-process with the MCB Hawaii COR, Trusted Agent, and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the command and
will out-process with the Trusted Agent prior to their departure.

Please note: When processing a Questionnaire for National Security Positions, the applicants can only access the
e-QIP system if they have been instructed to do so by the MCB Hawaii Command Security Manager.   Individuals
cannot pre-apply for a security clearance, nor update their security questionnaire, unless granted access by an appropriate agency official.

The Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility will provide notification of the completed investigation to the MCB Hawaii Command
Security Manager for determination in cases where a favorable determination cannot be reached due to the discovery of potentially derogatory
information. The command will provide written notification to the contractor advising whether or not the contractor employee will be admitted to
command areas and/or be provided access to Controlled Unclassified Information.  Determinations are the sole prerogative of the MCB Hawaii
Commanding Officer. If the commanding officer determines, upon review of the investigation, that allowing a person to perform certain duties or
access to certain areas, would pose an unacceptable risk, that decision is final. No due process procedures are required.

All authorized users of the MCEN shall receive initial Information Assurance (IA) orientation as a condition of access, and thereafter must
complete annual IA Awareness refresher training to maintain an active user account.

The contractor employee shall take all lawful steps available to ensure that information provided or generated pursuant to this arrangement is
protected from further disclosure unless the agency provides written consent to such disclosure.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards
Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.

    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in
      providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also
      an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.
