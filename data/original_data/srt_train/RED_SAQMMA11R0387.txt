The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) __ Are, __ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) __Have, __ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) __ Are, __ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) __ Have, __ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has

Page 24 of 28 SAQMMA11R0387

been issued a notice under I.R.C. ? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ? 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or (2) __Outside the United States. (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] __ (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror __ does __ does not certify that-(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. __(2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (1)(3) through (1)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

III.	Contractor Evaluation Rating Guidelines

It is essential that the individual providing reference information for a contractor understand the rating scale and the criteria for assigning a particular rating to a contractor’s performance.  In general, the evaluation questions ask how well a contractor performed on an aspect of the contract.  The performance rating scale has a normal range from “Unsatisfactory” to “Exceptional.”  The ratings and general guidelines for their use are described below.

Unsatisfactory - Due to substandard performance, non-conformance to requirements, or non-responsiveness, the contractor has been unable to achieve contract requirements despite the additional use of significant customer resources.

Poor - Due to marginal performance, partial non-conformance to requirements, or occasional non-responsiveness, the contractor has required significant additional customer resources to be able to meet contract requirements.

Fair - The contractor has been able to meet contract requirements with only minor additional customer resources, performed at a generally adequate level, and has been somewhat responsive to the customer.

Good - With only minor exceptions, the contractor has generally met all contract requirements, performed up to expectations, and been responsive to the customer.

Excellent - The contractor has met all contract requirements, met all performance expectations, and has been consistently responsive to the customer.

Exceptional - The contractor has gone beyond contract requirements to add value for the customer and performed in an exemplary manner.

Section M: Evaluation Factors for Award



M.1	GENERAL

The Government intends to make a single award resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value solution after evaluation in accordance with the factors in the solicitation.  

M.2	BASIS FOR AWARD

The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the requirements of the solicitation and is evaluated as being the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, price is the most important consideration followed by past performance, technical capability, and management.  Awards will not be automatically determined by numerical calculation or relationship between the non-price factors and price.  As non-price factors, when combined, become more equal, the evaluated cost or price rises in importance and may become the determining factor.  The Contracting Officer will determine what trade-off between the non-price factors and cost or price promises the greatest value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The Government contemplates the award of a contract to the most responsive and responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  

This procurement is to be conducted in accordance with FAR 8.405-1 through FAR 8.405-3.

M.3	EVALUATION FACTORS AND METHODOLOGY

The Technical Approach and Competencies, Management Approach, Evaluation Factors will be evaluated using an adjectival (Outstanding, Acceptable, Marginal, Unacceptable) rating scheme.  An “Unacceptable” rating in any factor will result in the elimination of an Offeror’s proposal from consideration for award.  

The following evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance apply to this procurement and will be used to evaluate the offer:

Price

Past Performance

Technnical Capability 

Experience working with non-native English speakers.

Demonstrated ability to secure necessary teleconference lines in the developed and developing world.

Demonstrated capability to establish and monitor calls 24/7 365 days per year

Ability to recapture lost lines during a conference call.

Management/Business Approach 







M.4	ELIGIBILITY FOR AWARD

Proposals shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions set out in Section L.  The Government will review proposals submitted to determine conformance with the proposal preparation instructions.  If it is determined that the proposal is substantially not in conformance with the instructions in Section L, the Government may deem that proposal to be unacceptable and it will not be evaluated further.  The proposal may be removed from consideration for contract award.

To be eligible for award, offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, technical factors, and pricing information.  Failure to comply with all terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the offeror being removed from award consideration, and any omission of solicitation terms and conditions must be fully explained and justified.  As such, the Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of technical requirements, to include terms and conditions, and price, such that the proposal reflects an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the overall requirements of the solicitation.

The determination of offeror responsibility will be made by the Contracting Officer and will be assessed on a pass/fail basis.  The Government will make determinations of responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.1 (Responsible Prospective Contractors) using information provided in the Business Proposal volume and information available from other sources.  The Government also reserves the right to determine the responsibility of prospective major subcontractors.

M.5	SOURCE SELECTION PROCESS

The Government intends to make the award without discussions on the basis of initial proposals received.  However, the Government may elect to make awards with discussions if it is determined to be in the Government’s best interest.  However, offerors are cautioned to submit their pricing proposals on the most favorable basis since the Government reserves the right to make awards without discussions in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.209 (a).

If the Government elects to make awards with discussions, it reserves the right, before requesting a final proposal revision, to: 1) limit the number of offerors in the competitive range to the greatest number of proposals that will permit an adequate competition among the technically acceptable proposals; 2) make more than one competitive range determination; 3) conduct more than one round of discussions; and 4) conduct more than one round of proposal revisions.

M.6	SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS

The Government reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions of the solicitation at any time before or after receipt of proposals.  If the Government amends the solicitation, the Government will so advise all parties receiving the solicitation (if the amendment is issued before the established time and date for receipt of proposals) or all offerors that have not been eliminated from the competition (if the amendment is issued after the established time and date for receipt of proposals).

M.7	EVALUATION SUPPORT

Offerors are hereby notified that the Government may use outside contractors to assist in the evaluation of proposals.  Those contractors will have access to any and all information contained in the offeror’s proposals and will be subject to appropriate conflict of interest, standards of conduct, and confidentiality restrictions. 

M.8	NON-PRICE FACTOR RATINGS

The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated with respect to the non-price factors.

For the Technical Competencies, subjective technical rating shall be as follows:

Exceptional:	Exceeds specified performance or capability in a beneficial way, has a high probability of success

Acceptable:	Satisfies evaluation criteria; good probability of success; weaknesses can be readily corrected

Marginal:	Fails to satisfy the evaluation criteria; low probability of success; significant weaknesses, but correctable

Unacceptable:	Substantially deficient in addressing the mandatory requirements, i.e. fails to minimally satisfy the evaluation criteria




For the Past Performance Factor, the following adjectival ratings will be used.

Confidence:  	The offeror’s past performance record indicates the offeror can successfully satisfy our contract requirements.  Some Government intervention is expected to be required in obtaining the required support.

Unknown confidence: 	The offeror has no relevant performance record.  A review was unable to identify any relevant past performance information (see FAR 15.305).  This is a neutral rating.  It does not hinder nor help the offeror.

No confidence: 	The offeror’s past performance record provides extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully satisfy our contract requirements. Regardless of the degree of Government intervention, obtaining the required support is doubtful.

M.9	TECHNICAL EVALUATION

The technical evaluation of proposals will be based upon the technical evaluation criteria listed below in descending order of importance.

Price

Past Performance

Technnical Capability 

Experience working with non-native English speakers.

Demonstrated ability to secure necessary teleconference lines in the developed and developing world.

Demonstrated capability to establish and monitor calls 24/7 365 days per year

Ability to recapture lost lines during a conference call.

Management/Business Approach 



M.9.1  	PRICE  FACTOR

The principal basis for evaluating price as a factor for award under this solicitation will be an evaluation of the offerors’ respective overall proposed prices.

The Government will conduct an evaluation to determine ultimately if the overall proposed prices are fair and reasonable.  In doing so, the Government will examine the completeness, accuracy, fairness, and reasonableness of the offeror’s proposed prices.  

The Government will use one or more of the proposal analysis techniques stipulated in FAR 15.404 to conduct the price evaluation.

The Government will use the proposed prices for price evaluation purposes only (for award of the contract); it does not commit to paying these prices.  

The price evaluation will include price analyses that will measure the Government’s exposure to price risk.  

M.9.1.1	ADDITIONAL PRICE ANALYSES

To ensure fair, reasonable, balanced, and realistic prices, the Government may perform additional price and/or cost analysis in accordance with FAR Part 15.404 for the offered requirements.  Prices that are determined to be unrealistic, unbalanced, or not fair and reasonable, will not be accepted by the Government. 

The Government will also examine offers for unbalanced pricing.  The Government may reject any offer that is materially unbalanced in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g).M.9.2  	

M.9.2	Past Performance Factor

The Government will assess the offeror’s cited experiences within the past three (3) years. 

The offeror’s Past Performance evaluation will examine how the offeror’s past and present experience/performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction based on the information provided by the offeror’s references and other government sources.  

The Past Performance evaluation will examine the offeror’s Past Performance Contract Profiles and the offeror’s actual performance in work of similar size, scope, and complexity of efforts; and actual results achieved during performance. 

The Government may consider all information available on the offeror’s experience and past performance. This will include information that is in addition to that which is provided by the offeror (i.e., Past Performance Retrieval System). The Government reserves the right to interview the clients identified by the offeror and may interview other clients of whom the Government is aware. 

The Government may share a copy of the Past Performance Profile with the referenced customer to validate the offeror’s report. To facilitate the evaluation of Past Performance, the offeror shall ensure the accuracy of the information furnished on references (names, addresses, and phone numbers). Failure to provide accurate or complete reference information will have a negative impact on the evaluation of the offeror’s proposal and may render it unacceptable.

The Government will use the adjectival ratings listed above for the Past Performance factor.




Adjectival Ratings for Evaluation Factor 2






M.9.3  	Management/Business Competencies Factor

The Government will evaluate the availability of the offeror’s resources including:  staffing, corporate support, facilities and equipment.  The Government will evaluate the processes and the offeror’s ability to respond quickly and efficiently to this Contract.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed processes, including management expertise and overall effectiveness, of the offeror's proposed processes to manage these tasks. The Government will also evaluate offeror’s availability of funding and other financial resources for this effort.  

The Government will evaluate for merit the offeror's basis for subcontracting/teaming or advisory arrangements and the management procedures for monitoring and controlling those arrangements as identified in the proposed organizational chart.  The Offeror will be evaluated on the reasonableness and extent of the functional split of responsibilities between the prime and subcontractors.  The offeror will be evaluated on thoroughness and completeness of its plan for integrating the efforts of the prime Contract with any proposed subcontracts/teaming arrangements and/or advisory agreements.  The offeror will be evaluated on the effectiveness and efficiency of its plan for identifying and addressing any problems that arise as a result of the proposed organizational structure or poor and/or non-performance of subcontracted portions of the Contract.  The Government will also evaluate the benefits to the Government of these arrangements.




The Government will use the adjectival ratings in the Table BELOW TO evaluate the Management Approach Factor.
