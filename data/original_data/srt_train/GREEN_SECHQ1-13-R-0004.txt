B.3

Contract Type

This is a multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for commercial information technology modernization, development and support services, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. Orders will be issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 16.5 and the procedures set forth in this contract. Orders will be awarded on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) or Time & Materials/Labor Hour (T&M/LH) basis. B.4 Period of Performance

The term of the contract is a five-year base ordering period with one, five-year optional ordering period, for a total potential ordering period of ten years. This is not a multi-year contract as defined in FAR Part 17.1. B.5 IDIQ Minimum/Maximum

(a) The IDIQ minimum for this contract is $1,000.00 for the five-year base ordering periods. There is no additional minimum amount for the additional five-year optional ordering period. (b) The IDIQ maximum for this contract, inclusive of all orders issued in both the base and optional ordering periods is $80,000,000.00. B.6 Organizational Conflicts Of Interest (OCOI)

The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI), as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5. The Contractor further warrants that it has disclosed all information to the Contracting Officer relevant to any actual, apparent or potential OCOI.

4

DIOMDS Request For Proposal RFP No. SECHQ113R0004

The Contractor agrees that if an actual, apparent, or potential OCOI is discovered after submission of its proposal, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual, apparent, or potential conflict. If the SEC discovers an actual or potential conflict after the award, it may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part. If the OCOI is discovered prior to the award and the SEC concludes, in its sole discretion, that the OCOI cannot be mitigated, there will not be an award made. If the Contractor did not disclose relevant information or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the SEC may terminate the contract for cause, debar the Contractor from SEC contracting, or pursue other remedies as may be permitted by law or by this contract. In protecting the SEC's integrity, the Contracting Officer is vested with the broadest possible discretion in determining whether an OCOI exists and what remedy is appropriate. For this contracting action, all that is required in finding such a conflict is some evidence that facts exist which could be alleged to constitute an actual or apparent conflict of interest. Accordingly, it is in each Contractor's best interest to fully inform the Contracting Officer as early as possible to allow the Contracting Officer the maximum opportunity to find ways to mitigate or resolve such potential conflicts of interest.

B.7

Submission of Invoices

The Securities and Exchange Commission accepts only electronic/e-mail invoices. Invoices shall be submitted on a monthly basis, after inspection and acceptance by SEC. Contractors should submit invoices in accordance with FAR 52.212-4. Contractors are cautioned against submitting an invoice prior to goods and services being received/accepted. Invoices submitted prematurely may be rejected. Electronic/e-mail Invoice Instructions: ˇ Invoices must be in PDF Format and may not exceed 10MB ˇ Subject Line: Company name and the invoice number ˇ e-mail Message: ˇ Company logo or letterhead ˇ Company name and payment address ˇ Company point of contact (POC) for the invoice with phone and e-mail ˇ Invoice Number ˇ SEC Contract or Order number ˇ SEC COR For services: contract line item number, item description, period of performance and associated costs.

The Government reserves the right to unilaterally change any of these individual assignments at any time. B.8.1 Contracting Officer (CO) (a) The Contracting Officer (CO) within the Office of Acquisitions has the overall responsibility for the administration of this contract. A warranted CO, within the limitations of his/her warrant, is the only authorized individual to take actions on behalf of the Government to amend, modify or deviate from the contract terms, conditions, requirements, specifications, details and/or delivery schedules. The CO may delegate certain specific responsibilities to its authorized representative--the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The CO may also designate an alternate COR for this contract.

At a minimum, the TO CO shall be responsible for: (1) Ensuring that task orders are within the scope of the contract; (2) Administering and final closeout of task orders; (3) Performing inspection and acceptance or rejection of the equipment/services provided by the Contractor; and (4) Making payment, withholds, or partial payment of Contract User invoices. In no event will a task order change the requirements of the contract. Should the Contract User require such a change, specific approval must first be obtained from the CO. B.8.2 DIO Program Manager The DIO Program Manager (DIO PM) is the Government individual responsible for overall DIOMDS program administration. The DIO PM is primarily responsible for strategizing and guiding the overall DIOMDS program to best satisfy the evolving needs of the SEC. The DIO PM is identified below: 6

The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and reports, and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract/order. The COR is not otherwise authorized to make any representations or commitments of any kind on behalf of the CO or the Government. The COR does not have authority to alter the Contractor's obligations or to change the contract/order specifications, price, terms or conditions. If, as a result of technical discussions, it is desirable to modify contract/order obligations or the specification, changes will be issued in writing and signed by the CO. B.9 Ordering

This section provides further detail into the ordering process specific to this contract, including how a orders will be solicited, processed, and awarded. This section also defines the role of the DIOMDS Task Order Ombudsman. B.9.1 Fair Opportunity Fair Opportunity will be provided for all orders, unless one of the exceptions at FAR Part 16.505(b) applies. The TO CO will solicit responses to potential offerors in accordance with this section, satisfying the requirement for Fair Opportunity to be considered.

(i) Orders exceeding $5 million. For TO RFP orders exceeding $5 million, in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1)(iii), the Government will also disclose the significant evaluation factors and subfactors (including relative importance), including cost or price, and will provide an opportunity for a postaward debriefing in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(4). (c) Proposals. Responses will not be a proposal as defined in FAR Part 15, but only sufficient information to be considered in accordance with FAR Part 16. Proposals shall not merely restate SOO, SOW or PWS requirements. Proposals shall address, as a minimum: Technical/Management Approach; Key Personnel Proposed; Quantities/Hours of Personnel by Labor Categories; Other Direct Costs (ODCs) (materials and supplies, travel, training, etc.); (5) Risks and Assumptions; (6) Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE)/Government-Furnished Information (GFI) required; (7) Security (including clearance level); (8) Teaming Arrangement (including subcontracting); (9) Other Pertinent Data, (e.g., potential conflict of interest issues); and (10) Price If additional information is required, it will be requested at the TO RFP level. (d) Pricing. When competing for TO awards under the Fair Opportunity process, the Contractor is permitted to propose labor rates that are lower than those originally proposed and established in this contract. The Contractor shall fully explain the basis for proposing lower rates. The proposed, reduced labor rates will not be subject to audit, however, the rates will be reviewed for realism to ensure the Government will not be placed at risk of nonperformance. The reduced labor rates will apply only to the respective task order and will not change the fixed rates in the contract. If additional labor categories not otherwise included in the contract are required to perform a task, a request for contract modification must be submitted to the Contracting Officer. This request must include information demonstrating the insufficiency of the Government's Labor Category, a description of the proposed labor category including the education and experience levels, proposed labor rates and a cross reference to other contracts that include the proposed labor categories. (1) (2) (3) (4)

8

DIOMDS Request For Proposal RFP No. SECHQ113R0004

For FFP type TOs, the quantity of each item or labor category ordered will be multiplied against the rate listed in this schedule or as negotiated for the TO, and the cumulative extended total of all items ordered will define the fixed price for the TO. Travel and ODCs, if applicable, may be estimated for each TO, burdened with the markup and profit percentages specified in this schedule. Any total rate negotiated for travel and ODCs will be added to the extended price of all ordered items to arrive at the total fixed price for the TO. Progress payments of FFP type TOs may be negotiated based on the completion of milestones. For T&M/LH type TOs, the quantity of hours ordered from each labor category will be specified as deliverable hours billable at the ceiling rates specified in this contract or as negotiated for the TO. Travel and ODCs will be estimated for each TO and burdened with the ODC markup percentage specified in this contract. Profit on travel and ODCs is not allowable. The cumulative extended total of all labor categories ordered plus travel and ODCs will define the TO ceiling price. The government will not reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred beyond the ceiling price, for hours not delivered, for hours delivered but in excess of the quantities ordered for a particular labor category or for travel and ODCs exceeding the ordered amount. Labor dollars will not be used to pay for ODCs nor ODC dollars used to pay for labor without a contract modification. (e) Evaluation of TO Proposals. In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(1)(iv)(B), formal evaluation plans or scoring of quotes or offers are not required for TO proposals. The Government will pursue streamlined evaluation procedures to the maximum extent practicable. The Contracting Officer will identify one or more individuals from the Program Office to provide support in evaluation of TO proposals, in order to insure that sufficient expertise is present, while lending itself to an efficient procurement. The Program Office individuals will provide the Contracting Officer with input as needed, in order to assist the Contracting Officer in making an award decision. Subject to the complexity of the effort, lengthy write-ups or formal reports are not required, nor are they preferred. The Government's award decision will be based, at a minimum, on selection criteria which addresses past performance, technical/management factors and price. (f) Resolution of Issues. In the event issues pertaining to a proposed task cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of the TO CO, the TO CO reserves the right to withdraw and cancel the proposed task. In such event, the TO CO will notify the Contractor of the decision in writing. This decision is final and conclusive and shall not be subject to the "Disputes" clause or the "Contract Disputes Act." B.9.3 TO Protests In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(10), no protest under Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an TO under this contract, except for: (i) A protest on the grounds that the order improperly increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or

(ii) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10 million. Protests of orders in excess of $10 million may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), in accordance with the procedures at FAR 33.104. B.9.4 Task Order Ombudsman (a) The TO Ombudsman responsibilities are to address Contractor concerns regarding compliance with the award procedures for task/delivery orders, review Contractor complaints on task/delivery order contracts, ensure all Contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for each task/delivery order, consistent with FAR 16.505(b), and when requested, maintain strict confidentiality of the Contractor requesting assistance.

B.11.2 6001.00 -SEC Non-Disclosure Requirements and Agreements (Jul 2012) Required non-disclosure agreements are attached and must be completed and returned to the Contracting Officer before starting work under this contract. Provisions of the SEC Regulation Concerning Conduct of Members and Employees and Former Members and Employees of the Commission expressly prohibit unauthorized disclosure and improper use of confidential or non-public information or documents. See 17 C.F .R. § 200.7353(b)(1) & (b)(2). The Contractor, and its employees, agents, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel who will have access to confidential or non-public information or documents in the performance of the contract, agree to be bound by the provisions of Sections 200.735-3(b)(1) and 200.735-3(b)(2) of the SEC's Regulation Concerning Conduct and the terms set forth in the attached non-disclosure agreements (Attachments 1& 2). For purposes of this clause, "confidential or non-public information," is defined as information generated by or in the possession of the SEC that is commercially valuable, trade secret, market sensitive, proprietary, related to an SEC enforcement or examination matter, subject to privilege, protected by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a), or otherwise deemed confidential or non-public by an SEC division director or office head, and is not otherwise available to the public. An officer or executive authorized to bind the Contractor shall execute the non-disclosure agreement (Attachment 1) on behalf of the Contractor and return it to the Contracting Officer prior to the Contractor commencing work on the contract. The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a list of its employees, agents, and subcontractors that will be authorized access to SEC information by virtue of performing the requirements set forth in this contract. Each person identified on the list shall then sign the non-disclosure agreement on behalf of themselves (Attachment 2) and submit it to the Contracting Officer before commencing work on the contract. The Contractor shall also ensure that all of its employees, agents, and subcontractors assigned to perform the requirements set forth in this contract adhere to the terms of the non-disclosure agreement, protecting all confidential or non-public information, and to not divulge to any unauthorized person. Assignment of staff who has not executed the non-disclosure agreement or failure to adhere to this statement shall result in action by the Contracting Officer, as deemed appropriate. Violation of this clause or the attached non-disclosure agreements by the Contractor, its employees, agents, subcontractors, or subcontractor personnel may result in default of the contract and/or civil suits and/or criminal prosecution.

B.11.3 Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (Jul 2012) The Contractor shall have established policies and procedures in place to safeguard SEC Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The policies and procedures shall provide the

11

DIOMDS Request For Proposal RFP No. SECHQ113R0004

Introduction The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission must provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other source. Section 3544(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) describes Federal agency security responsibilities as including "information systems used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other organization on behalf of an agency." This includes services which are either fully or partially provided; including other agency hosted, outsourced, and cloud computing solutions. Scope The security requirements identified in this guide are specific to contractor owned and operated systems on behalf of SEC or the Federal Government (when SEC is the managing agency). Federal agencies are responsible for ensuring information technology acquisitions comply with the information technology security requirements in the Federal Information Security Management Act (44 U.S.C. 3544), OMB's implementing policies including Appendix III of OMB Circular A-130, and guidance and standards from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

1.1 Required Policies and Regulations for SEC Contracts -Contractors entering into an agreement for services to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and/or its Federal customers shall be contractually subject to all SEC and Federal IT Security standards, policies, and reporting requirements. The contractor shall meet and comply with all SEC IT Security Policies and all applicable SEC and NIST standards and guidelines, other Government-wide laws and regulations for protection and security of Information Technology. All SEC contractors must comply with the SEC policies below (these documents are all referenced within the SEC IT Security program Policy). o SEC Regulation 24-04 "Information Technology (IT) Security Program" ° Appendix 24-04.A01 "Rules of the Road ­ Acceptable Use Policies" ° Operating Directive 24-04-06 "IT Security Access Management Program" ° Operating Directive 24.04.08 "IT Security Activities for Information System Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance" ° Operating Directive 24.04.10 "IT Security Compliance Program" o SEC Regulation 24-08 "Management and Protection of Privacy Act Records and other Personally Identifiable Information"

Purpose The purpose of this document is to define and establish consistent language for SEC IT acquisition contracts involving contractor owned and operated systems to ensure compliance with the appropriate provisions of FISMA, OMB Circular A-130, and NIST 80053 R3. Each of the sections below highlights a key element of SEC's IT security objectives for contractor acquisition efforts.

Contractors are also required to comply with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), the "Special Publications 800 series" guidelines published by NIST, and the requirements of FISMA. o Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. o Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 also known as the "Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996."

The offerors will receive a minimum of seven calendar days notice prior to the requested time for presentation and details describing the requirements for oral presentations. F.7 Release of Information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) / Redacted Proposals Increasingly, requests to Federal agencies under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) are being made for copies of technical and business proposals from other than Government sources. This subsection is intended to assist responsible Federal officials in deciding, and to expedite the decision, whether to disclose or withhold such information under the FOIA or otherwise. Technical, management, or cost proposals in the possession or control of an executive agency, which have been submitted by a firm in response to the requirements of a solicitation for a competitive proposal, may not be made available to any person under the FOIA, except when incorporated into a contract. 41 U.S.C. § 253b(m). The following obligation applies only if the Contractor's proposal is incorporated into the resulting contract, whether in whole or in part, and whether in full text or by reference. Within fifteen (15) days after contract award (unless such period is extended by the Contracting Officer in writing), the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer with a redacted copy of its proposal as negotiated (or at least such parts as have been incorporated into the contract), which, if released by the Government to the public, the Contractor shall express no objection and concerning which the Contractor shall waive any claim for legal, equitable, or administrative relief premised on such release. The Contractor shall annotate, or describe in writing separately, or both, each redaction with the FOIA exemption (e.g., exemption (b) (4) of the FOIA) or other legal ground that it contends the Government should assert for withholding release, including the basis for each redaction. For example, if the Contractor has made a redaction and contends that the underlying language should not be disclosed because it is "commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," the Contractor shall describe whether, why, and how disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to its competitive position and whether the information has ever been previously made available in unrestricted form to its knowledge. The submission shall include the name(s), title(s), and telephone number(s) of the individual(s) responsible for addressing

75

DIOMDS Request For Proposal RFP No. SECHQ113R0004

FOIA requests for the company. The Contractor agrees that it will provide all of this information free of charge to the Government. The Contractor agrees that it shall provide the same information to the Government with respect to order proposals incorporated into an order or the contract, upon the request of the Contracting Officer, under the same terms and free of charge. The Contractor is cautioned that, under the FOIA, no information is automatically exempt from public disclosure. However, no disclosure of information suggested for withholding by the Contractor will be made without careful evaluation. This subsection shall not be construed to in any way limit obligations, rights, or responsibilities of the Federal Government and its disclosure officers under statute, regulation, or executive order to assess and decide whether information can or should be disclosed under the FOIA or other disclosure statutes and regulations. In addition, this subsection shall not be construed to in any way limit or interfere with the procedure identified in Executive Order 12,600, as implemented by the SEC. F.8 6012.02 Section 508 Requirements (March 2011) Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in FAR 39.2.The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm. All EIT products must comply with the following standards. Descriptions of the standards are viewable at the link Section 508 Standards. ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 21-Software applications and operating systems ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 22-Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 26-Desktop and Portable Computers ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 31-Functional Performance Criteria ˇ 36 CFR 1194 Section 41-Information, documentation, and support Offerors that fail to demonstrate compliance with the above standards, or provide equivalent salient characteristics, may be eliminated from further consideration for award. Respondents to this solicitation must provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products and/or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products and/or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 standards, and it is later determined by the Government ­ i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products and/or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the contract will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

The offeror o does o does not certify that-- (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.

For purposes of this Agreement, "confidential or non-public information," is defined as information generated by or in the possession of the SEC that is commercially valuable, trade secret, market sensitive, proprietary, related to an SEC enforcement or examination matter, subject to privilege, protected by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a), or otherwise deemed confidential or non-public by an SEC division director or office head, and is not otherwise available to the public.

B. The Contractor acknowledges that any conditional access to SEC confidential and nonpublic information is granted to Contractor for the sole purpose of performing its obligations under SEC Contract ___________________ (the "underlying Contract").

E. In accordance with the SEC Regulation at 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(2)(i), the Contractor, for itself and its employees, agents, and subcontractors, agrees not to disclose to any unauthorized person or release in advance of authorization for its release, any confidential or non-public document or information: (1) protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. §§ 552, 552a, and 552b or any rules or regulations of the SEC; or (2) in circumstances where the SEC has determined to accord such information confidential treatment, unless the SEC authorizes the disclosure of such information as provided for under 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(2)(ii).

Intending to be legally bound, I, ________________________, hereby accept the obligations contained in this Agreement in consideration of being granted conditional access to SEC confidential and non-public information to include personally identifiable information (PII). For purposes of this Agreement, "confidential or non-public information," is defined as information generated by or in the possession of the SEC that is commercially valuable, trade secret, market sensitive, proprietary, related to an SEC enforcement or examination matter, subject to privilege, protected by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a), or otherwise deemed confidential or non-public by an SEC division director or office head, and is not otherwise available to the public.

This Agreement does not grant me access to information or materials that the SEC determines in its sole discretion is inappropriate for disclosure. C. I acknowledge that the SEC Regulation Concerning Conduct of Members and Employees and Former Members and Employees of the Commission expressly prohibits the improper use and unauthorized disclosure of confidential or non-public information or documents. See 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(1) & (b)(2) available at http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/textidx?c=ecfr&rgn=div5&view=text&node=17:2.0.1.1.1&idno=17#17:2.0.1.1.1.13.3.3. I agree to be bound by the prohibitions of § 200.735-3(b)(1) & (b)(2) and the terms set forth herein. I agree not to disclose to any unauthorized person any confidential or non-public documents or information to which I have access in the performance of duties under the underlying Contract. D. In accordance with the SEC Regulation at 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(1), I agree not to engage, directly or indirectly, in any personal business transaction or private arrangement for personal profit the opportunity for which arises because of my performance under the Contract, or that is based upon confidential or non-public information which I gain in the course of my performance under the Contract.

Attachment 7 ­ Labor Categories
All orders issued against this contract will be priced in accordance with this section. The labor rates in this section reflect the fully-burdened rates for each labor category and will apply to all direct labor hours. The labor rates are fixed for all contract year periods, and are not subject to any escalation through the course of the ordering periods. The labor rates and Other Direct-Costs (ODCs) mark-up percentages are detailed herein under labor categories and ODCs, respectively. The loaded hourly rates are ceiling price rates and the Contractor may, at its discretion, elect to propose lower hourly rates on a task by task basis. (a) Labor. The Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) Rate Table represents fully-loaded hourly rates for each skill classification. The fully-burdened labor rates include all direct, indirect, general and administrative costs and profit associated with providing the required skill. The fully-burdened labor rates include all labor and labor-related costs, including, but not limited to, the following list of representative labor-related costs: salaries, wages, bonuses to include stock bonuses, incentive awards, employee stock options, stock appreciation rights, employee stock ownership plans, employee insurance, fringe benefits, contributions to pension, other postretirement benefits, annuity, employee incentive compensation plans, incentive pay, shift differentials, overtime, vacation time, sick pay, holidays, and all other allowances based upon a comprehensive employee compensation plan. The use of uncompensated overtime is not encouraged. All hourly rates are based on a 40-hour work-week (ex. 1,920 hours per year or in accordance with the Contractor's Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Disclosure Statement). (1) Government Site Rates. When performing at Government sites, the Contractor shall furnish fully-burdened labor rates. The Government will provide only office space, furniture, and office equipment and supplies, as described in the contract and as specified in the individual Task Orders (TO). (2) Contractor Site Rates. When performing at a Contractor site, the Contractor shall furnish fully-burdened labor rates which include loads for office space and all normal supplies and services required to support the work. This includes, but is not limited to, telephones, faxes, copiers, personal computers, postage (to include courier services such as Federal Express), ordinary business software (e.g., word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, etc.), normal copying and reproduction costs. (b) Other Direct Costs. ODCs consist of materials, subcontractor (other than labor) and task order-related travel costs, e.g., relocation and temporary duty (TDY) to include travel, lodging and meals. These percentages are indicated in this section under the ODC rates. The cost of general-purpose items required for the conduct of the Contractor's normal business operations will not be considered an allowable ODC in the performance of task orders under this contract. Profit is not allowed on ODCs under a Time & Materials/Labor Hour (T&M/LH) type task order. (c) DIOMDS Program Management Support Costs. Contract-level program management support costs encompass support for contract-level management, reporting requirements and related travel and meeting attendance costs associated with the Contractor's program management staff, as it relates to overall management of the DIOMDS Program. As a result, 1

these program management support costs shall be included within each fully burdened labor category rate, and shall not be proposed as separate labor categories. The contract-level "program management" support costs are differentiated from individual task order `Program Manager" or "Project Manager" support costs, which specifically support project management for individual task orders. The task order "Program Manager" or "Project Manager" support labor hours are billed at hourly labor rates against individual task orders for direct support to the effort performed under those task orders. This will result in direct billings at the task order level. (e) Additional Labor Categories.
