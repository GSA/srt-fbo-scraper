   identify such sales accordingly.

(2)   Show your total projected annual sales to the Government under this contract for the contract term, excluding options, for each SIN
   offered.  If you currently hold a Federal Supply Schedule contract for the SIN the total projected annual sales should be based on your most
   recent 12 months of sales under that contract.

      (c)   Do any deviations from your written policies or standard commercial sales practices disclosed in the chart in paragraph 4(a) ever
       result in better prices than indicated?  YES ____ NO_____.  If YES, explain deviations in accordance with the instructions at Figure 515.4-
       2, which is provided in this solicitation for your convenience.


                                        Figure 515.4-2—Instructions for Commercial Sales Practices Format

If you responded “YES” to question (3), on the COMMERCIAL SALES PRACTICES FORMAT, complete the chart in question (4)(a) for the customer(s) who
receive your best price.  If you responded “NO” complete the chart in question (4)(a) showing your written policies or standard sales practices
for all customers or customer categories to whom you sell at a price that is equal to or better than the price(s) offered to the Government
under this solicitation or with which the Offeror has a current agreement to sell at a price which equals or exceeds the price(s) offered under
this solicitation.  Such agreement shall be in effect on the date the offer is submitted or contain an effective date during the proposed
multiple award schedule contract period.  If your offer is lower than your price to other customers or customer categories, you will be aligned
with the customer or category of customer that receives your best price for purposes of the Price Reduction clause at 552.238-75.  The
Government expects you to provide information required by the format in accordance with these instructions that is, to the best of your
knowledge and belief, current, accurate, and complete as of 14 calendar days prior to its submission.  You must also disclose any changes in
your price list(s), discounts, prices and/or policies that occur after the offer is submitted, but before the close of negotiations.  If your
pricing practices vary, the variations should be explained clearly to include a description of the circumstance, frequency, and selling terms
and conditions.  You may limit the information reported to those services that exceed 75% of actual historical Government sales (commercial
sales may be substituted if Government sales are unavailable) value of the special item number (SIN).

Column 1—Identify the applicable customer or category of customer.  A "customer" is any entity which acquires supplies or services from the
Offeror.  The term customer includes, but is not limited to state and local governments, educational institutions (an elementary, junior high,
or degree granting school which maintains a regular faculty and established curriculum and an organized body of students), national accounts,
and end users.  In any instance where the Offeror is asked to disclose information for a customer, the Offeror may disclose information by
category of customer if the offeror's pricing policies or practices are the same for all customers in the category.  (Use a separate line for
each customer or category of customer.)

Column 2—Identify the price.  Indicate the best price (based on your written pricing policies or standard commercial pricing practices if you do
not have written pricing policies) at which you sell to the customer or category of customer identified in column 1, without regard to quantity;
terms and conditions of the agreements; and whether the agreements are written or oral.  If the price is a combination of various discounts
(prompt payment, quantity, etc.), each type of discount should be fully identified and explained.  If the price lists which are the basis of the
discounts given to the customers identified in the chart are different than the price list submitted upon which your offer is based, identify
the type or title and date of each price list.  The contracting officer may require submission of these price lists.  To expedite evaluation,
offerors may provide these price lists at the time of submission.  If market prices are used, provide documentation to substantiate pricing
(e.g., agreements with corporate customers, internal policies, market prices, quote sheets, pricing agreements and invoices, etc.) and identify
the effective period, pricing and any other terms and conditions clearly.  If prices are based on cost, provide information other than certified
cost or pricing data to show how the offeror arrived at the proposed price.   A price certification is not required.  If rates are audited by a
Federal Agency, include this information in the narrative.  Disclosures should be made on a separate sheet.

Column 3—Identify the quantity or volume of sales.  Insert the minimum quantity or sales volume which the identified customer or category of
customer must either purchase/order, per order or within a specified period for the best price.  When purchases/orders must be placed within a
specified period to get the best price, indicate the time period.

Column 4—Indicate concessions regardless of quantity granted to the identified customer or category of customer.  Concessions are defined in
solicitation clause 552.212-70, Preparation of Offers (Multiple Award Schedule).  If the space provided is inadequate, the disclosure should be
made on a separate sheet by reference.

Columns 5-8—Fill in the requested information.  If you respond “YES” to question 4 (c) in the Commercial Sales Practices Format, provide an
explanation of the circumstances under which you deviate from your written policies or standard commercial sales practices disclosed in the
chart on the Commercial Sales Practices Format and explain how often they occur.  Your explanation should include a discussion of situations
that lead to deviations from standard practice, an explanation of how often they occur, and the controls you employ to assure the integrity of
your pricing.  If deviations from your written policies or standard commercial sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales
Practices Format are so significant and/or frequent that the Contracting Officer cannot establish whether the price(s) offered is fair and
reasonable, then you may be asked to provide additional information.  The Contracting Officer may ask for information to demonstrate that you
have made substantial sales of the item(s) in the commercial market consistent with the information reflected on the chart on the Commercial
Sales Practice Format, a description of the conditions surrounding those sales deviations, or other information that may be necessary in order
for the Contracting Officer to determine whether your offered price(s) is fair and reasonable.  In cases where additional information is
requested, the Contracting Officer will target the request in order to limit the submission of data to that needed to establish the
reasonableness of the offered price.

   before agreeing to a modification, to the manufacturer’s sales records for the purpose of verifying the information submitted by the
   manufacturer.  The information is required in order to enable the Government to make a determination that the offered price is fair and

If you responded “YES” to question (3), on the COMMERCIAL SALES PRACTICES FORMAT, complete the chart in question (4)(a) for the customer(s) who
receive your best discount.  If you responded “NO” complete the chart in question (4)(a) showing your written policies or standard sales
practices for all customers or customer categories to whom you sell at a price (discounts and concessions in combination) that is equal to or
better than the price(s) offered to the Government under this solicitation or with which the Offeror has a current agreement to sell at a
discount which equals or exceeds the discount(s) offered under this solicitation.  Such agreement shall be in effect on the date the offer is
submitted or contain an effective date during the proposed multiple award schedule contract period.  If your offer is lower than your price to
other customers or customer categories, you will be aligned with the customer or category of customer that receives your best price for purposes
of the Price Reduction clause at 552.238-75.  The Government expects you to provide information required by the format in accordance with these
instructions that is, to the best of your knowledge and belief, current, accurate, and complete as of 14 calendar days prior to its submission.
You must also disclose any changes in your price list(s),  discounts and/or discounting policies which occur after the offer is submitted, but
before the close of negotiations.  If your discount practices vary by model or product line, the discount information should be by model or
product line as appropriate.  You may limit the number of models or product lines reported to those which exceed 75% of actual historical
Government sales (commercial sales may be substituted if Government sales are unavailable) value of the special item number (SIN).

Column 1—Identify the applicable customer or category of customer.  A "customer" is any entity, except the Federal Government, which acquires
supplies or services from the Offeror.  The term customer includes, but is not limited to original equipment manufacturers, value added
resellers, state and local governments, distributors, educational institutions (an elementary, junior high, or degree granting school which
maintains a regular faculty and established curriculum and an organized body of students), dealers, national accounts, and end users.  In any
instance where the Offeror is asked to disclose information for a customer, the Offeror may disclose information by category of customer if the
offeror's discount policies or practices are the same for all customers in the category.  (Use a separate line for each customer or category of
customer.)

Column 2—Identify the discount.  The term “discount” is as defined in solicitation clause 552.212-70, Preparation of Offer (Multiple Award
Schedule).  Indicate the best discount (based on your written discounting policies or standard commercial discounting practices if you do not
have written discounting policies) at which you sell to the customer or category of customer identified in column 1, without regard to quantity;
terms and conditions of the agreements under which the discounts are given; and whether the agreements are written or oral.  Net prices  or
discounts off of other price lists should be expressed as percentage discounts from the price list which is the basis of your offer.  If the
discount disclosed is a combination of various discounts (prompt payment, quantity, etc.), the percentage should be broken out for each type of
discount.  If the price lists which are the basis of the discounts given to the customers identified in the chart are different than the price
list submitted upon which your offer is based, identify the type or title and date of each price list.  The contracting officer may require
submission of these price lists.  To expedite evaluation, offerors may provide these price lists at the time of submission.

Column 3—Identify the quantity or volume of sales.  Insert the minimum quantity or sales volume which the identified customer or category of
customer must either purchase/order, per order or within a specified period,  to earn the discount.  When purchases/orders must be placed within
a specified period to earn a discount indicate the time period.

Column 4—Indicate the FOB delivery term for each identified customer.  See FAR 47.3 for an explanation of FOB delivery terms.

Column 5—Indicate concessions regardless of quantity granted to the identified customer or category of customer.  Concessions are defined in
solicitation clause 552.212-70, Preparation of Offers (Multiple Award Schedule).  If the space provided is inadequate, the disclosure should be
made on a separate sheet by reference.

If you respond “YES” to question 4 (b) in the Commercial Sales Practices Format, provide an explanation of the circumstances under which you
deviate from your written policies or standard commercial sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices Format and
explain how often they occur.  Your explanation should include a discussion of situations that lead to deviations from standard practice, an
explanation of how often they occur, and the controls you employ to assure the integrity of your pricing.  Examples of typical deviations may
include, but are not limited to, one time goodwill discounts to charity organizations or to compensate an otherwise disgruntled customer; a
limited sale of obsolete or damaged goods; the sale of sample goods to a new customer; or the sales of prototype goods for testing purposes.

If deviations from your written policies or standard commercial sales practices disclosed in the chart on the Commercial Sales Practices Format
are so significant and/or frequent that the Contracting Officer cannot establish whether the price(s) offered is fair and reasonable, then you
may be asked to provide additional information.  The Contracting Officer may ask for information to demonstrate that you have made substantial
sales of the item(s) in the commercial market consistent with the information reflected on the chart on the Commercial Sales Practice Format, a
description of the conditions surrounding those sales deviations, or other information that may be necessary in order for the Contracting
Officer to determine whether your offered price(s) is fair and reasonable.  In cases where additional information is requested, the Contracting
Officer will target the request in order to limit the submission of data to that needed to establish the reasonableness of the offered price.





                                                                   Enclosure A

(To determine if the public has access to the compensation information, see the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission total compensation filings at http://www.sec.gov/answers/execomp.htm.) (d) (1) If the Contractor in the previous tax year had gross income, from all sources, under $300,000, the Contractor is exempt from the requirement to report subcontractor awards.

requirement. (e) In order to effectively implement this plan to the extent consistent with efficient contract performance, the Contractor shall perform the following functions: (1) Assist small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns by arranging solicitations, time for the preparation of bids, quantities, specifications, and delivery schedules so as to facilitate the participation by such concerns. Where the Contractor's lists of potential small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors are excessively long, reasonable effort shall be made to give all such small business concerns an opportunity to compete over a period of time. (2) Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in all "make-or-buy" decisions. (3) Counsel and discuss subcontracting opportunities with representatives of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business firms. (4) Confirm that a subcontractor representing itself as a HUBZone small business concern is identified as a certified HUBZone small business concern by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database or by contacting SBA. (5) Provide notice to subcontractors concerning penalties and remedies for misrepresentations of business status as small, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, or women-owned small business for the purpose of obtaining a subcontract that is to be included as part or all of a goal contained in the Contractor's subcontracting plan. (6) For all competitive subcontracts over the simplified acquisition threshold in which a small business concern received a small business preference, upon determination of the successful subcontract offeror, the Contractor must inform each unsuccessful small business subcontract offeror in writing of the name and location of the apparent successful offeror prior to award of the contract. (f) A master plan on a plant or division-wide basis that contains all the elements required by paragraph (d) of this clause, except goals, may be incorporated by reference as a part of the subcontracting plan required of the offeror by this clause; provided -- (1) the master plan has been approved, (2) the offeror ensures that the master plan is updated as necessary and provides copies of the approved master plan, including evidence of its approval, to the Contracting Officer, and (3) goals and any deviations from the master plan deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to satisfy the requirements of this contract are set forth in the individual subcontracting plan. (g) A commercial plan is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial items. The commercial plan shall relate to the offeror's planned subcontracting generally, for both commercial and Government business, rather than solely to the Government contract. Once the Contractor's commercial plan has been approved, the Government will not require another subcontracting plan from the same Contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the Contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial item. A Contractor with a commercial plan shall comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (d)(10) of this clause by submitting one SSR in eSRS for all contracts covered by its commercial plan.

Reports are required when due, regardless of whether there has been any subcontracting activity since the inception of the contract or the previous reporting period. (ii) When a subcontracting plan contains separate goals for the basic contract and each option, as prescribed by FAR 19.704(c), the dollar goal inserted on this report shall be the sum of the base period through the current option; for example, for a report submitted after the second option is exercised, the dollar goal would be the sum of the goals for the basic contract, the first option, and the second option. (iii) The authority to acknowledge receipt or reject the ISR resides -- (A) In the case of the prime Contractor, with the Contracting Officer; and (B) In the case of a subcontract with a subcontracting plan, with the entity that awarded the subcontract. (2) SSR. (i) Reports submitted under individual contract plans -- (A) This report encompasses all subcontracting under prime contracts and

For DoD, a consolidated report shall be submitted for all contracts awarded by military departments/ agencies and/or subcontracts awarded by DoD prime Contractors. However, for construction and related maintenance and repair, a separate report shall be submitted for each DoD component. (D) For DoD and NASA, the report shall be submitted semi-annually for the six months ending March 31 and the twelve months ending September 30. For civilian agencies, except NASA, it shall be submitted annually for the twelve month period ending September 30. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period.

(B) The report shall be submitted annually, within thirty days after the end of the Government's fiscal year.

(D) The authority to acknowledge or reject SSRs for commercial plans resides with the Contracting Officer who approved the commercial plan. (iii) All reports submitted at the close of each fiscal year (both individual and commercial plans) shall include a Year-End Supplementary Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses. The report shall include subcontract awards, in whole dollars, to small disadvantaged business concerns by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsector. If the data are not available when the year-end SSR is submitted, the prime Contractor and/or subcontractor shall submit the Year-End Supplementary Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses within 90 days of submitting the year-end SSR. For a commercial plan, the Contractor may obtain from each of its subcontractors a predominant NAICS Industry Subsector and report all awards to that subcontractor under its predominant NAICS Industry Subsector.

52.222-41
52.222-41 SERVICE CONTRACT ACT OF 1965 (NOV 2007)
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause­ Act means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). Contractor when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." Service employee means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary

Page: 55 of 113

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

of Labor or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2) (i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv) (A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed.

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

(C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with subparagraphs (b)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of Compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under the contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to Furnish Fringe Benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum Wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor Contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to

Page: 57 of 113

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

or after the award of a contract or subcontract. 53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and Sanitary Working Conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employee. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act-- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor will permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay Periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or

Page: 58 of 113

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semimonthly. (k) Withholding of Payments and Termination of Contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may either enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective Bargaining Agreements Applicable to Service Employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority List. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent prime Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Ruling and Interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's Certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, Tolerances, and Exemptions Involving Employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor,

Page: 59 of 113

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business. (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR Parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR Parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision-- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes Concerning Labor Standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR Parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract.

If no such determination has been made applicable to this contract, then the Federal minimum wage as established by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, (29 U.S.C. 206) current on the anniversary date of a multiple year contract or the beginning of each renewal option period, shall apply to this contract. (d) The contract price, contract unit price labor rates, or fixed hourly labor rates will be adjusted to reflect the Contractor's actual increase or decrease in applicable wages and fringe benefits to the extent that the increase is made to comply with or the decrease is voluntarily made by the Contractor as a result of: (1) The Department of Labor wage determination applicable on the anniversary date of the multiple year contract, or at the beginning of the renewal option period. For example, the prior year wage determination required a minimum wage rate of $4.00 per hour. The Contractor chose to pay $4.10. The new wage determination increases the minimum rate to $4.50 per hour. Even if the Contractor voluntarily increases the rate to $4.75 per hour, the allowable price adjustment is $.40 per hour; (2) An increase or decrease wage determination otherwise applied to the contract by operation of

law; or (3) An amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 that is enacted after award of this contract, affects the minimum wage, and becomes applicable to this contract under law. (e) Any adjustment will be limited to increases or decreases in wages and fringe benefits as described in paragraph (d) of this clause, and the accompanying increases or decreases in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but shall not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit. (f) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any increase claimed under this clause within 30 days after receiving a new wage determination unless this notification period is extended in writing by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of any decrease under this clause, but nothing in the clause shall preclude the Government from asserting a claim within the period permitted by law. The notice shall contain a statement of the amount claimed and the change in fixed hourly rates (if this is a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract), and any relevant supporting data, including payroll records, that the Contracting Officer may reasonably require. Upon agreement of the parties, the contract price, contract unit price labor rates, or fixed hourly rates shall be modified in writing. The Contractor shall continue performance pending agreement on or determination of any such adjustment in its effective date. (g) The Contracting Officer or an authorized representative shall have access to and the right to examine any directly pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the Contractor until the expiration of 3 years after final payment under the contract.

52.222-46 EVALUATION OF COMPENSATION FOR PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES (FEB 1993)
(a) Recompetition of service contracts may in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished professional employees. This lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance. It is therefore in the Government's best interest that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR 541, be properly and fairly compensated. As part of their proposals, offerors will submit a total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract. The Government will evaluate the plan to assure that it reflects a sound management approach and understanding of the contract requirements. This evaluation will include an assessment of the offeror's ability to provide uninterrupted high-quality work. The professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact upon recruiting and retention, its realism, and its consistency with a total plan for compensation. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure. (b) The compensation levels proposed should reflect a clear understanding of work to be performed and should indicate the capability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and keep suitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must take into account differences in skills, the complexity of various disciplines, and professional job difficulty. Additionally, proposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and availability of required competent professional service employees. Offerors are cautioned that lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement. (c) The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. Professional compensation that is unrealistically low or not in reasonable relationship to the various job categories, since it may impair the Contractor's ability to attract and retain competent professional service employees, may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend the complexity of

the contract requirements. (d) Failure to comply with these provisions may constitute sufficient cause to justify rejection of a proposal.

Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. (i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the

format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.

52.232-34 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other than Central Contractor Registration (MAY 1999) (DEVIATION ­ FEB 2007)
(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the ordering activity under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT) except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. (2) In the event the ordering activity is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either-- (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or (ii) Request the ordering activity to extend payment due dates until such time as the ordering activity makes payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). (b) Mandatory submission of Contractor's EFT information. (1) The Contractor is required to provide the ordering activity with the information required to make payment by EFT (see paragraph (j) of this clause). The Contractor shall provide this information directly to the office designated in this contract to receive that information (hereafter: "designated office") by To Be Determined at the Task Order Level . If not otherwise specified in this contract, the payment office is the designated office for receipt of the Contractor's EFT information. If more than one designated office is named for the contract, the Contractor shall provide a separate notice to each office. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the designated office(s). (2) If the Contractor provides EFT information applicable to multiple contracts, the Contractor shall specifically state the applicability of this EFT information in terms acceptable to the designated office. However, EFT information supplied to a designated office shall be applicable only to contracts that identify that designated office as the office to receive EFT information for that contract. (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The ordering activity may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210. (d) Suspension of payment. (1) The ordering activity is not required to make any payment under this contract until after receipt, by the designated office, of the correct EFT payment information from the Contractor. Until receipt of the correct EFT information, any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. (2) If the EFT information changes after submission of correct EFT information, the ordering activity shall begin using the changed EFT information no later than 30 days after its receipt by the designated office to the extent payment is made by EFT. However, the Contractor may request that no further payments be made until the updated EFT information is implemented by

Page: 85 of 113

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

the payment office. If such suspension would result in a late payment under the prompt payment terms of this contract, the Contractor's request for suspension shall extend the due date for payment by the number of days of the suspension. (e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the ordering activity used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the ordering activity remains responsible for-- (i) Making a correct payment; (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of ordering activity release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and-- (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the ordering activity is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the ordering activity shall not make payment and the provisions of paragraph (d) shall apply. (f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. (g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall provide the EFT information required by paragraph (j) of this clause to the designated office, and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the ordering activity, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The ordering activity is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information provided by the Contractor's financial agent. (i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The ordering activity may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the ordering activity does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the ordering activity. If the ordering activity makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the ordering activity shall mail the payment information to the remittance address in the contract. (j) EFT information. The Contractor shall provide the following information to the designated office. The Contractor may supply this data for this or multiple contracts (see paragraph (b) of this clause). The Contractor shall designate a single financial agent per contract capable of receiving and processing

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

the EFT information using the EFT methods described in paragraph (c) of this clause. (1) The contract number (or other procurement identification number). (2) The Contractor's name and remittance address, as stated in the contract(s). (3) The signature (manual or electronic, as appropriate), title, and telephone number of the Contractor official authorized to provide this information. (4) The name, address, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the Contractor's financial agent. (5) The Contractor's account number and the type of account (checking, saving, or lockbox). (6) If applicable, the Fedwire Transfer System telegraphic abbreviation of the Contractor's financial agent. (7) If applicable, the Contractor shall also provide the name, address, telegraphic abbreviation, and 9-digit Routing Transit Number of the correspondent financial institution receiving the wire transfer payment if the Contractor's financial agent is not directly on-line to the Fedwire Transfer System; and, therefore, not the receiver of the wire transfer payment.

52.232-36
52.232-36 PAYMENT BY THIRD PARTY (FEB 2010) (DEVIATION ­ MAY 2003)
(a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to accept payments due under this contract, through payment by a third party in lieu of payment directly from the ordering activity, in accordance with the terms of this clause. The third party and, if applicable, the particular credit card to be used are identified elsewhere in this contract. (2) The credit card is not authorized as a method of payment during any period of the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) indicates that the Contractor has delinquent debt that is subject to collection under the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). Information on TOP is available at http://fms.treas.gov/debt/index.html. If the CCR subsequently indicates that the Contractor no longer has delinquent debt, the Contractor may request the Contracting Officer to authorize payment by credit card. (b) Contractor payment request. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall make payment requests through a charge to the ordering activity account with the third party, at the time and for the amount due in accordance with those clauses of this contract that authorize the Contractor to submit invoices, contract financing requests, other payment requests, or as provided in other clauses providing for payment to the Contractor. (2) When the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor that the credit card is no longer an authorized method of payment, the Contractor shall make such payment requests in accordance with instructions provided by the Contracting Officer during the period when the purchase card is not authorized. (c) Payment. The Contractor and the third party shall agree that payments due under this contract shall be made upon submittal of payment requests to the third party in accordance with the terms and conditions of an agreement between the Contractor, the Contractor's financial agent (if any), and the third party and its agents (if any). No payment shall be due the Contractor until such agreement is made. Payments made or due by the third party under this clause are not payments made by the

ordering activity and are not subject to the Prompt Payment Act or any implementation thereof in this contract. (d) Documentation. Documentation of each charge against the ordering activity's account shall be provided to the Contracting Officer upon request. (e) Assignment of claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, if any payment is made under this clause, then no payment under this contract shall be assigned under the provisions of the assignment of claims terms of this contract or the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940, as amended, 31 U.S.C. 3727, 41 U.S.C. 15. (f) Other payment terms. The other payment terms of this contract shall govern the content and submission of payment requests.

52.232-37
52.232-37 MULTIPLE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS (MAY 1999)
This contract or agreement provides for payments to the Contractor through several alternative methods.

52.233-1
52.233-1 DISPUTES (JUL 2002)
(a) This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613). (b) Except as provided in the Act, all disputes arising under or relating to this contract shall be resolved under this clause. (c) "Claim," as used in this clause, means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking, as a matter of right, the payment of money in a sum certain, the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other relief arising under or relating to this contract. However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim under the Act until certified. A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under the Act. The submission may be converted to a claim under the Act, by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as to liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time. (d) (1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer. (2) (i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000. (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim. (iii) The certification shall state as follows: "I certify that the claim is made in good faith;

Page: 88 of 113

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor." (3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim. (e) For Contractor claims of $50,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For Contractor-certified claims over $50,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made. (f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act. (g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the offer. (h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having defective certifications, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the Act, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim. (i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.

The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this clause. Upon receipt of the order, the Contractor shall immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work stoppage. Upon receipt of the final decision in the protest, the Contracting Officer shall either-- (1) Cancel the stop-work order; or (2) Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of this contract. (b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled either before or after a final decision in the protest, the Contractor shall resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if-- (1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and

Page: 89 of 113

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

(2) The Contractor asserts its right to an adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon the request at any time before final payment under this contract. (c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement. (d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order. (e) The Government's rights to terminate this contract at anytime are not affected by action taken under this clause. (f) If, as the result of the Contractor's intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2), or 33.104(h)(1), the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs. In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of Subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government.

52.237-1
52.237-1 SITE VISIT (APR 1984)
Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable.

52.237-10
52.237-10 IDENTIFICATION OF UNCOMPENSATED OVERTIME (OCT 1997)
(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-- Uncompensated overtime means the hours worked without additional compensation in excess of an average of 40 hours per week by direct charge employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. Compensated personal absences such as holidays, vacations, and sick leave shall be included in the normal work week for purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours. Uncompensated overtime rate is the rate that results from multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the proposed hours per week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20 per hour would be converted to an uncompensated overtime rate of $17.78 per hour ($20.00 x 40 divided by 45=$17.78). (b) For any proposed hours against which an uncompensated overtime rate is applied, the offeror shall

Page: 90 of 113

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

identify in its proposal the hours in excess of an average of 40 hours per week, by labor category at the same level of detail as compensated hours, and the uncompensated overtime rate per hour, whether at the prime or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct. (c) The offeror's accounting practices used to estimate uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost accounting practices used to accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours. (d) Proposals that include unrealistically low labor rates, or that do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism, will be considered in a risk assessment and will be evaluated for award in accordance with that assessment. (e) The offeror shall include a copy of its policy addressing uncompensated overtime with its proposal.

52.237-2
52.237-2 PROTECTION OF GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND VEGETATION (APR 1984)
The Contractor shall use reasonable care to avoid damaging existing buildings, equipment, and vegetation on the Government installation. If the Contractor's failure to use reasonable care causes damage to any of this property, the Contractor shall replace or repair the damage at no expense to the Government as the Contracting Officer directs. If the Contractor fails or refuses to make such repair or replacement, the Contractor shall be liable for the cost, which may be deducted from the contract price.

The plan shall specify a training program and a date for transferring responsibilities for each division of work described in the plan, and shall be subject to the Contracting Officer's approval. The Contractor shall provide sufficient experienced personnel during the phase-in, phase-out period to ensure that the services called for by this contract are maintained at the required level of proficiency. (c) The Contractor shall allow as many personnel as practicable to remain on the job to help the successor maintain the continuity and consistency of the services required by this contract. The Contractor also shall disclose necessary personnel records and allow the successor to conduct on-site interviews with these employees. If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor shall release them at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of their earned fringe benefits to the successor. (d) The Contractor shall be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed period after contract expiration that result from phase-in, phase-out operations) and a fee (profit) not to exceed a pro rata portion of the fee (profit) under this contract.

REGULATIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

(b) Maximum practicable utilization of small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. The General Services Administration (GSA) expects that an offeror's subcontracting plan will reflect a commitment to assuring that small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns are provided the maximum practicable opportunity, consistent with efficient contract performance, to participate as subcontractors in the performance of the resulting contract. An offeror submitting a commercial products plan can reflect this commitment through subcontracting opportunities it provides that relate to the offeror's production generally; i.e., for both its commercial and Government business. (c) GSA believes that this potential contract provides significant opportunities for the use of small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Consequently, in addressing the eleven elements described at FAR 52.219-9(d) of the clause in this contract entitled Small Business Subcontracting Plan, the offeror shall: (1) Demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in performing the contract. (2) Include a description of the offeror's subcontracting strategies used in any previous contracts, significant achievements, and how this plan will build upon those earlier achievements. (3) Demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small business subcontracting program's objectives and GSA's expectations, and it is committed to taking those actions necessary to meet these
goals or objectives.

(d) In determining the acceptability of any subcontracting plan, the Contracting Officer will take each of the following actions: (1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror demonstrates an understanding of the small business subcontracting program's objectives and GSA's expectations with respect to the program and has included all the information, goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219-9. (2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the same industry. (3) Consider information and potential sources obtained from agencies administering national and local preference programs and other advocacy groups in evaluating whether the goals stated in the plan adequately reflect the anticipated potential for subcontracting to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns. (4) Review the offeror's description of its strategies, historical performance and significant achievements in placing subcontracts for the same or similar products or services with small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns. The offeror's
description can apply to commercial as well as previous Government contracts.

(e) Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan and/or correct deficiencies in a plan within the time specified by the Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award.

(a) Reporting of Federal Supply Schedule Sales. The Contractor shall report all contract sales under this contract as follows: (1) The Contractor shall accurately report the dollar value, in U.S. dollars and rounded to the nearest whole dollar, of all sales under this contract by calendar quarter (January 1-March 31, April 1-June 30, July 1-September 30, and October 1-December 31). The dollar value of a sale is the price paid by the Schedule user for products and services on a Schedule task or delivery order. The reported contract sales value shall include the Industrial Funding Fee (IFF).

(iv) Payment. (2) Contract sales shall be reported to FSS within 30 calendar days following the completion of each reporting quarter. The Contractor shall continue to furnish quarterly reports, including "zero" sales, through physical completion of the last outstanding task order or delivery order of the contract. (3) Reportable sales under the contract are those resulting from sales of contract items to authorized users unless the purchase was conducted pursuant to a separate contracting authority such as a Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC); a separately awarded FAR Part 12, FAR Part 13, FAR Part 14, or FAR Part 15 procurement; or a non-FAR contract. Sales made to state and local governments under Cooperative Purchasing authority shall be counted as reportable sales for IFF purposes. (4) The Contractor shall electronically report the quarterly dollar value of sales, including "zero" sales, by utilizing the automated reporting system at an Internet website designated by the General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Supply Service (FSS). Prior to using this automated system, the Contractor shall complete contract registration with the FSS Vendor Support Center (VSC). The website address, as well as registration instructions and reporting procedures, will be provided at the time of award. The Contractor shall report sales separately for each National Stock Number (NSN), Special Item Number (SIN), or sub-item. (5) The Contractor shall convert the total value of sales made in foreign currency to U.S. dollars using the "Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange" issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Financial Management Service. The Contractor shall use the issue of the Treasury report in effect on the last day of the calendar quarter. The report is available from Financial Management Service, International Funds Branch, Telephone: (202) 874-7994, Internet: http://www.fms.treas.gov/intn.html. (b) The Contractor shall remit the IFF at the rate set by GSA's FSS. (1) The Contractor shall remit the IFF to FSS in U.S. dollars within 30 calendar days after the end of the reporting quarter; final payment shall be remitted within 30 days after physical completion of the last outstanding task order or delivery order of the contract. (2) The IFF represents a percentage of the total quarterly sales reported. This percentage is set at the discretion of GSA's FSS. GSA's FSS has the unilateral right to change the percentage at any time, but not more than once per year. FSS will provide reasonable notice prior to the effective date of the change. The IFF reimburses FSS for the costs of operating the Federal Supply Schedules Program and recoups its operating costs from ordering activities. Offerors must include the IFF in their prices. The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities. FSS will post notice of the current IFF at http://72a.fss.gsa.gov/ or successor website as appropriate. (c) Within 60 days of award an FSS representative will provide the Contractor with specific written procedural instructions on remitting the IFF. FSS reserves the unilateral right to change such instructions from time to time, following notification to the Contractor. (d) Failure to remit the full amount of the IFF within 30 calendar days after the end of the applicable reporting period constitutes a contract debt to the United States Government under the terms of FAR Subpart 32.6. The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or setting off payments and interest on the debt (see FAR clause 52.232-17, Interest). Should the Contractor fail to submit the required sales reports, falsify them, or fail to timely pay the IFF, this is sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the contract for cause.

Supporting pricing documentation may consist of copies of invoices, contracts, quote sheets, etc. and MUST be included in the Offer.  There must be a clear and relevant relationship between the supporting document and the proposed price it is meant to substantiate.  The Government will attempt negotiation of a more favorable markup in comparison to the contractor’s MFC.


TO ALL PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS
We appreciate your interest in the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Program. Under the FSS Program, the General Services Administration and the
Department of Veterans Affairs (GSA/VA) establish long-term Governmentwide contracts with commercial firms to provide ordering activities with
access to a wide variety of commercial supplies and/or services. This letter provides pertinent background information on the FSS Program. You
should consider this information prior to deciding whether to submit an offer for an FSS contract. Please read this letter in its entirety to
learn about the benefits and responsibilities associated with being an FSS contractor. You will then be better informed to determine if
obtaining an FSS contract is the right business decision for your firm.
To help with the education process on Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) GSA has designed a “Vendor Toolbox” in the vendor support center which will
walk a suppler through researching, analyzing, and deciding whether it is the best business decision to pursue an MAS contract. If the supplier
decides to become an offeror, it provides an understanding of the steps that need to be taken to be successful in the Federal marketplace
https://vsc.gsa.gov/. Once on the VSC website, select the “Toolbox” tab which will take you to the “Vendor Toolbox”. The FSS Program is designed
to enable ordering activities to purchase commercial supplies and/or services quickly, efficiently, at fair and reasonable prices and still meet
all the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The commercial supplies and/or services awarded under FSS contracts are
divided into approximately 32 distinct schedules. In total, there are approximately 19,000 FSS contracts in place with more added daily,
covering over 11 million supplies and/or services.
AbilityOne Program
The AbilityOne Program is a federal procurement program that generates jobs for individuals who are blind or have another significant disability
through the manufacturing of products or the provision of services required by federal personnel. Products and services on the AbilityOne
Procurement List are mandatory for use by federal customers. The mandatory source requirement of the AbilityOne Program as outlined by the
Javits-Wagner-O’Day (JWOD) Act (41 U.S.C. 46 – 48c) must be adhered by all schedule holders. Certain commercial products are considered
“essentially the same” (ETS) as AbilityOne products. Because the AbilityOne products are mandatory purchases for federal customers, contractors
are required to remove the commercial ETS items from its offer. If you offer products that are ETS as AbilityOne products, you are encouraged to
become an authorized distributor of AbilityOne products. For more information on the AbilityOne Program and how to become an authorized
distributor, please visit https://www.abilityone.gov/. Point of contact at the AbilityOne Program is Mr. Eric Beale at ebeale@abilityone.gov or
(703) 603-2119.
Becoming a successful FSS contractor requires that your company take a few key steps. The first step to success under the FSS Program is to
perform due diligence and understand your commitments and obligations as an FSS contractor. Companies that have prepared well, understand their
commitments and obligations, and have plans to meet those commitments and obligations have thrived under the FSS Program.
The next step is to select the schedule that best aligns to the commercial supplies and/or services your company wants to offer. This action can
be accomplished by accessing GSA eLibrary at www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov. Under the "Schedules Contracts" box on the right, select "View Schedules
Contracts" to view the complete list of schedules. By clicking on any schedule number, you can then view the generic categories of supplies
and/or services under a particular schedule. For more information about GSA eLibrary, go to www.gsa.gov/elibrary/. Detailed information on
selecting the schedule(s) that best aligns to your offering can be found in the “Vendor Toolbox” located at https://vsc.gsa.gov/ under the
“Toolbox” tab.
Once you have determined the proper schedule under which to submit your offer, the next step is to download, read, and understand the
solicitation. You may access this solicitation by clicking on "Vendors: Click here to view the current solicitation on FedBizOpps," which is
located on each individual schedule's page. It is essential to read the entire schedule solicitation. Understanding the terms and conditions of
an FSS contract and your contractual obligations is critical to your success as an FSS contract holder.
You can also download the solicitation directly from FedBizOpps by accessing www.fedbizopps.gov. From the FedBizOpps website, you may search by
GSA Office, VA National Acquisition Center, Solicitation Number, or Keyword. We encourage you to visit both GSA eLibrary and FedBizOpps, since
each site provides important news and information.
Please note that the award of an FSS contract does NOT guarantee future sales and it is up to you to market your company. Although the FSS
Program provides significant benefits to ordering activities, they are not required to use the FSS Program to fulfill their requirements. With
thousands of contracts already in place, competition for orders under the FSS Program is fierce.
HOW TO DECIDE IF A FSS CONTRACT IS RIGHT FOR YOU
First, take the mandatory "Pathway to Success" free education seminar and test. "Pathway to Success" is designed to assist prospective FSS
contractors in making informed business decisions as to whether obtaining an FSS contract is in their best interest. The presentation also
provides background information on the FSS Program. You may attend either a live presentation or complete the web based presentation. To
complete the seminar online, go to the Vendor Support Center (VSC) at https://vsc.gsa.gov. Once on the VSC website, select "Pathway to Success"
under the "Training" or the “Toolbox” tab. Email pathwaytosuccess@gsa.gov to gain more information on how to attend a live presentation. The
seminar includes topics such as expectations of vendors, how to compete and succeed as a schedule contractor, how to develop a schedule-specific
business plan, and how to submit a quality offer.
Next, take the mandatory “Readiness Assessment” free self evaluation. The “Readiness Assessment” is designed to assist prospective offerors in
researching, analyzing, and deciding whether they are able to compete as an FSS contractor. The mandatory “Readiness Assessment” is a
downloadable form that is in the VSA at https://vsc.gsa.gov/ and resides in the “Vendor Toolbox”. Once on the VSC website, select the “Toolbox”
tab located between “Home” and “Getting on Advantage”. This tool will help your firm understand the amount of time and money that is needed to
be a successful FSS contractor. It is required that this assessment be signed by an officer of your firm who is authorized to commit and is
mandatory before submitting an offer. It is important that your firm understand the solicitation clauses and requirements such as past
performance, and certifications, etc. Therefore it is suggested that an officer carefully read and review the solicitation to which your firm
will be responding PRIOR to completing this assessment. The assessment contains a combination of “Yes/No” and short answer questions. Each
question will reference a step in the vendor toolbox that will assist your firm in researching, analyzing and deciding if you are ready to
become a MAS schedule contractor.
Next, locate the "New Contactor Orientation" webcast under the "Vendor Training" tab on the Vendor Support Center (VSC) website. The webcast was
developed to define key contract requirements with which a vendor must comply and outlines how GSA/VA evaluates FSS contract performance. While
visiting the VSC, also review The Steps to Success: Make the Most of your GSA Contract under the "Publications" tab. This document provides an
overview of FSS contract requirements, including key reporting documents. Both learning tools are highly recommended reading, as they provide
information for you to confidently comply with contractual obligations and ensure that you are ready to be an excellent FSS contractor. For more
information about the VSC, visit https://vsc.gsa.gov.
Also, you can identify and assess your competition. This important task can be accomplished by visiting GSA eLibrary at
http://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/ElibMain/home.do and GSA Advantage!® at https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/main/start_page.do. In addition to
providing access to schedule solicitations, GSA eLibrary is our online source for FSS contract award information; GSA Advantage!® is our online
shopping and ordering system. Both websites contain information regarding the supplies and/or services that current FSS contractors offer. The
information collected from these websites should assist you in identifying potential competitors under the FSS Program. The knowledge gained
from this effort will help you assess your firm's ability to compete, if awarded an FSS contract. Your review of the competition should include:
competitors' pricing, delivery times, warranty terms, services, and any other elements that make their offerings distinctive. For more
information about GSA Advantage!®, visit https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/main/start_page.do.
Another online tool for assessing your FSS Program competition is Schedule Sales Query (SSQ) at http://ssq.gsa.gov. SSQ provides detailed sales
information on current FSS contractors. On this site, you can search to see if your competitors have successfully sold similar supplies and/or
services under the FSS Program. For more information on SSQ, visit www.gsa.gov/schedulesalesquery.
Your review and analysis of the preceding websites should allow you to assess the competitive environment for the supplies and/or services you
want to provide. Once you understand the requirements which you will have to follow and the market in which you will have to operate, you can
then decide whether a FSS contract is the right business investment for your firm.
We recommend that you become familiar with the Federal procurement proposal evaluation factors. At a minimum, Government buyers will evaluate
price and past performance, and possibly your firm's expertise in providing the supplies and/or services you are seeking to offer. Purchasers
under the FSS Program make a selection of an FSS contractor based upon "best value." FAR 2.101 defines "best value" as the expected outcome of
an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.
An important criteria to consider is whether the items you propose are compliant with the Trade Agreements Act, which can be found at
http://acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2025_4.html#wp1086589. The Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 2501, et seq.) is the enabling
statute that implements numerous multilateral and bilateral international trade agreements and other trade initiatives. Since the estimated
dollar value of each schedule exceeds the established Trade Agreements Act (TAA) threshold, the TAA is applicable to all schedules. In
accordance with the TAA, only U.S.-made or designated country end products shall be offered and sold under schedule contracts. For the
definition of "designated country," go to http://acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2025_1.html#wp1118780.
GSA offers ordering activity buyers training and provides them with informational material about the benefits of the FSS Program. Such benefits
include the following:
    • Acquisition lead time is reduced.
    • Wide selection of state-of-the-art commercial supplies and/or services.
    • Schedule orders are not required to be synopsized.
    • GSA has already determined schedule prices to be fair and reasonable
Although GSA/VA provide informational material on the benefits of the FSS Program, GSA/VA do not market or promote specific contracts,
distribute products of individual firms, or steer business to any individual contractor. If awarded a FSS contract, you will be required to
market your supplies and/or services to ordering activities. You will be required to upload an approved schedule price list on GSA Advantage!®.
Since purchasing authority is spread out across all ordering activities, marketing your supplies and/or services may not be an easy task. You
are strongly encouraged to target markets and build relationships in much the same way you market to commercial customers. Finally, how well you
perform under your FSS contract is up to you.
If you decide to submit an offer and are awarded an FSS contract, be advised that GSA will require your sales to exceed $25,000 within the first
24 months after your contract is awarded. Your company will then be expected to exceed $25,000 in sales each succeeding 12 month period in order
to retain your FSS contract. If your company is newly established or has had low sales in the supplies and/or services you want to offer under
the FSS Program, you should consider the difficulty you may have in meeting this performance requirement. If you ultimately decide to submit an
offer under the FSS Program, having a business plan to meet this performance requirement will be critical to ensuring your success as an FSS
contractor.
YES, I WANT TO SUBMIT AN OFFER
Excellent! GSA/VA are always looking for highly qualified firms to increase competition and serve the needs of the ordering activities. While
not all firms are awarded FSS contracts, the FSS Program, in accordance with statutory authority, is open to all responsible offerors. To be
considered for award of an FSS contract, you must demonstrate that your firm meets all FSS Program requirements, including a reasonable and
competitive price. To understand the term responsible, please refer to FAR 9.104-1, which identifies the standards a prospective contractor must
posses to be determined responsible. To read FAR 9.104-1, go to http://acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%209_1.html#wp1084076.
Currently, the time required to evaluate and award an FSS contract can range from three to six months. Well prepared and documented offers with
competitive pricing are easier to evaluate and may expedite the award process.
GSA has developed eOffer, a web based application that allows an offeror to prepare and submit an FSS offer electronically. eOffer is designed
to create an interactive, secure environment that simplifies the contracting process, from submission of offer to contract award. eOffer uses
the latest digital authentication technology to ensure the integrity of data and to electronically sign the offer. Digital certificates are
required in order to use eOffer. The eOffer website at http://eoffer.gsa.gov contains a variety of information regarding the eOffer application,
including available training, and information regarding digital certificates. It is required that eOffer be used to submit an offer. For more
information on eOffer, visit www.gsa.gov/eoffer.
Once you submit an offer, GSA will look for a number of items. We will verify that you have submitted all the required information necessary to
evaluate your offer. The following are key elements of your offer that will be reviewed:
    • Pricing
    • Past performance
    • Scope -- the supplies/services are within the scope of the Schedule solicitation
    • Financial capability
    • Technical
    • Subcontracting Plan (if you are not a small business concern)
    • Other regulatory compliance
Good Luck. We want you to be successful, and look forward to the start of a long and successful partnership.
NO, I DO NOT WANT TO SUBMIT AN OFFER RIGHT NOW. WHAT OTHER OPTIONS DO I HAVE FOR FEDERAL BUSINESS?
If you decide an FSS contract is not a good fit for your firm at this time, you can still participate in other Federal Government acquisitions.
In some cases, pursuing other avenues may be even more advantageous.
Other Government contracting opportunities are posted on FedBizOpps at www.fedbizopps.gov. Commercial vendors seeking Federal markets can
search, monitor, and retrieve solicitations for supplies and services issued by all Federal agencies. The FAR addresses the circumstances under
which an acquisition of supplies and/or services with an estimated dollar value exceeding $3,000 but not over the simplified acquisition
threshold gives preference to small business concerns.
Business concerns may also participate in subcontracting opportunities with companies already under contract to the Federal Government. The U.S.
Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov) provides information on subcontracting, as well as other topics of interest to firms seeking
business opportunities. Existing schedule contractors are always looking for opportunities to subcontract to small business, small disadvantaged
business, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business
concerns.
Remember, the FSS Program is continually open. If you have determined the FSS Program is not the correct contracting vehicle for your firm at
this time, we encourage you to periodically revisit your business plan and the opportunity to market your supplies and/or services under the FSS
Program at a later date.
Thank you for taking the time to learn about the FSS Program. We wish you great success in whatever method you chose to market to Government
agencies.
COVER PAGE TO MODEL SUBCONTRACTING PLAN



Notice to Offerors:  GSA provides this model plan as a tool.  You must adapt this model plan to fit your subcontracting situation.  The plan is NOT a fill-in-the-blank form and you must remove instructional language.  This model does not establish minimum requirements for an acceptable plan.  The model reflects objectives GSA encourages contractors to adopt.  GSA expects offerors to thoroughly review the requirements set forth in FAR 19.704, Subcontracting Plan Requirements and FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan before submitting their subcontracting plans.



Definitions of Types of Plans:



______ COMMERCIAL PLAN:  Covers the offeror’s fiscal year and applies to the entire production of commercial items sold by either the entire company or a portion thereof (e.g., division, plant, or product line.)  Note that this type of plan shall relate to the offeror’s planned subcontracting generally, for both commercial and government business, rather than solely to the government contract.  Per FAR 19.704(d) and clause 52.219-9(g), this is the preferred type of plan for contractors furnishing commercial items. Once a contractor’s commercial plan has been approved, the Government shall not require another subcontracting plan from the same contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial item.  The contractor shall—  (1) Submit the commercial plan to either the first contracting officer awarding a contract subject to the plan during the contractor’s fiscal year, or, if the contractor has ongoing contracts with commercial plans, to the contracting officer responsible for the contract with the latest completion date. The contracting officer shall negotiate the commercial plan for the Government. The approved commercial plan shall remain in effect during the contractor’s fiscal year for all Government contracts in effect during that period; (2) Submit a new commercial plan, 30 working days before the end of the Contractor’s fiscal year, to the contracting officer responsible for the uncompleted Government contract with the latest completion date. The contractor must provide to each contracting officer responsible for an ongoing contract subject to the plan, the identity of the contracting officer that will be negotiating the new plan; (3) When the new commercial plan is approved, provide a copy of the approved plan to each contracting officer responsible for an ongoing contract that is subject to the plan; and (4) Comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (a)(10) of this section by submitting one SSR in eSRS, for all contracts covered by its commercial plan. This report will be acknowledged or rejected in eSRS by the contracting officer who approved the plan. The report shall be submitted within 30 days after the end of the Government’s fiscal year. 

 

______ INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT PLAN:  Covers the entire contract period, applies to a specific contract, and has goals that are based on the offeror’s planned subcontracting (and purchasing) in support of the specific contract, except that indirect costs incurred for common or joint purposes may be allocated on a prorated basis to the contract.  For contracts with option periods, the plan will include separate goals and estimated value (or sales) for the base period with separate goals and estimated value for each option period.  Per FAR 52.219-9(c) this type of plan must separately address subcontracting with small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business concerns, small disadvantaged business (including ANCs and Indian Tribes), and women-owned small business concerns, with a separate part for the basic contract and separate parts for each option (if any). The plan shall be included in and made a part of the resultant contract. The subcontracting plan shall be negotiated within the time specified by the Contracting Officer. Failure to submit and negotiate the subcontracting plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.  The Contractor shall submit the Individual Subcontract Report (ISR), and the Summary Subcontract Report (SSR) using the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) (), following the instructions in the eSRS and in accordance with FAR clause 52.219-9.

______ MASTER PLAN:  Contains all the required elements of an individual contract plan, except goals, and may be incorporated into individual contract plans, provided the master plan has been approved.  A master plan on a plant or division-wide basis that contains all the elements, except goals, may be incorporated by reference as a part of the subcontracting plan required of the offeror by the clause 52.219-9; provided (1) The master plan has been approved; (2) The offeror ensures that the master plan is updated as necessary and provides copies of the approved master plan, including evidence of its approval, to the Contracting Officer; and (3) Goals and any deviations from the master plan deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to satisfy the requirements of this contract are set forth in the individual subcontracting plan. A contract may have no more than one plan.  When a modification meets the criteria in FAR 19.702 for a plan, or an option is exercised, the goals associated with the modification or option shall be added to those in the existing subcontracting plan.  The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith with the clause at FAR 52.219-8 or an approved plan required by FAR 52.219-9 shall be a material breach of the contract.  The Contractor shall submit the Individual Subcontract Report (ISR), and the Summary Subcontract Report (SSR) using the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) (), following the instructions in the eSRS and in accordance with FAR clause 52.219-9.





GSA SUBCONTRACTING GOALS (How to do the math tips)



Subcontracting goals are subject to change, based on recent achievement levels and as negotiated with the Small Business Administration (SBA).  SBA is responsible for the Federal Government Goaling Program and their website at  includes details and background on the goaling process.



Total estimated subcontracting dollars (or spend) planned to all types of business concerns must be provided, then separately state the dollars that will be subcontracted to each category.  All percents for each category will be expressed as a percentage of the total subcontracting dollars to all concerns (both large and small)*.  

The Small business dollar amount must include all sub-group category amounts; i.e., HUBZone, SDB, WOSB, VOSB, SDVOSB (plus any "other small" businesses that do not fall within one of these specified subgroups). Again note that Alaskan Native Corporations (ANCs) and Indian tribes will be included in the SDB and total small amounts.

*Only the large plus all small should equal the total in both dollars and percents.  Do not add together subgroups to reach the total Small figure, as the same dollars can be double and triple counted for each group as applicable to the company receiving the order.

		Sample Dollars			   GSA Goal (FY 2012-13)
Total dollars to be subcontracted	     $1,000,000				100%
    (to both Large and Small Businesses)
*To Large Businesses	     $  700,000*				*70%
*To all Small Businesses	     $  250,000*				*25%
    (includes HUBZone Small, Small Disadvantaged,
Women-Owned Small, Veteran-Owned Small, Service-Disabled 
Veteran-Owned Small, and Other Small Business Concerns)

	To HUBZone Small Businesses	     $    30,000			    3%
	To Small Disadvantaged Businesses	     $    50,000			    5%
	To Women-Owned Small Businesses	     $    50,000			    5%
	To Veteran-Owned Small Businesses	     $    30,000			    3%
                  (includes SDVOSB below in this total)
	To Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses	     $    30,000			    3%


NOTE:  The total $250,000 to all Small businesses already includes each subgroup (HUBZone, SDB, ANCs, WOSB, VOSB, and SDVOSB), plus other small businesses that are only small and do not fall into a specified category.

III.	GOALS:



A. The FAR clause at 52.219-9(d) states that the subcontracting plan shall include (1) goals, expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars, for the use of small business concerns as subcontractors; and (2) A statement of total dollars planned to be subcontracted for an individual contract plan; or the offeror’s total projected sales, expressed in dollars, and the total value of projected subcontracts to support the sales for a commercial plan.  FAR 19.704(a)(1) requires separate percentage goals for using small business (including Alaskan Native Corporations (ANCs) and Indian tribes), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business (including ANCs and Indian tribes) and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors; and (2) A statement of the total dollars planned to be subcontracted and a statement of the total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small business (including ANCs and Indian tribes), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business (including ANCs and Indian tribes) and women-owned small business concerns. Commercial plans will always reflect annual company wide goals.  Individual plans will reflect contract-specific goals and shall contain separate statements and goals for the basic contract (period) and separately for each option (period).  Note that dollars and percentages to large and total small businesses (all inclusive) must equal the total subcontracted to all categories in both dollars and percentages.  EACH CONTRACTOR IS EXPECTED TO OFFER THE MAXIMUM PRACTICABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO EACH TYPE OF SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN CONSISTENT WITH THEIR BEST FAITH EFFORTS AND SUPPORTED BY THEIR REPORTS AND RECORDS.

Check all that apply below, ensuring that at least one item is indicated for each column.  If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact your local Small Business Administration Commercial Market Representative via www.sba.gov/localresources, or access the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Dynamic Small Business Search database at .  You may also post solicitations for small business opportunities on SBA’s SUB-Net at  .

A firm may rely on the information contained in CCR as an accurate representation of a concern’s size and ownership characteristics for the purposes of maintaining SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone, SDB, and WOSB source list. Use of CCR as its source list does not relieve a firm of its responsibilities (e.g., outreach, assistance, counseling, or publicizing subcontracting opportunities) in this clause.





[Company Name] identifies potential subcontractors using the following source lists and organizations:

PLEASE NOTE: ALL RESPONSES SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AS EOFFERS (http://eoffer.gsa.gov). NOTICE: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. NOTICE CONCERNING MODIFICATIONS TO ALL CONTRACTS AWARDED UNDER THIS SOLICITATION: GSA WILL ONLY ACCEPT MODIFICATION REQUESTS SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AS EMODS (http://eoffer.gsa.gov). The following link provides guidance on utilizing the eOffer and eMod systems, obtaining digital certificates, and using the eOffer and eMod Training Guides: http://eoffer.gsa.gov -----------Announcement Regarding CCR, ORCA and ELPS----------The Government is in the process of transitioning to the System for Award Management (SAM), which is a new system that will combine multiple individual federal procurement systems currently used into one single entry point system. As SAM becomes operational, vendors will be required to utilize SAM in place of legacy systems. While there is not yet a set date for SAM implementation, Phase 1 is expected to go live in late July 2012. Once Phase 1 is active, "System for Award Management (SAM)" should be substituted for any references in this solicitation to the legacy systems listed below. The web address for SAM is www.sam.gov. - Central Contractor Registration (CCR) - Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) - Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) Future phases will include additional procurement systems such as eSRS, FBO and others.

index of applicable wage determinations for this solicitation and resultant contract are shown in FedBizOpps document "SCA Index of Wage Determinations." The full text version of each wage determination can be viewed at www.wdol.gov. Some of the proposed labor categories may be subject to the SCA (usually nonprofessional categories). As such, it is important that the offeror verifies that its proposed base rates and fringe benefit rates for these labor categories meet or exceed the SCA wage determination rates and fringe benefits for the areas where the offeror expects to perform the majority of work under the contract. (ii) A contract must meet only the base rate and fringe benefit rate requirements in the SCA Wage Determination (WD) Revision Number currently incorporated into the GSA Contract. The WD Revision Number in the GSA contract takes precedence over any WD Revision Number an agency incorporates into an RFQ at the Task Order Level.

(iii) Identify the SCA wage determination(s), including determination number, revision date, state and counties that were used to determine that the rates offered are in compliance. The revision numbers of the wage determinations listed in the solicitation index of wage determinations should be used in the comparisons. See the sample below for how labor categories subject to the SCA are to be submitted as part of the GSA proposal. Labor category titles and rates are shown for example purposes only.

"The Service Contract Act (SCA) is applicable to this contract and it includes SCA applicable labor categories. The prices for the indicated (**) SCA labor categories are based on the U.S. Department of Labor Wage Determination Number(s) identified in the SCA matrix. The prices offered are based on the preponderance of where work is performed and should the contractor perform in an area with lower SCA rates, resulting in lower wages being paid, the task order prices will be discounted accordingly." (vii) (A) There are three methods for determining price adjustments of Service Contract Act (SCA) eligible labor categories ONLY. The offeror will be required to select one method for the life of the contract. (1) Method 1: Price Adjustment for the base contract period and all options exercised shall be in accordance with clause 52.222-43, Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Act Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option Contracts).

(2) Method 2: An escalation method is negotiated prior to award in accordance with the clause I-FSS-969,Economic Price Adjustment FSS Multiple Award Schedule, utilizing any of the methods available in the solicitation under that clause. (3) Method 3: When the offered prices are based upon a commercial price list, then only revisions in the commercial price list will enable the contractor to revise prices. They will only be allowed increases in accordance with clause 552.216-70, Economic Price Adjustment FSS Multiple Award Schedule Contracts. (B) Regardless of the method used ,contractor must ensure that within 30 calendar days after the effective date of any modification to revise pricing based on changes in the applicable wage determination(s), the electronic catalog is updated on GSA Advantage!Ž.

Part I - GOODS & SERVICES
SCOPE OF SCHEDULE 541, ADVERTISING AND INTEGRATED MARKETING SOLUTIONS (AIMS) OVERVIEW: Under the GSA Schedules Program (also referred to as Multiple Award Schedules and Federal Supply Schedules), GSA establishes long-term government-wide contracts with commercial firms to provide access to over four million commercial services and products. These can be ordered directly from GSA Schedule contractors or through GSA Advantage! On-line shopping and ordering system. PURPOSE: The purpose of this Advertising & Integrated Marketing Solutions (AIMS) Solicitation is to provide a full range of services to enable Federal agencies to meet their communication needs. The primary objective of this schedule is to satisfy the current and emerging needs that cannot be met through "in-house" personnel. The Schedule is intended to promote public awareness of government initiative and individual agency's missions, public understanding of complex technical and social issues and dissemination of information to industry and consumer advocacy groups. This Schedule also supports Executive Order 12367, "Productivity Improvement for the Federal Government," which called for the establishment of a Government-wide program to improve the quality, timeliness, and efficiency of services provided by the Federal Government. SCOPE OF SERVICES: The Contractor shall be capable of providing services for ordering agencies with multiple organizational levels and geographic locations nationwide and/or worldwide. The Contractor shall also be capable of handling multiple task orders simultaneously. The Contractor will be responsible for designing and implementing internal, local, national and/or international campaigns to inform the public of various issues, including but not limited to: recruitment needs, disaster information, educational needs, drug awareness, medical and retirement programs, and/or any other aspect of an agency's mission. The Contractor shall provide Advertising & Integrated Marketing Solutions as specified in individual task orders placed by ordering agencies. These services include but are not limited to: the preparation of written text, artwork, graphics, and other creative work (to include advertising and public messages), as well as placing the creative work in magazines, newspapers, pamphlets, and brochures on radio and television and/or other media avenues. The Contractor may be required to assess the educational needs of a target audience, compare them to the needs addressed by current public information reports, and address any changes that must be made. In addition, the Contractor shall have the knowledge and technical expertise in any subject matter. The contractor shall have the ability to write about a variety of topics along with having an understanding of the highly complex technical, legal, and social issues inherent to Government policy and public awareness campaigns. These services may also include providing direct support for the writing and editing of materials, which may include video, radio, television, public service announcements, appropriate talent, pamphlets, brochures, leaflets and web pages/sites. The Contractor shall provide all actors/actresses as required, unless the Federal activity chooses otherwise for print work and/or videos. The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining all necessary permits and licenses and for complying with all applicable Federal, State, and Municipal laws. The Contractor may not retain or use any material produced under a Task Order for self-promotion, except by written permission of the ordering agency. The Contractor shall provide all media in a format that is compatible with the ordering agency's requirements, including software. The Contractor shall be responsible for furnishing all items used in performing the Task Order unless otherwise specified or approved by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor will act independently and not as an agent of the Government. The Contractor shall furnish all services, experienced personnel, materials, equipment, and/or facilities in accordance with the specific requirements outlined in the Task Order issued by the individual agency. The Contractor shall initiate work only when directed by a Task Order and which has been signed by a Contracting Officer from the ordering agency. Upon termination or completion of all work under the Task Order, the Contractor shall comply with the agency's requirements for disposal. NOTE 1: Personal Services Contracts as defined in FAR 37.101 and FAR 37.104 are strictly prohibited. Agencies are prohibited from utilizing service contracts to augment government staff. A contractor is equally

Page: 1 of 77

7FCB-H2-070541-B Refresh: 14 Part I - GOODS & SERVICES

prohibited from knowingly offering to supplement government staff by engaging in a personal services contract/task order. NOTE 2: Architect-Engineering (A/E) Services as that term is defined in FAR 36.601-4 are excluded from the Schedules Program. If the agency's statement of work, substantially or to a dominant extent, specifies performance or approval by a registered licensed architect or engineer for services related to real property, the Brooks Architect-Engineers Act applies and such services must be procured in accordance with FAR Part 36. Use of this schedule for Brooks Act architectural or engineering services is not authorized. ORDERING PROCEDURES FOR SERVICES: Orders placed against a GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) contract, using the procedures under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.4, are considered to be issued under full and open competition (see FAR 6.102(d)(3)). Ordering offices do not need to seek further competition, synopsize the requirement, make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing or consider small business programs. By placing an order against a GSA Schedule contract using the procedures in this section, the ordering office has concluded that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative to meet the government's needs. OTHER DIRECT COSTS: The contractor shall provide all resources including personnel, management, supplies, services, materials, equipment, facilities, and transportation necessary to provide a wide range of advertising and integrated marketing services as specified in each task order. Labor categories, supplies, services, materials, equipment, transportation, etc., which support the overall performance of advertising and integrated marketing services procured under the Advertising & Integrated Marketing Solutions schedule, are considered other direct costs (ODCs). Authorized users shall procure ODCs only in support of the schedule contractor's overall advertising and integrated marketing services effort. No authorized user shall place orders only to procure the schedule contractor's ODCs. OVERSEAS DIFFERENTIAL PAY: The purpose of this provision is to describe how overseas differential pay will be handled on any task orders issued pursuant to Federal Supply Schedule contracts for services. Definition: Overseas differential pay includes many types of allowances, including Post (Cost of Living) Allowance, Post (Hardship) Differential, Living Quarter Allowance, Education Allowance, Foreign Per Diem, and Danger Pay Allowance. Contractor personnel may be required to perform services in areas designated by the Department of State as Danger Pay or Hardship Posts for a variety of reasons, including contingency operations, humanitarian or peacekeeping operations, military exercises and/or operations, or diplomatic missions. The Department of State's Standardized Regulations (DSSR) provides the regulations governing allowances, differentials (i.e. Hardship Post and/or Danger Pay) and definitions for all designated areas for all U.S. Government civilian employees. The DSSR provides for additional compensation for service in foreign locations where conditions of environment differ so substantially from conditions of environment in the continental U.S. that additional compensation is warranted and necessary as a recruitment or retention incentive. For U.S. Government civilian employees, hired in the United States, these are cumulative with a maximum of 35 percent each over the basic pay. (The cumulative maximum differential is 70 percent over basic pay, for an overall compensation of 170 percent of base pay.) Applicability to contract performance: In order to facilitate contractor performance in areas where these differentials may be appropriate, this provision allows the use of the State Department regulations and allowances as a basis for establishing differential labor rates on task orders. Information on current rates is available at the U.S. Department of State, Office of Allowances web site (http://aoprals.state.gov/Web920/default.asp?menu_id=95 ). If payment of a differential is determined appropriate by the task order contracting officer, that contracting officer may utilize any method to determine the labor rate (or additional price if pricing is based on other than labor rates) actually paid to the contractor. However, in no event shall the total price paid exceed the Schedule contract price plus the State Department compensation rate applicable to the locality in question. Example: A task order is contemplated with performance in Kabul, Afghanistan. As of the date of the

Page: 2 of 77

7FCB-H2-070541-B Refresh: 14 Part I - GOODS & SERVICES

contractors quotation, the State Department allowance for this location is 70%. The contract rate for the labor category in question is $100.00 per hour. Therefore, the maximum allowable differential rate for that labor category would be $170.00 per hour. DIGITAL CERTIFICATE(S): Offerors must obtain a Level 3 Digital Authentication Certificate in order to access the eOffer system. Currently the only acceptable digital certs are: Iden Trust and Operational Research Consultants (ORC). In order to facilitate the timely processing of your offer and administration of the resultant contract, you should have at least one (1) person who is an employee of the company with a digital certificate who is authorized to negotiate and sign on behalf of the company. All authorized negotiators must be identified in K-FSS-1 "Authorized Negotiators (March 1998). For information and instructions on obtaining digital certificates, visit the eOffer website (http://eoffer.gsa.gov). -----------Announcement Regarding CCR, ORCA and ELPS----------The Government is in the process of transitioning to the System for Award Management (SAM), which is a new system that will combine multiple individual federal procurement systems currently used into one single entry point system. As SAM becomes operational, vendors will be required to utilize SAM in place of legacy systems. While there is not yet a set date for SAM implementation, Phase 1 is expected to go live in late July 2012. Once Phase 1 is active, "System for Award Management (SAM)" should be substituted for any references in this solicitation to the legacy systems listed below. The web address for SAM is www.sam.gov. - Central Contractor Registration (CCR) - Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) - Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) Future phases will include additional procurement systems such as eSRS, FBO and others. Visit the SAM website for additional information.

From time to time, the Contractor may receive a rated order under this contract from a Delegate Agency. The Contractor must give preferential treatment to rated orders as required by the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulation (15 CFR part 700).

Rated orders take preference over all unrated orders as necessary to meet required delivery dates. There are two levels of ratings designated by the symbol of either "DO" or "DX." All "DO" rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over unrated orders. All "DX" rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over "DO" rated orders and unrated orders. The rating designation is followed by a program identification symbol. Program identification symbols indicate which approved program is supported by the rated order (see Schedule 1 of 15 CFR part 700 for a list of Delegate Agencies, approved programs, and program identification symbols).

(a) If an entity identified in paragraph (d) of the clause at 552.238-78, Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities)-- Alternate I, elects to place an order under this contract, the entity agrees that the order shall be subject to the following conditions: (1) When the Contractor accepts an order from such an entity, a separate contract is formed which incorporates by reference all the terms and conditions of the Schedule contract except the Disputes clause, the patent indemnity clause, and the portion of the Commercial Item Contract Terms and Conditions that specifies ``Compliance with laws unique to Government contracts'' (which applies only to contracts with entities of the Executive branch of the U.S. Government). The parties to this new contract which incorporates the terms and conditions of the Schedule contract are the individual ordering activity and the Contractor. The U.S. Government shall not be liable for the performance or nonperformance of the new contract. Disputes which cannot be resolved by the parties to the new contract may be litigated in any State or Federal court with jurisdiction over the parties, applying Federal procurement law, including statutes, regulations and case law, and, if pertinent, the Uniform Commercial Code. To the extent authorized by law, parties to this new contract are encouraged to resolve disputes through Alternative Dispute Resolution. Likewise, a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), although not a contract, is an agreement that may be entered into by the Contractor with such an entity and the Federal Government is not a party. (2) Where contract clauses refer to action by a Contracting Officer or a Contracting Officer of GSA, that shall mean the individual responsible for placing the order for the ordering activity (e.g., Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.212-4 at paragraph (f) and FSS clause I-FSS-249 B). (3) As a condition of using this contract, eligible ordering activities agree to abide by all terms and conditions of the Schedule contract, except for those deleted clauses or portions of clauses mentioned in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause. Ordering activities may include terms and conditions required by statute, ordinance, regulation, order, or as otherwise allowed by State and local government entities as a part of a statement of work (SOW) or statement of objective (SOO) to the extent that these terms and conditions do not conflict with the terms and conditions of the Schedule contract. The ordering activity and the Contractor expressly acknowledge that, in entering into an agreement for the ordering activity to purchase goods or services from the Contractor, neither the ordering activity nor the Contractor will look to, primarily or in any secondary capacity, or file any claim against the United States or any of its agencies with respect to any failure of performance by the other party. (4) The ordering activity is responsible for all payments due the Contractor under the contract formed by acceptance of the ordering activity's order, without recourse to the agency of the U.S. Government, which awarded the Schedule contract. (5) The Contractor is encouraged, but not obligated, to accept orders from such entities. The Contractor may, within 5 days of receipt of the order, decline to accept any order, for any reason. The Contractor shall fulfill orders placed by such entities, which are not declined within the 5-day period. (6) The supplies or services purchased will be used for governmental purposes only and will not be resold for personal use. Disposal of property acquired will be in accordance with the established procedures of the ordering activity for the disposal of personal property. (7) The state or local government ordering activity will be responsible for purchasing products or services to be used to facilitate recovery from a major disaster declared by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) or to facilitate recovery from terrorism or nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack. (b) If the Schedule Contractor accepts an order from an entity identified in paragraph (d) of the clause at 552.238-78, Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities)--Alternate I, the Contractor agrees to the following conditions--

The Contractor shall decline the order using the same means as those used to place the order. The Contractor shall fulfill orders placed by such entities, which are not declined within the 5-day period. (c) In accordance with clause 552.238-74, Industrial Funding Fee and Sales Reporting, the Contractor must report the quarterly dollar value of all sales under this contract.

I-FSS-599 ELECTRONIC COMMERCE--FACNET (SEP 2006)
(a) General Background. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 establishes the Federal Acquisition Computer Network (FACNET) requiring the Government to evolve its acquisition process from one driven by paperwork into an expedited process based on electronic commerce/electronic data interchange (EC/EDI). EC/EDI means more than merely automating manual processes and eliminating paper transactions. It can and will help to move business processes (e.g., procurement, finance, logistics, etc.) into a fully electronic environment and fundamentally change the way organizations operate.

Page: 40 of 77

7FCB-H2-070541-B Refresh: 14 Part II - CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS

(b) Trading Partners and Value-Added Networks (VAN's). Within the FACNET architecture, electronic documents (e.g., orders, invoices, etc.) are carried between the Federal Government's procuring office and contractors (now known as "trading partners"). These transactions are carried by commercial telecommunications companies called Value-Added Networks (VAN's). EDI can be done using commercially available hardware, software, and telecommunications. The selection of a VAN is a business decision contractors must make. There are many different VAN's which provide a variety of electronic services and different pricing strategies. If your VAN only provides communications services, you may also need a software translation package. (c) Registration Instructions. DOD will require Contractors to register as trading partners to do business with the Government. This policy can be reviewed via the INTERNET at http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/1999/b03011999_bt079-99.html. To do EDI with the Government, Contractors must register as a trading partner. Contractors will provide regular business information, banking information, and EDI capabilities to all agencies in this single registration. A central repository of all trading partners, called the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) http://www.ccr.gov/, has been developed. All Government procuring offices and other interested parties will have access to this central repository. The database is structured to identify the types of data elements which are public information and those which are confidential and not releasable. To register, contractors must provide their Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number. The DUNS number is available by calling 1(800)333-0505. It is provided and maintained free of charge and only takes a few minutes to obtain. Contractors will need to provide their Tax Identification Number (TIN). The TIN is assigned by the Internal Revenue Service by calling 1(800)829-1040. Contractors will also be required to provide information about company bank or financial institution for electronic funds transfer (EFT). Contractors may register through on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ or through their Value Added Network (VAN) using an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) ASC X12 838 transaction set, called a "Trading Partner Profile." A transaction set is a standard format for moving electronic data. VAN's will be able to assist contractors with registration. (d) Implementation Conventions. All EDI transactions must comply with the Federal Implementation Conventions (IC's). Many VAN's and software providers have already built the IC requirements into their products. If you need to see the IC's, they are available on a registry maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is accessible via the INTERNET at http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/csl-pubs.htm. IC's are available for common business documents such as Purchase Order, Price Sales Catalog, Invoice, Request for Quotes, etc. (e) Additional Information. GSA has additional information available for vendors who are interested in starting to use EC/EDI. Contact the Contracting Officer for a copy of the latest handbook. Several resources are available to vendors to assist in implementing EC/EDI; specific addresses are available in the handbook or from the Contracting Officer: (1) Electronic Commerce Resource Centers (ECRC's) are a network of U.S. Government-sponsored centers that provide EC/EDI training and support to the contractor community. They are found in over a dozen locations around the country. (2) Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC's) and Small Business Development

Page: 41 of 77

7FCB-H2-070541-B Refresh: 14 Part II - CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Centers (SBDC's) provide management assistance to small business owners. Each state has several locations. (3) Most major US cities have an EDI user group of companies who meet periodically to share information on EDI-related subjects. (f) GSA Advantage! Ž (1) GSA Advantage! Ž will use this FACNET system to receive catalogs, invoices and text messages; and to send purchase orders, application advice, and functional acknowledgments. GSA Advantage! Ž enables customers to: (i) Perform database searches across all contracts by manufacturer; manufacturer's model/part number; vendor; and generic product categories. (ii) Generate their own EDI delivery orders to contractors, generate EDI delivery orders from the Federal Supply Service to contractors, or download files to create their own delivery orders. (iii) Use the Federal IMPAC VISA. (2) GSA Advantage!Ž may be accessed via the GSA Home Page. The INTERNET address is: http://www.gsa.gov, or http://www.fss.gsa.gov.

(3) Further details on EDI, ICs, and GSA Advantage! Ž can be found in clause I-FSS-599, Electronic Commerce. (4) The Contractor is encouraged to place the GSA identifier (logo) on their web site for those supplies or services covered by this contract. The logo can link to the contractor's Federal Supply Schedule price list. The identifier URL is located at http://www.gsa.gov/logos. All resultant "web price lists" shown on the contractor's web site must be in accordance with section (b)(3)(ii) of this clause and nothing other than what was accepted /awarded by the Government may be included.

I-FSS-969 ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT--FSS MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (JAN 2002) Price adjustments include price increases and price decreases. Adjustments will be considered as follows: (a) Contractors shall submit price decreases anytime during the contract period in which they occur. Price decreases will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Price Reduction Clause. (b) There are two types of economic price adjustments (EPAs) possible under the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program for contracts not based on commercial catalogs or price lists as described below. Price adjustments may be effective on or after the first 12 months of the contract period on the following basis: (1) Adjustments based on escalation rates negotiated prior to contract award. Normally, when escalation rates are negotiated, they result in a fixed price for the term of the contract. No separate contract modification will be provided when increases are based on negotiated escalation rates. Price increases will be effective on the 12-month anniversary date of the contract effective date, subject to paragraph (f), below. (2) Adjustments based on an agreed-upon market indicator prior to award. The market indicator, as used in this clause, means the originally released public index, public survey or other public, based market indicator. The market indicator shall be the originally released index, survey or market indicator, not seasonally adjusted, published by the [to be negotiated], and made available at [to be identified]. Any price adjustment shall be based on the percentage change in the designated (i.e. indicator identification and date) market indicator from the initial award to the latest available as of the anniversary date of the contract effective date, subject to paragraph (e), below. If the market indicator is discontinued or deemed no longer available or reliable by the Government, the Government and the Contractor will mutually agree to a substitute. The contract modification reflecting the price adjustment will be effective upon approval by the Contracting Officer, subject to paragraph (g), below. The adjusted prices shall apply to orders issued to the Contractor on or after the effective date of the contract modification. (c) Nothwithstanding the two economic price adjustments discussed above, the Government recognizes

Page: 47 of 77

7FCB-H2-070541-B Refresh: 14 Part II - CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS

the potential impact of unforeseeable major changes in market conditions. For those cases where such changes do occur, the contracting officer will review requests to make adjustments, subject to the Government's examination of industry-wide market conditions and the conditions in paragraph (d) and (e), below. If adjustments are accepted, the contract will be modified accordingly. The determination of whether or not extra-ordinary circumstances exist rests with the contracting officer. The determination of an appropriate mechanism of adjustment will be subject to negotiations. (d) Conditions of Price change requests under paragraphs b(2) and c above.: (1) No more than three increases will be considered during each succeeding 12-month period of the contract. (For succeeding contract periods of less than 12 months, up to three increases will be considered subject to the other conditions of subparagraph (b)). (2) Increases are requested before the last 60 days of the contract period, including options. (3) At least 30 days elapse between requested increases. (4) In any contract period during which price increases will be considered, the aggregate of the increases during any 12-month period shall not exceed TBD percent (TBD%) of the contract unit price in effect at the end of the preceding 12-month period. The Government reserves the right to raise the ceiling when market conditions during the contract period support such a change. (e) The following material shall be submitted with request for a price increase under paragraphs b(2) and c above: (1) A copy of the index, survey or pricing indicator showing the price increase and the effective date. (2) Commercial Sales Practice format, per contract clause 52.215-21 Alternate IV, demonstrating the relationship of the Contractor's commercial pricing practice to the adjusted pricing proposed or a certification that no change has occurred in the data since completion of the initial negotiation or a subsequent submission. (3) Any other documentation requested by the Contracting Officer to support the reasonableness of the price increase. (f) The Government reserves the right to exercise one of the following options: (1) Accept the Contractor's price increases as requested when all conditions of (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this clause are satisfied; (2) Negotiate more favorable prices when the total increase requested is not supported; or, (3) Decline the price increase when the request is not supported. The Contractor may remove the item(s) from contract involved pursuant to the Cancellation Clause of this contract. (g) Effective Date of Increases: No price increase shall be effective until the Government receives the electronic file updates pursuant to GSAR 552.243-72, Modifications (Multiple Award Schedule). (h) All MAS contracts remain subject to contract clauses GSAR 552.238-75, "Price Reductions"; and 552.215-72, "Price Adjustment -- Failure to Provide Accurate Information." In the event the application of an economic price adjustment results in a price less favorable to the Government than the price relationship established during negotiation between the MAS price and the price to the designated customer, the Government will maintain the price relationship to the designated customer.

52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)
(a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals(A) Are ______ are not ______ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have ______ have not ______, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are ______ are not ______ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have ______ have not ______, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has ______ has not ______, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal Agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This certification concerns a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States and the making of a false, fictitious, or fraudulent certification may render the maker subject to prosecution under section 1001, title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealing. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

CONTRACT ACT TO CONTRACTS FOR CERTAIN SERVICES--CERTIFICATION (NOV 2007)
(a) The offeror shall check the following certification: CERTIFICATION The offeror ______ does ______ does not certify that-(1) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; (2) The contract services are furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices. An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror; (3) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and (4) The offeror uses the same compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract as the offeror uses for these employees and for equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. (b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Act-(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or (2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis. (c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision-(1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and (2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation.

Page: 72 of 77

7FCB-H2-070541-B Refresh: 14 Part V - OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS & CERTIFICATION

has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.
