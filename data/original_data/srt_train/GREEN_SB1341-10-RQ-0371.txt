       The Staffing Plan shall also include a detailed resume for the proposed personnel, to include their name, the organization name of their
       current employer, their relevant education, their relevant capabilities and experience, and their current country of citizenship.


 2) A detailed narrative that demonstrates the breadth and depth of the Offeror’s experience in performing work that is similar in scope to the
    requirements of the Statement of Work.  The Offeror shall also describe any certifications and forms of recognition from other entities with
    respect to the Offeror’s relevant experience and/or expertise.

 3) A completed Part I Past Performance Information Questionnaire (the required format begins two pages after this text) for similar
    contracts/orders for which the Offeror has performed as a prime Contractor or as a first-tier subcontractor on similarly scoped
    contracts/orders awarded to them in the past three years by governmental entities (federal, state, or local) or by nongovernmental entities.
    The Offeror shall submit Part I of the questionnaire with its quotation.




VOLUME II – BUSINESS VOLUME


The Offeror shall provide a completed SF 1449 (i.e., a ceiling cost/price) for Item Numbers 0001 through 0005 which shall also be accompanied by
a detailed breakdown that shows how those ceiling costs were derived and shall be based on the Offeror's proposal Volume II and solicitation
requirements.

As part of the detailed breakdown for the proposed ceiling cost/price, the Offeror must specify fixed hourly rates in its offer that include
wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit.  The Offeror must specify whether the fixed hourly rate for each labor
category applies to labor performed by--

    (1) The Offeror;

    (2) Subcontractors; and/or

    (3) Divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the offeror under a common control.

The Offeror must establish fixed hourly rates using--

    (1) Separate rates for each category of labor to be performed by each subcontractor and for each category of labor to be performed by the
Offeror, and for each category of labor to be transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the Offeror under a common control;

    (2) Blended rates for each category of labor to be performed by the Offeror, including labor transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or
affiliates of the offeror under a common control, and all subcontractors; or

    (3) Any combination of separate and blended rates for each category of labor to be performed by the offeror, affiliates of the offeror under
a common control, and subcontractors.

The detailed breakdown for Item Numbers 0001 through 0005 shall also delineate proposed other direct costs, including travel costs for
requirements identified in the Statement of Work and costs for materials and/or any other costs that are directly attributable to this contract
besides the Offeror’s direct labor proposed.  This delineation shall include as much detail as practicable.  The Offeror may apply any
appropriate indirect cost to any proposed other direct costs if such practice is consistent with the Offeror’s usual accounting procedures and
is permitted by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 31.

   (4) The Offeror shall submit the following as part of Volume II Cost/Price Quotation:


      Labor-hour based cost/price information for the requirements of the attached statement of work for line items 0001 through 0005, labor
    categories proposed for task orders one and two, ceiling estimate of hours per labor category, total ceiling cost per labor category, and
                                                          applicable other direct costs.

Evaluation FACTORS FOR AWARD

The Government intends to use a tradeoff process to award a single purchase order, with a period of performance of 12 months, with the option to
extend for 4 additional 12 month periods, to the contractor whose proposal for web content and development/maintenance for the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Human Resources Management Division (HRMD) represents the best value to the Government, evaluated
cost and other factors considered.


01. Evaluation Factors



The evaluation factors are (1) Technical Approach, (2) Experience, (3) Past Performance, and (4) Price.


      (1) Technical Approach:


      The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed Technical Approach for the completing the requirements of the attached statement of
      work to determine the extent to which its technical approach demonstrates its understanding of the task order requirements; the extent to
      which the proposed Staffing Plan and Work Plan demonstrate performance that will be efficient and effective and will ensure successful
      performance of the task order and any risks associated with the offeror's demonstrated technical capability to perform the requirements.



      (2) Experience

   A. Evaluation of organizational experience will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror’s general background, experience,
      and qualifications demonstrate its ability to perform of similar services.


   B. NIST will evaluate the experience of the proposed key personnel to determine the extent to which their background, education, work
      experience, and accomplishments demonstrate their ability to effectively perform the requirements of the statement of work.

      (3) Past Performance

      The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors’ past performance information to determine its
      relevance to the current requirements and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant
      contracts in the past three years.


      In assessing the offeror’s past performance, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness and ability to control cost and schedule of past
      work to determine the quality of service, and the extent to which the offeror has performed work of a similar type, magnitude and
      complexity. The Government will assign a neutral rating to offerors with no relevant past performance.

      (4) Price/Cost

      The Government will evaluate whether the proposed cost/price for the first two task orders in Section J is fair and reasonable in relation
      to the solicitation requirements and consistent with the Offeror’s Volume I - Technical Volume.   The Government may also perform cost
      realism analysis as defined in FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluated cost/price after cost realism analysis is performed will be the
      cost/price used by the Government for proposal evaluation and award purposes.


      Non-cost/price factors (1) through (3), when combined, are equal in importance to factor (4), Evaluated Cost/Price.
