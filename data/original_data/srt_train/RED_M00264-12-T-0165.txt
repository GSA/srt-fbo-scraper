USMC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION (March 2008)

To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, "ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUEST (MAR 2008)", the United States Marine Corps (USMC) utilizes Wide Area
WorkFlow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit
and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically.

The contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports under this contract/order, unless the provision
at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies.

The contractor shall:
 i) Ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov

(List as necessary)

(iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO GPA,
the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.
The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines
that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the
solicitation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared
ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(1) Listed end products.


|Listed End Product                         |Listed Countriesof Origin                                         |
|                                           |                                                                  |
|                                           |                                                                  |
|                                           |                                                                  |

period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for

(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this

This acquisition will utilize the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures.  Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional
credit will be given for exceeding acceptability.  Award will be made to the acceptable quoter with the lowest evaluated price, which is deemed
responsible in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and whose quote conforms to the Quote requirements.  The quote requirements
include all stated terms, conditions, representation and certification, and other information required by this quote.  The Government reserves
the right to award without discussions.  Therefore, each initial quote should contain the Quoter’s best terms from a price and technical
standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.

Award Decision:  The award decision will be made as follows:

   1) Step One – Determine Technical Acceptability.  The Technical Capability, Factor 1, and Past Performance, Factor 2, will assess the Quoters
      capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement.  The government will evaluate all technical capability quotes received by the required
      date/time.  The Technical Capability and Past Performance Factors will receive a rating of acceptable or unacceptable.  If any factor is
      rated “unaccceptable”, the entire proposal is rendered unacceptable.  Only proposals deemed technically acceptable (either initially or as
      the result of discussions) will be considered for award.

The technical ratings are defined below:

|Rating                                                                |Description                                                           |
|Acceptable                                                            |Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the quote.            |
|Unacceptable                                                          |Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the quote.    |

The past performance ratings are defined below:
|Rating                                                                |Description                                                           |
|Acceptable                                                            |Based on the Quoter’s performance record, the Government has a        |
|                                                                      |reasonable expectation that the Quoter will successfully perform the  |
|                                                                      |required effort, or the Quoter’s performance record is unknown (see   |
|                                                                      |Note below).                                                          |
|Unacceptable                                                          |Based on the Quoter’s performance record, the Government has no       |
|                                                                      |reasonable expectation that the Quoter will successfully perform the  |
|                                                                      |required effort.                                                      |

NOTE:  In the case of an Quoter without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so
sparse that no meaningful past perormance rating can be reasonably assigned, the Quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past
performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2) (iv)).  Therefore, the Quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  In the context of
acceptability/ unacceptability, “unknown.” Shall be considered “acceptable”.

   2) Step Two – Evaluate Price.  The Quoter’s price quote will be evaluated, for award purposes, based upon the total price proposed as
      annotated under Factor 3 – Price.


   3) Step Three – Award Decision.  Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable Quoter, subject to a positive responsibility
      determination in accordance with FAR Part 9 and conformance of the Quoter’s quote to the terms and conditions of the quote.
