RATING SCALE

Please use the following ratings to answer the questions.  If you are unable to rate an item because it was not a requirement, never an
issue, or you have no knowledge of the item in question, then you should mark “NA”.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Excellent -      The offeror’s performance was consistently superior.  The contractual
           performance was accomplished with only minor problems for which corrective
           action taken by the contractor was highly effective.

Good -                 The offeror’s performance was better than average, and you would
           willingly do business with the offeror again.  The contractual performance was
           accomplished with minor problems for which corrective actions taken by
           the contractor were effective.

Neutral -        No record exists.

Average -        The offeror’s performance was satisfactory and consideration would take part in
           awarding a contract to the offeror again.  The contractual performance reflects a
           problem for which the contractor has not yet implemented corrective actions.

Poor -                 The offeror’s performance was entirely unsatisfactory and you would not do
           business with the offeror again under any circumstances.  The contractual
           performance being assessed contains problems for which the
           contractor‘s corrective actions appear to be or were ineffective.



NOTE:       For statements indicating “Poor”, please provide a brief explanation
           in the comments section of the survey.
