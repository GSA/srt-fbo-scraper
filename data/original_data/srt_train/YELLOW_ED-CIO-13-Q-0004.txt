Attachment A Performance Work Statement ED Information Technology Investment Management and Enterprise Architecture Support February 27, 2013 1. Purpose This Performance Work Statement (PWS) describes services required by the US Department of Education heretofore referred to as "ED" or "the Department", under the Director of Information Technology Program Services (ITPS) in the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). The Department seeks contractor to support in the successful execution of its Information Technology Investment Management (ITIM) program function which consists of Investment and Acquisition Management (IAM) and Enterprise Architecture (EA). The services described in the outcomes table support the goal of providing IAM and EA support services to the U.S. Department of Education's business units and senior leadership. The services provided under this contract will provide ED with strategic business planning and investment management capabilities that support achieving the agency's goals and objectives by effectively and efficiently managing the Department's Information Management Resources. The vendor shall provide services to ensure:  The completion, regular updating, and publishing of IAM and EA policy, processes and guidance in a form that is approved, understandable, and usable by the Department  The use of the IAM and EA by the Department as an effective tool for planning  That the activities that are undertaken by IAMT and EA to achieve the Department's goals are effectively planned, tracked, and reported. 2. Introduction The Department takes an integrated approach to managing its IT portfolio with Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) and Enterprise Architecture (EA) processes and procedures that ensure IT projects are being implemented at acceptable budget and costs; within reasonable and expected time frames; and in a way that contributes to tangible, observable improvements in mission performance and program management decisions as required by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, and the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. The Department's ITIM portfolio management team consists of two offices: Investment and Acquisition Management Team (IAMT) and Enterprise Architecture Program serving under the Director of Information Technology Program Services (ITPS). The current portfolio consists of 29 major investments and approximately 143 non-major investments maintained by project managers belonging to 23 Principal Offices separated into lines-of-business segments managed by 13 Segment Owners. IT Investment Management (ITIM) is fundamental to the execution of Departmental strategy and helps to integrate processes such as Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC), Life Cycle Management (LCM), and IT governance. The integration of the budget and performance ensures linkage of funding decisions to results, and ensures that the Department complies with the mandates of the Clinger-Cohen Act and OMB. The collection of artifacts, data and analysis provides information that supports value measurement and effective IT investment decisions. 2.1 Investment and Acquisition Management Background

1

.

The Department's Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) program is under the direction of the Chief, Investment and Acquisition Management Team (IAMT.) The IAM Team works closely with EA to ensure investments follow the Department's Lifecycle Management Methodology (LCM) and participate in stage gate reviews. The Department integrates the ITIM/CPIC process with the Department's strategic planning, EA, budgeting, finance and accounting, Contracting and Acquisition Management (CAM) processes, Information Assurance (IA for IT security) program and its overall Information and Resources Management (IRM) practice. The IAM Team consists of six Federal employees supported by the awardee of this contract. The IAMT is responsible for developing and implementing policies, guidance, training, as well as the strategies and processes designed to enhance and oversee the Department's day-to-day CPIC processes, reviewing interagency agreements and statements of work related to IT investments, organizing and conducting the Agency's IT investment governance program, and supporting the line of business segment owners in the preparation, review, and maintenance of Major and Nonmajor IT investment business cases (OMB exhibits 53 A, B, C, & D and 300 A & B) for activities prior to Select, Select, Control and Evaluate phase activities associated with the investment management process. The capital planning program at the Department is comprised of the Select, Control, and Evaluate phases. The activities prior to Select and the Select Phase are conducted as part of the Department's annual budget formulation process and results in funding decision recommendations by the Planning and Investment Review Working Group (PIRWG) to the Investment Review Board (IRB). The results are reported to OMB via the Exhibit 53. The OMB Exhibit 53 is a summary of the agency's IT Investment Portfolio including budget information of both the Major and Non-Major investments. The Department's Exhibit 53 includes all Major investments including E -Gov, and Line of Business IT initiatives. A draft 53 is due near the end of August with a final due in September. Exhibit 53s may be revised due to pass back with OMB's permission. The Control Phase monitors progress of investments in meeting planned targets. The OMB Circular A-11, Part 7 requires that each agency provide a detailed capital asset plan and justification report, called an Exhibit 300 for each major IT investment. The Project Managers of these initiatives prepared Exhibit 300s for submission to OMB. Exhibits 300 are initially due with the Department's budget submission in September. They are then revised after OMB provides the Department with budget pass back information in late November or early December. Monthly reporting is updated via the Exhibit 300 throughout the fiscal year. All submissions to OMB must be done electronically. The Department uses eCPIC as their portfolio management tool. Project Managers maintain both Major and Non-Major data in eCPIC. IAMT maintains support of eCPIC and provides technical assistance to the project managers and other users of the system.

The Evaluate Phase determines if the investment met the planned projections related to cost, schedule, and performance metrics. Business case information comes from Project Managers belonging to Principal Offices separated into Lines of Business Segments managed by Segment Owners. Finally, the Evaluate Phase commences when the project is implemented into production. At this point Operational Analysis is performed to ascertain if the project has met the business need it was approved for, if the project met the approved schedule and if it adhered to the approved budget. Contractor assistance is needed for comprehensive Select, Control, and Evaluate phase planning, coordination, participation, support, and execution.

The Director of IAMT and the Chief Enterprise Architect support the Department's IT governance process by facilitating the Department's IT governance structure made up of the PIRWG and the Departmental IRB of which the Department's Chief Information Officer (CIO) and the Information Technology Program Services (ITPS) Director are active participants. IAMT supports the PIRWG, IRB and the CIO by providing complete accurate and reliable information pertaining to Education's IT Portfolio. The PIRWG continually manages oversight of the complete IT portfolio and makes funding recommendations to the CIO, who in turn has decision-making authority when preparing recommendations to the IRB. The IRB makes the final funding decision which then constitutes the Department's IT portfolio and budget strategy for the coming fiscal year. As part of continuous monitoring to insure quality data and adherence to best practices, IAM Team is also responsible for conducting detailed program reviews in the form of program assessments, Bureau-level Tech Stats, Agency-level Tech Stats, investment quality reviews, and investment health reviews. The IAMT is also responsible for developing and maintaining the OCIO IT review process used for all acquisition requests in the form of Interagency Agreements (IAA), performance work statements (PWS), statements of objectives (SOO), and statements of work (SOW) associated with information technology and solicit proper and required IT language to be included. Documents are posted, tracked, and maintained using Share Point for collaboration between reviewers and submitters and to ensure IT is recorded properly in contracts and all IT is captured for proper reporting. 2.2 Enterprise Architecture Background The Department's Enterprise Architecture (EA) Program provides the IRM strategic plan, architecture guidance, tools, and assistance required to support business modernization and transformation, informed IT investment decision making, and effective governance of agency information management resources. The Department's EA program sets the architectural policies, processes, standards and guidelines for transforming ED's business operations from paper based transactions and legacy technologies, to an integrated, digital services oriented platform based on modern technologies that supports collaboration within the Department, with its partners, customers and oversight entities. ED's EA Program provides a framework for aligning IT investments with mission needs. The EA Program is designed to significantly reduce the risks involved with the transformation efforts of the agency and plays a critical role in the modernization planning and performance improvement lifecycle for the agency. ED's EA provides the blueprint that links the agency's goals, performance measures, business segments, service components, information and data to the enterprise technology. It provides a strategy for transitioning from a baseline architecture "As -Is" to the target architecture "To-Be". ED's EA is developed in alignment with the "Common Approach to Enterprise Architecture", and describes the operations of thirteen EA segments that correspond to the ED lines of business. The EA is fundamental to the execution of Departmental strategy and helps to integrate processes such as Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC), Life Cycle Management (LCM), and IT management. This integration of the budget and performance ensures linkage of funding decisions to results and ensures that the Department's EA complies with the mandates required by the Clinger-Cohen Act and OMB. The collection of enterprise architecture artifacts, data and analysis provides information supports that value measurement and effective IT investment decisions. The
3

.

EA is also used by enterprise-wide initiatives to guide the building of enterprise-wide business and technical solutions that transition the Department to its Future State Vision. Enterprise Architecture provides an intermediate and longer-term enterprise business process and technology roadmap to guide business process changes, technology choices, IT technical and data standards, governance policies, and procedures over time. To measure the effectiveness and maturity of the ED's EA Program capabilities, the EA program requires an annual assessment of the ED EA program using the Government Accounting Office (GAO) Enterprise Architecture Maturity Framework. Both current "As-Is", and target "To-Be" architectures and various EA artifacts are designed to demonstrate compliance with OMB guidance. The ED EA is also used to identify services, business processes, information and investments that can be shared, reused or repurposed. The EA Program's main objective is ensuring that the Department's use of IT delivers value, effectively supports the delivery of program services achieve the Department's mission, goals and objectives.

2. Objective The objective of this PWS is to achieve the goals for a comprehensive, well-managed IT investment portfolio.

I. Introduction The U.S. Department of Education (Department) LCM Framework (Framework) describes the management process that is to be used by Department components engaged in the acquisition and development of information technology (IT) solutions. The Framework describes the key activities, deliverables and reviews an IT solution moves through over the course of its lifecycle. The Framework is designed to coordinate and integrate Department processes that impact IT solutions acquisition and development. II. Purpose This directive sets forth the Department's policy for using the Department's LCM Framework to provide the foundation for the implementation of standards, processes and procedures for acquiring and developing IT solutions. All LCM- related processes will use the Framework to align and streamline their processes to support effective oversight and management of IT solution acquisition and development. III. Policy This directive applies to the development, acquisition, implementation, maintenance and disposal of IT solutions regardless of cost, complexity and time constraints. IV. Authorization The following are links to Federal regulations and policies that support the Department's use of a LCM approach: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Clinger-Cohen Act); Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123 OMB Circular A-130 U.S. Department of Education Investment Review Board Charter

The Department's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) will own and maintain the Framework; communicate it to the Principal Offices; and provide support for its implementation. V. Applicability This directive applies to all Department employees and contractors engaged in the development, acquisition, implementation, maintenance and disposal of IT solutions. Nothing in this directive is meant to excuse or exempt contractors from satisfying all requirements of their contracts. VI. Definitions The following are key definitions related to this directive. A. Lifecycle Management (LCM) is the coordination of activities associated with the documentation and implementation of IT solutions from conception through disposal. Such

OCIO:1-106

Page 3 of 25 (07/16/2010)

activities include: defining requirements, designing, building, testing, implementing, establishing operations and disposing of systems. B. Framework is a structured approach of required stages, key activities and core deliverables that provides a foundation for aligning existing interrelated processes within the Department, regardless of system lifecycle methodology employed. C. Enterprise Architecture Advisory Committee (EAAC) is the Department's governance body that advises the Chief Enterprise Architect on enterprise architecture (EA) programmatic policies and issues, business/IT strategic planning support, and information and artifacts related to the creation, maintenance and use of EA within the Department. The EAAC also provides advice and recommendations regarding the Department's IT portfolio to the Planning and Investment Review Working Group (PIRWG). D. Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB) is the Department's governance body that performs technical reviews to assess (1) EA standards compliance, (2) technical design, and (3) opportunities for service and technical component standards reuse. The EARB also serves as a committee supporting the EAAC. E. Change Advisory Board (CAB) is the Department's governance body that reviews, approves and implements change requests for the EDUCATE IT Infrastructure. F. IT Solution pertains to automated information systems, software applications, and manual processes. G. Stage is a definitive section of the lifecycle that indicates a specific purpose or goal has been achieved. The end of each stage is marked by a "Stage Gate," noting the exit from one stage and entry into the next. H. Key Activity is a required task, procedure or process. I. Core Deliverable is a required document that must be completed and approved by the end of a particular stage of the lifecycle.

J. Exit /Entry Criteria refers to requirements that must be completed and approved in order to exit one stage and enter the next. K. Stage Gate Review is the integration of various business and technical reviews performed primarily by the EARB that ensures core deliverables (and any additional deliverables) required for that stage have been completed. VII. Responsibilities The following are staff responsibilities associated with this directive: A. The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for authorizing the development and implementation of an LCM Framework and IT Governance Process that ensures Department IT Solutions Development is managed in accordance with Department standards and procedures. The CIO monitors the execution of the IT Governance process, approving the decisions of the IT

OCIO:1-106

Page 4 of 25 (07/16/2010)

governance bodies, and adjudicating disputes that may arise between the IT governance bodies and Project Managers. B. Enterprise Architecture staff is responsible for developing, implementing and maintaining the LCM Framework and IT Governance process on behalf of the CIO and for reviewing IT investments for adherence to the Department's enterprise architecture current and future state vision. C. Project Managers are responsible for creating deliverables and ensuring that business and technical reviews are executed and required deliverables are completed. They are also responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the Department's IT solutions. D. Deliverable Reviewers are responsible for reviewing and approving the content of required deliverables. Deliverable Reviewers are staff from various business and technical areas (e.g. Investment Acquisition Management Team (IAMT), Contracts and Acquisition Management (CAM)) with specific knowledge of the requirement areas. E. EARB Members are responsible for authorizing a project's progress into the next LCM stage based on the completion of reviews and deliverables required by the preceding LCM stage. VIII. The Framework The Framework is a structured approach of required stages, key activities and core deliverables that provides a foundation for aligning existing interrelated processes such as, the OCIO's IT Governance and Capital Planning and Investment Control processes, OCFO's Acquisition process and processes associated with project management, used in delivering IT solutions. The purpose of the Framework is to help existing Department processes work together more efficiently. It is not intended to reengineer existing processes, but rather, to provide a foundation and frame of reference for aligning them. Staff from various processes related to LCM will be responsible for determining the particulars of how their processes will work within the Framework. In aligning processes, the Framework provides the basis for executing enforcement mechanisms already contained in those processes. Through a stage gate review, the Framework focuses on results obtained at the end of each stage to assist investment oversight, product quality and compliance to Department directives and regulations. However, these stage gate reviews do not represent an additional enforcement layer, but rather are a means to facilitate and coordinate business and technical reviews for each stage already present in existing processes. The Framework is flexible concerning core deliverable length and the addition of deliverables to accommodate solutions with varying cost, complexity and time constraints. All Framework activities and core deliverables are required for Non-Major IT projects 1 ; however, the total documentation for a very small project might amount to just one or two pages, for example. Additionally, project staff should rely on existing Department guidance documents and staff

Please refer to Investment Management Process Guide for a description of Non-Major IT. Also see ACS Directive OCIO:3108 referenced in Appendix D of this directive.

expertise relevant to small projects to determine how those projects should align and work within the Framework. By using this Framework directive, the Department will realize the following benefits: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ A single reference to inform Department employees of expectations, activities and core deliverables associated with IT solutions acquisition and development. Improved product quality and reduced rework by establishing standard business and technical reviews throughout the development of IT solutions. Improved oversight by encouraging and enabling integrated and coordinated reviews. Improved performance management of projects through review of project cost and schedule in alignment with the Department's mission or objectives. A mechanism by which projects can define their deliverables against the scope of the IT solution. Improved quality of information used in the IT investment process.

The Framework is comprised of six stages: 1) Vision; 2) Definition; 3) Construction and Validation; 4) Implementation; 5) Support and Improvement; and 6) Retirement. Each stage consists of required key activities and core deliverables that must be completed for entry into the next stage. A stage gate review is conducted by the EARB at designated points in the LCM Framework to ensure the key activities, core deliverables, and any additional deliverables required for that stage have been completed. Any deviations from this process must be approved in writing by the CIO. Appendix A is an acronym list and Appendix B, a glossary. A detailed illustration of the Framework, Departmental document references and a template for the Tailored Project Guide can be found in Appendices C-E respectively. The content of the appendices is "for information purposes only" and serves as guidance for those using this directive. Appendix C is a visual portrayal of the required stages, key activities and deliverables described in this directive. In this document, the Framework stages are designated by a number followed by supporting information for each stage. The sections in the text are numbered to correspond to the six stages of the Framework. Key activities and core deliverables for each stage are explained in text format. Supporting detail for each core deliverable within a particular stage is contained in tables. The tables support the bulleted list of core deliverables in each stage by providing detail that better explains each deliverable. Below is key information regarding each stage of the Framework. 1. VISION STAGE The purpose of the Vision Stage is to develop a business case, necessary acquisition planning documents for the procurement of services and resources to build new IT solutions or improve existing IT assets and high-level requirements for the new system. During this process, the feasibility and cost of the project will be assessed.

I.

Purpose
The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) developed this directive to establish policy and responsibilities for individuals and entities that participate in the U.S. Department of Education (ED)'s information technology (IT) investment management process. Federal statutes such as the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 require agencies to improve mission performance by implementing an IT investment management process for selecting, controlling, and evaluating IT investments. Enactment of this legislation and its accompanying regulations requires agencies to establish accountability, reduce duplicative spending, eliminate inefficiencies, and maximize the value of IT investments.

II.

Policy
It is ED's policy that all information technology investments support and are aligned with ED's business objectives and Strategic Plan, minimize duplication of investment efforts, comply with all relevant statutes, regulations, and ED policies, and are carefully selected and managed in a way that demonstrates careful decision making, with the greatest possible partnership and resource sharing. OCIO manages ED's IT investment management (ITIM) process to ensure consistency with all applicable legislation as well as ED's enterprise architecture, information management, information assurance, and related standards and processes. The ITIM process is iterative and uses a cycle of IT project selection, control, and evaluation to maximize desired business outcomes. Tools such as business cases and earned value metrics allow IT investments to be analyzed for success throughout their life cycles. Project managers submit business cases and other core deliverables to OCIO for review and clearance. OCIO collaborates with Principal Offices during the review process to ensure that each IT investment is aligned with ED's policies and standards and is driven by sound business needs and requirements as defined in an approved business case. Information technology initiatives are incorporated into ED's IT portfolio and are monitored by its Planning and Investment Review Working Group (PIRWG), Investment Review Board (IRB), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and by the public through the IT Dashboard.

III.

Authorization
Various legislative and regulatory statutes require implementation of an effective IT investment management process. The Clinger-Cohen Act, OMB Circular A-130, and other legislative reforms emphasize the need for Federal agencies to significantly improve how they plan, select, fund, control, and evaluate IT investments. The Clinger-Cohen Act establishes clear accountability for information resource management by vesting agency chief information officers with the authority and management responsibilities necessary to advise agency heads.

OCIO:3-108

Applicability
This directive applies to all ED Principal Offices and other ED entities that own, direct, maintain, or operate information technology in support of ED, and to all ED employees and contractors utilizing ED's IT equipment and software, whether connected or not to ED's Education Network (EDUCATE), with exception to specific security IT assets covered or mandated by Federal directives outside of ED (i.e., Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 and Federal Information Processing Standard 201).

V.

Definitions
A. Baseline Change Request. A request made by the project manager of an IT investment to the project's cost and schedule of milestones because one or more of three things have occurred: (1) change in scope; and/or (2) change in funding; and/or (3) change to schedule.

OCIO:3-108 B.

Page 5 of 14 (03/04/2010) Business Case. The documentation for an IT investment (see item O, below) that defines what is going to be done, why it is worth doing, how it will be accomplished, what resources will be required, and how long it will be needed. A business case allows governing bodies that review the investment, such as the PIRWG, to screen and validate it for overall business merit. A business case is required for all IT investments. Business Segment. As defined on pp. 34-48 of the ED Enterprise Architecture Overview and Guide (February 2007) (http://connected/index.cfm?navid=1617), a business segment is a further delineation into lines of business of the three primary Enterprise Architecture areas (Core Mission, Business Services, and Enterprise Services) defined by OMB's EA practice guidance. Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council. The principal interagency forum for guiding IT investment management practices in the federal sector. Control Phase. An ongoing monitoring process within the ITIM cycle that manages IT investments against schedules, budgets, and performance measures. Lessons learned from the Control Phase are incorporated into the Select Phase to further refine and improve the formulation and maintenance of ED's IT portfolio. Deliverable Reviewers. Staff from various business and technical areas (e.g. OCIO/Investment and Acquisition Management Team, OCFO/Contracts and Acquisitions Management, OM/RIMS) who are responsible for reviewing and approving the content of all required deliverables, because they have specific knowledge of the requirements areas. Earned Value Management (EVM). An IT investment management tool that measures the value of work on a project against its cost. EVM integrates cost, schedule and technical performance measures to monitor and control project resources and compare project results with original project plans. Qualities and operating characteristics of earned value management systems are described in ANSI/EIA Standard 748-1998, Earned Value Management Systems. Consult ED's IT Investment Management Process Guide to learn when to incorporate EVM in major IT development, modernization, and enhancement investments. Enterprise Architecture (EA). A framework for organizing and governing IT investments. Divided into thirteen business segments, ED's enterprise architecture allows the entire IT portfolio to be used to determine reuse opportunities and to eliminate duplication of effort. EA links ED's business needs with the best available technology and facilitates both the definition and achievement of the future state vision. It encompasses business process, application, data and technology areas. EA supports planning, designing, and implementing changes in each area. EA also provides the tools and methods that support priority setting and investment decision making about changes in these areas, as well as the templates and documentation needed to secure OMB concurrence with investment project proposals. ED's EA is documented in the form of narrative text, inventories, mappings, and models. These products are maintained and

Enterprise Architecture Review Board (EARB). The Department of Education governance body responsible for performing technical reviews to assess (1) Enterprise Architecture standards compliance, (2) technical design, and (3) opportunities for service and technical component standards reuse. Exhibit 53. A report to OMB that contains financial data for all ED IT investments. Exhibit 300. The cost, schedule, and program management document submitted to OMB by ED to substantiate each of its major information technology investments. Evaluate Phase. A review process that takes place after an IT investment is operational, to determine whether the investment meets expectations. Lessons learned are incorporated into the Select and Control Phases. Program Assessments of IT investments (see item W, below) are part of the Evaluate Phase. Information Technology. As defined by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (sections 5002, 5141, and 5142), information technology means any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the executive agency. For purposes of the preceding sentence, equipment is used by an executive agency if it is used directly or by a contractor under a contract with the agency that (i) requires the use of such equipment, or (ii) requires the use, to a significant extent, of such equipment in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product. The term information technology includes computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services), and related resources, but does not include any equipment that is acquired by a Federal contractor incidental to performance of a Federal contract. IT Dashboard. The public-facing Web site (http://it.usaspending.gov) implemented by the Office of Management and Budget to allow taxpayers to view details of Federal information technology investments and thereby foster transparency in Federal IT spending. IT Investment. An expenditure involving information technology as defined in the Clinger-Cohen Act, including all lifecycle cost categories such as equipment, software, training, and information or application system design, development, and maintenance, regardless of whether such work is performed by Government employees or contractors.

Page 7 of 14 (03/04/2010) Investment Review Board (IRB). The executive decision-making body for ED's IT investment management process. The IRB is composed of the senior officers of Principal Offices and other key personnel. It sets priorities and objectives used to assess IT initiatives and is responsible for overseeing the entire IT portfolio of ED. Membership of the IRB is described in the IRB Charter (see item III.G on page 3, above). Lifecycle Management (LCM). The coordination of activities associated with implementation of information systems from conception through disposal, which includes defining requirements, designing, building, testing, implementing, and disposing of systems. Consult the Lifecycle Management Framework directive on roles, responsibilities, and required deliverables that result from the lifecycle management process. Major IT Investment. An IT investment that meets any of the following criteria: (1) an investment with a 3-year cost greater than $3.5 million (not including FTE); (2) an OMBdesignated line-of-business or eGov initiative; (3) a financial system with a 1-year cost of $500 thousand or more (including FTE); or (4) an investment identified as major by the IRB or the Secretary of ED. Operational Analysis. A method for examining the current and historical performance of an operational (steady-state) investment and measuring that performance against an established set of cost, schedule, and performance parameters. Conducted during the Control Phase, or after an IT effort becomes operational, this activity helps to determine what, if any, changes are needed to improve investment efficiency and effectiveness. An Operational Analysis plan provides a baseline of expected performance for the investment; the Operational Analysis report determines how well the investment is performing to its plan. Planning and Investment Review Working Group (PIRWG). The ED entity that serves as the working body of the Investment Review Board, coordinating ED's IT investment management process and procedures. The PIRWG reviews all investments from an enterprise perspective and makes recommendations to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) for select, control, and evaluate decisions. Membership of the PIRWG is described in the IRB Charter (see item III.G on page 3, above). Principal Office Coordinator. The individual nominated by a Principal Office to serve as coordinator of the Office's portfolio of IT investments in dealings with the CIO, PIRWG and IRB. Program Assessment. An independent review (i.e., conducted by a non-stakeholder) of a major IT investment to determine investment performance. Improvement plans are implemented as an outcome of the assessment. Project Management. The activities necessary to ensure that an IT project progresses toward achievement of its objectives, in accordance with planned or revised cost, schedule, and technical baselines, as well as performance outcomes.

Project Manager / Program Manager. According to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) definition, a project is a unique undertaking with a beginning and an end; once the project is deployed or implemented, the project manager is replaced with a program manager. These persons may be the same individual. A project manager and a program manager must be identified for each IT investment and will be responsible and accountable to the PIRWG, and to OCIO/IAMT working on behalf of the PIRWG, for all project management activities. Credentialing requirements for managers of major projects are detailed in OMB's Federal IT Project Manager Guidance Matrix. ED requires a Federal Acquisition Certification for Program and Project Managers (FAC/P/PM) certification for project managers of major IT investments. Select Phase. One of the three phases of the IT investment management life cycle, the Select Phase is conducted yearly to determine which IT investments to approve, subject to the availability of funding. The Select Phase allows ED to link its priorities to candidate projects to be funded, ensuring that ED funds only those IT investments that best support mission needs and have been adequately analyzed for risks and returns. Stage Gate Reviewer. The individual responsible for authorizing a project's progress into the next stage of its lifecycle, based on completion of reviews and deliverables for each stage. Consult the Lifecycle Management Framework directive for information about stage gates and stage gate reviews.

Except for changes identified as such in writing and signed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall notify the Administrative Contracting Officer in writing promptly, within ten(10) calendar days from the date that the Contractor identifies any Government conduct (including actions, inactions, and written or oral communications) that the Contractor regards as a change to the contract terms and conditions. On the basis of the most accurate information available to the Contractor, the notice shall state-(1) The date, nature, and circumstances of the conduct regarded as a change;

(c) "Continued performance." Following submission of the notice required by paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor shall diligently continue performance of this contract to the maximum extent possible in accordance with its terms and conditions as construed by the Contractor, unless the notice reports a direction of the Contracting Officer or a communication from a SAR of the Contracting Officer, in either of which events the Contractor shall continue performance; provided, however, that if the Contractor regards the direction or communication as a change as described in paragraph (b) of this clause, notice shall be given in the manner provided. All directions, communications, interpretations, orders and similar actions of the SAR shall be reduced to writing promptly and copies furnished to the Contractor and to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer shall promptly countermand any action which exceeds the authority of the SAR. (d) "Government response." The Contracting Officer shall promptly, within ten(10) calendar days after receipt of notice, respond to the notice in writing. In responding, the Contracting Officer shall either-(1) Confirm that the conduct of which the Contractor gave notice constitutes a change and when necessary direct the mode of further performance; (2) Countermand any communication regarded as a change; (3) Deny that the conduct of which the Contractor gave notice constitutes a change and when necessary direct the mode of further performance; or (4) In the event the Contractor`s notice information is inadequate to make a decision under paragraphs (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this clause, advise the Contractor what additional information is required, and establish the date by which it should be furnished and the date thereafter by which the Government will respond. (e) "Equitable adjustments." (1) If the Contracting Officer confirms that Government conduct effected a change as alleged by the Contractor, and the conduct causes an increase or decrease in the Contractor`s cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether changed or not changed by such conduct, an equitable adjustment shall be made-(i) In the contract price or delivery schedule or both; and (ii) In such other provisions of the contract as may be affected. (2) The contract shall be modified in writing accordingly. In the case of drawings, designs or specifications which are defective and for which the Government is responsible, the equitable adjustment shall include the cost and time extension for delay reasonably incurred by the Contractor in attempting to comply with the defective drawings, designs or specifications before the Contractor identified, or reasonably should have identified, such defect. When the cost of property made obsolete or excess as a result of a change confirmed by the Contracting Officer under this clause is included in the equitable adjustment, the Contracting Officer shall have the right to prescribe the manner of disposition of the property. The equitable adjustment shall not include increased costs or time extensions for delay resulting from the Contractor`s failure to provide notice or to continue performance as provided, respectively, in (b) and (c) of this clause.

SECTION K REPRESENTATIONS, CERTIFICATIONS AND OTHER STATEMENTS OF OFFERORS
K. 1 52.203-11 CERTIFICATION AND DISCLOSURE REGARDING PAYMENTS TO INFLUENCE CERTAIN FEDERAL TRANSACTIONS (SEP 2007) (Reference 52.203-11) K. 2 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have /_/ have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are /_/ are not /_/ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision. (D) Have /_/, have not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has /_/ has not /_/, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
PAGE 25 OF 44 ED-CIO-13-Q-0004

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror`s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) |_| Are, |_| are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) |_| Have, |_| have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) |_| Are, |_| are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) |_| Have, |_| have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (1) Listed end products. Listed End Product Country of Origin

The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate
PAGE 31 OF 44 ED-CIO-13-Q-0004

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror |_| does |_| does not certify that-(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror |_| does |_| does not certify that-K. 4 52.233-2 SERVICE OF PROTEST (SEP 2006)

(End of Provision) K. 5 3452.209-70 CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION (MAY 2011)

(a) (1) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, by signing the form in this clause, certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances that could give rise to an organizational or personal conflict of interest, (see FAR Subpart 9.5 for organizational conflicts of interest) (or apparent conflict of interest), for the organization or any of its staff, and that the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has disclosed all such relevant information if such a conflict of interest appears to exist to a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts (or if such a person would question the impartiality of the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant). Conflicts may arise in the following situations: (i) Unequal access to information. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has access to non-public information through its performance on a government contract. (ii) Biased ground rules. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant has worked, in one government contract, or program, on the basic structure or ground rules of another government contract. (iii) Impaired objectivity. A potential contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant, or member of their immediate family (spouse, parent, or child) has financial or other interests that would impair, or give the appearance of impairing, impartial judgment in the evaluation of government programs, in offering advice or recommendations to the government, or in providing technical assistance or other services to recipients of Federal funds as part of its contractual responsibility. "Impaired objectivity" includes but is not limited to the following situations
PAGE 32 OF 44 ED-CIO-13-Q-0004

that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question a person`s objectivity: (A) Financial interests or reasonably foreseeable financial interests in or in connection with products, property, or services that may be purchased by an educational agency, a person, organization, or institution in the course of implementing any program administered by the Department; (B) Significant connections to teaching methodologies or approaches that might require or encourage the use of specific products, property, or services; or (C) Significant identification with pedagogical or philosophical viewpoints that might require or encourage the use of a specific curriculum, specific products, property, or services. (2) Offerors must provide the disclosure described above on any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) regardless of their opinion that such a conflict or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) would not impair their objectivity. (3) In a case in which an actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest) is disclosed, the Department will take appropriate actions to eliminate or address the actual or potential conflict, including but not limited to mitigating or neutralizing the conflict, when appropriate, through such means as ensuring a balance of views, disclosure with the appropriate disclaimers, or by restricting or modifying the work to be performed to avoid or reduce the conflict. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. (b) The contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees that if "impaired objectivity", or an actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest) is discovered after the award is made, it will make a full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions that the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict (or apparent conflict of interest). (c) Remedies. The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If the contractor was aware of a potential conflict of interest prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the contracting officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. These remedies include imprisonment for up to five years for violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and fines of up to $5000 for violation of 31 U.S.C. 3802. Further remedies include suspension or debarment from contracting with the Federal government. The contractor may also be required to reimburse the Department for costs the Department incurs arising from activities related to conflicts of interest. An example of such costs would be those incurred in processing Freedom of Information Act requests related to a conflict of interest. (d) In cases where remedies short of termination have been applied, the contractor, subcontractor, employee, or consultant agrees to eliminate the organizational conflict of interest, or mitigate it to the satisfaction of the contracting officer. (e) The contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement hereunder, provisions that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including specific mention of potential remedies and this paragraph (e). (f) Conflict of Interest Certification. The offeror, ____________________, hereby certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, there are no present or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be performed under the contract or task order resulting from Request for Proposal No. __________ that would create any actual or potential conflict of interest (or apparent conflicts of interest) (including conflicts of interest for immediate family members: spouses, parents, children) that would impinge on its ability to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice or result in it being given an unfair competitive advantage. In this clause, the term "potential conflict" means reasonably foreseeable conflict of interest. The offeror further certifies that it has and will continue to exercise due diligence in identifying and removing or mitigating, to the Government`s satisfaction, such conflict of interest (or apparent conflict of interest).
