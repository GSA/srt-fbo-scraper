QASP
QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)

1.  PURPOSE:
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) provides a systematic method to evaluate performance for the stated  non-personal services
contract.  This QASP explains the following:
    • What will be monitored?
    • How monitoring will take place.
    • Who will conduct the monitoring?
    • How monitoring efforts and results will be documented.


This QASP does not detail how the contractor accomplishes the work.  Rather, the QASP is created with the premise that the contractor is
responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  It is the Government’s responsibility to be
objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating performance.  In addition, the QASP should recognize that unforeseen and uncontrollable situations
may occur.

This QASP is a “living document” and the Government may review and revise it on a regular basis.  However, the Government shall coordinate
changes with the contractor.  Updates shall ensure that the QASP remains a valid, useful, and enforceable document.  Copies of the original QASP
and revisions shall be provided to the contractor and Government officials implementing surveillance activities.

      a.   QASP RELATION TO THE SOLICITATION:


            QASPs shall be developed and appear in every solicitation, as well as the resultant service contract.  The Government will retain the
      right to change the surveillance methods and Quality Assurance (QA) procedures, or to increase or decrease the degree of surveillance
      efforts at any time necessary to assure contract compliance

            b.  REVISIONS TO THE QASP:

            The QASP is a tool for use in Government administration of the Performance Work Statement/Statement of Work (PWS/SOW) and remains
      subject to revision at any time by the Government throughout the contract performance period. Revisions to this surveillance plan are the
      responsibility of the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  Changes to the QASP shall be made bilaterally.

            The contractor will assume responsibility for all tasks and deliverables in the PWS under this award. As the performance period
      progresses, the levels of surveillance may be altered for service areas in cases where performance is either consistently excellent or
      consistently unsatisfactory.  If observations reveal consistently good performance, then the amount of surveillance may be reduced.  If
      observations reveal consistent deficiencies, increased surveillance may be implemented.

2. Government Roles and Responsibilities:
The following personnel shall oversee and coordinate surveillance activities.

      a. Contracting Officer (KO) - The KO shall ensure performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensure compliance with
      the contract terms, and shall safeguard the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship.  The KO shall also assure that
      the contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under this contract. The KO is ultimately responsible for the final
      determination of the adequacy of the contractor’s performance.

      b. Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) – The COR will be located at USAARL, Fort Rucker, AL. The COR will be responsible for
      technical administration of the contract, and shall assure proper Government surveillance of the contractor’s performance.  The COR shall
      keep a quality assurance file.  At the conclusion of the contract or when requested by the KO, the COR shall provide documentation to the
      KO.  A COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government’s behalf.  The
      contractor shall refer any changes they deem may affect contract price, terms, or conditions to the KO for action.

3. Contractor Roles and responsibilities:
      The contractor is responsible for delivering services in accordance with the Contract.  The contractor shall appoint a single off-site
      point-of-contact to act as a central recipient of communication from the Government.

4. Contract Quality Requirements:
      a.   Contract quality requirements are the technical requirements in the contract relating to the quality of the service and those contract
      clauses prescribing inspection, and other quality controls incumbent on the contractor, to assure that the service conforms to the
      contractual requirements.  Government contract quality assurance shall be performed at such times and places as may be necessary to
      determine that the services conform to the contract requirements.  Failure to meet or exceed the contract quality requirements is defined
      as a “nonconformance” on the part of the contractor.  The contractor shall be held responsible for any identified nonconformance, and the
      government may require the work to be re-performed.


      b.   The Government’s contract quality assurance is defined as follows:


           1.  “Acceptance” means the act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the Government, for itself or as agent of
           another, assumes ownership of existing identified supplies tendered or approves specific services rendered as partial or complete
           performance of the contract.
           2.  “Conditional acceptance” means acceptance of supplies or services that do not conform to contract quality requirements, or are
           otherwise incomplete, that the contractor is required to correct or otherwise complete by a specified date.
           3.  “Minor nonconformance” means a nonconformance that is not likely to materially reduce the usability of the supplies or services
           for their intended purpose, or is a departure from established standards having little bearing on the effective use or operation of
           the supplies or services.
           4.  “Major nonconformance” means a nonconformance, other than critical, that is likely to result in failure of the supplies or
           services, or to materially reduce the usability of the supplies or services for their intended purpose.
           5. “Critical nonconformance” means a nonconformance that is likely to result in hazardous or unsafe conditions for individuals using,
           maintaining, or depending upon the supplies or services; or is likely to prevent performance of a vital agency mission.


      c.   Documentation:

           1.  Thorough documentation of unperformed or nonconformance is essential for tracking contractor performance throughout the period of
           performance.  The COR will document deficient work by compiling facts describing the inspection methods and results.   The COR will
           develop documentation to substantiate nonconformance with the Contract.


           2.   Remedial Action by the Contracting Officer:


                  (i)  Shall notify the contractor in writing of the nonconforming service;


                 (ii)  Shall request that the contractor perform the service, at no cost to the Government; and

                 (iii)  May accept consideration if offered.  For guidance on solicitation of a refund, see Subpart 242.71.  In accordance with
                 FAR 52.246-4: Inspection of Services-Fixed-Price, the Government may require the contractor to re-perform any services that do
                 not conform to contract requirements.  If the defects cannot be corrected by re-performance, the KO may either require the
                 contractor to take the necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to the requirements, or the KO may reduce the
                 Contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.  At an extreme decision point, penalties may include a
                 decision not to exercise contract options.  The KO will determine the penalty for nonconformance based upon his or her judgment
                 and the severity of the nonconformance.


5.  Methods of Quality Assurance Surveillance:

Various methods exist to monitor performance.  The COR shall use the surveillance methods listed below in the administration of this QASP.

Regardless of the surveillance method, the COR shall always contact the contractor's point of contact inform the manager of the specifics of the
problem.  The COR shall be responsible for monitoring the contractor’s performance in meeting the contract’s quality requirements.

      • DIRECT OBSERVATION:  (Can be performed periodically or through 100% surveillance.)
      • MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS:  (Evaluates outputs through the use of management information reports.  Best used for general
        surveillance and may need to be supplemented by periodic inspections.)
      • PERIODIC INSPECTION:  Uses a comprehensive evaluation of selected outputs.  Inspections may be scheduled as required.
            o Analysis of contractor's progress reports.  (Evaluate cost, schedule, etc.)
            o Performance reporting.

Surveillance results may be used as the basis for actions (to include payment deductions) against the contractor.  In such cases, the Inspection
of Services clause in the Contract becomes the basis for the KO’s actions.

6. Frequency of Measurement:   During contract performance, the COR shall periodically analyze whether the frequency of measurement is
appropriate for the work being performed.

this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum,

(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;

(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;

(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation.

(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items
and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and

(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and
provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions
of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.

(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for
receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.

(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of
offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the
sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.

(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for
satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.

(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:

(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office
designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is
4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.

(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the
exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting
Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--

(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to
the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or

(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under
the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.

(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at
any time it is received and may be accepted.

(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the
offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.

(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office
designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the
same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to
oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at
any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.
An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the
identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions
with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However,
the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may
reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.

(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government
reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror
specifies otherwise in the offer.

(End of provision)



52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

   Non-price evaluation factors
      Personnel Qualifications
      Past Performance
      Technical and Management Approach

   Price Factor
      Price

The Government may elect to award to other than the lowest price, based on the evaluation of the non-price factors and the best value to the
Government.  As individual factors, Personnel Qualifications is the most important of the factors and then Past Performance and last is
Technical and Management Approach.  Price is the least important of all the factors.  When considered, Personnel Qualifications is more
important than Past Performance and Technical and Management Approach combined; and Past Performance and Technical and Management Approach are
significantly more important than Price.  If two or more proposals are evaluated as relatively equal in technical merit (non-price factors),
Price could become the deciding factor in awardee selection.
Personnel Qualifications:
Each proposing offeror will be evaluated based on whether they have the skills deemed by the Government to be necessary to minimize risk and
successfully complete the requirements in the PWS.  Resumes must indicate how personnel will be able to perform the PWS.  Resumes should be no
longer than 2 pages.

Past Performance:
Provide at least 3 references for projects of similar scope and nature of work.  Describe work accomplished in similar projects indicating the
relevant quantitative and qualitative aspects of the offeror’s record of performing services similar in size, content, and complexity. Include
points of contact, their telephone numbers, and titles.  Each reference shall include a contracting and technical point of contact. To be
considered technically acceptable the offeror must demonstrate successful past performance on at least three contracts of similar type and
magnitude within the past three years.  The Government may supplement the information you provide with any other information it may obtain from
other any other source, including its own experience with your firm, or information concerning your performance from other reliable sources.

Technical and Management Approach:
Offerors shall present the technical methodology they would use in performing this project.  The technical approach will be evaluated on its
feasibility, practicability, and appropriateness in accomplishing PWS requirements. This factor indicates the merit or excellence of the
Offeror’s proposed approach to performing the work and all other requirements identified in the solicitation.

ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
