STATEMENT OF WORK

(11-02-2010)



Mainframe Software Support



INTRODUCTION



This Statement of Work (SOW) is for professional Information Technology (IT) services to provide mainframe software support services for SSA’s National Computing Center (NCC), Second Support Center (SSC), and National Support Center (NSC).



BACKGROUND



The Social Security Administration (SSA) currently operates eight IBM zSeries mainframes at the National Computer Center (NCC) and at the Second Support Center (SSC) including zSeries Application Assistant Processors (zAAP) and zSeries Integrated Information Processor (zIIP) engines, and in the future, consideration of the National Support Center (NSC).  The Agency runs hundreds of mainframe software products from multiple vendors on approximately 35 LPARS.  Since 2007, the Agency has pursued a comprehensive program that has allowed the Agency to manage better mainframe software business decisions in support of the overall mission of the SSA.  



The program has provided the Agency with specific information to improve best practices and allow SSA to better manage the life cycle of mainframe software assets.  The results of the program have allowed the Agency to cut costs, reduce liability exposure, improve mainframe software compliance and better match mainframe software use with contract terms.  The program is helping the Agency to mature as an organization in capturing and integrating physical, financial, and contractual data that supports the functions needed to manage mainframe software assets effectively and optimize SSA’s performance.



Of vital importance to the program has been the assistance of independent outside Contractors with expert knowledge of best practices in mainframe software asset management.  The Agency continues to have a requirement for services from a Contractor that is independent from the software products running on its mainframe environment to continue software pricing model assessments and assist in determining the best licensing structures for software products.



OBJECTIVE



The Agency will continue to evaluate the economic feasibility of changing some software licensing structures to zSeries New Application License Charges (zNALC), workload license charges (WLC), sub-capacity pricing, or other software pricing models where it is in the best interest of the Government.  

The Agency has specifically targeted IBM software because it presented the clearest advantage in terms of implementation in terms of overall saving.  The outcome of these consulting efforts shall allow SSA to leverage new knowledge of software pricing models that allow for additional savings to the Government.

SCOPE

 

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish a comprehensive set of professional IT support services to support SSA in maturing a strategic path to recognizing software cost savings to SSA; and to help SSA staff  to make more effective business decisions relating to software licensing activities in the Agency’s mainframe environment.  



The Agency requires services from a Contractor that is independent from the software products running on its mainframe environment to continue software pricing model assessments and assist in determining the best licensing structures for software products.  The Contractor shall possess and expert understanding of IBM’s zSeries mainframes and software, Logical Partition (LPAR) configuration, alternative workload structures and current software pricing alternatives. 



Contractor support will specifically involve: 



Market Survey, Information and Recommendations 



Sub capacity reporting tool (SCRT) activities 



Alternative-Pricing Structures 



Analysis of Software 



Monthly Assessment status reports.

All training materials provided to SSA must be in an accessible format.  In addition, training materials on the use of the accessibility features of a product or service shall be provided.



1.7  

Installation, Configuration & Integration Services

If the contractor provides installation, configuration and integration services for commercial EIT solutions or EIT solutions previously developed for other government entities, the contractor shall not install, configure or integrate the EIT solution in a way that reduces the existing EIT solution’s level of conformance with SSA’s accessibility requirements at the time the contract is awarded.



1.8  

Maintenance & Replacements

Any updates or replacements to EIT products provided to SSA pursuant to this contract shall be fully accessible with all applicable SSA’s accessibility requirements as described above.  At a minimum, any updates or replacements to any IT deliverables shall not result in a decrease in accessibility from the EIT solution being maintained or replaced.







1.9  

Labor Hours

If the anticipated labor hour deliverable is expected to involve tasks that relate to or require the use of E&IT, delivered labor hours shall include knowledge and capabilities necessary to conform to SSA’s Accessibility Requirements.



1.10  

Equivalent Facilitation

When a deliverable does not directly conform to the SSA Accessibility Requirements, but provides substantially equivalent or greater access by meeting the functional performance criteria in Subpart C of the Section 508 Standards, per Section 1194.31, then it is said to have provided Equivalent Facilitation.  

Any approach providing Equivalent Facilitation that serves as a replacement to the Assistive Technologies SSA employs (e.g. an external speech engine) shall NOT be considered as an acceptable approach to Equivalent Facilitation.  For any approach meeting Section 508 Standards using Equivalent Facilitation, the contractor shall be held accountable for maintaining and updating the approach.

B.    GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO QUOTER

      INTRODUCTION

      The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and contents of the quotation/proposal.
      Special attention is directed to the requirements for the technical and business proposals to be submitted in accordance with these
      instructions.

            1.   INSTRUCTIONS TO QUOTER


                 (1)   Restriction on disclosure and use of data.  The quotation/proposal submitted in response to this request may contain data
                 (trade secrets; business data, e.g., commercial information, financial information, and cost and pricing data; and technical
                 data) which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than
                 for evaluation of the quotation/proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government
                 determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the
                 offeror marks the cover sheet of the quotation/proposal with the following legend, specifying the particular portions of the
                 quotation/proposal which are to be restricted in accordance with the conditions of the legend. The Government's determination to
                 withhold or disclose a record will be based upon the particular circumstances involving the record in question and whether the
                 record may be exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The legend reads:

                             Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined
                            by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Social Security Administration, data contained in the portions of
                            this quotation/proposal which have been specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. by the offeror as
                            containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes.

                             The offeror acknowledges that the Agency may not be able to withhold a record (data, document, etc.) nor deny access
                            to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the Agency's FOI officials must make that determination. The
                            offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if the Agency has determined that disclosure
                            is required by the Act.

                             If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this
                            quotation/proposal, the Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the
                            contract. Quotations/Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act.

                             The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or
                            disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act. The
                            data subject to this restriction are contained in pages (insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other
                            identification).


                 (2)   In addition, the offeror should mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following statement:

                             “Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal
                            or quotation.”

                 (3)   The offeror is cautioned that a quotation/proposal submitted with restrictive legends or statements differing in
                       substance from the above legend may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal
                       submitted with a nonconforming legend.

                 4)    Purchase Order Award. The Government intends to award a  purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the
                    responsible    quoter(s) whose quotation(s) represents the best value after       evaluation in accordance with the factors
                    and subfactors in the     solicitation.


                      a. The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the Government’s interest.


                      b. The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received.

                      c. The Government shall evaluate quotations and may award a purchase order without discussions with quoters (except
                         clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a). Therefore, the quoter’s initial quotation should contain the quoter’s
                         best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if
                         the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.






        2. POTENTIAL AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS


            The Government reserves the right to award a purchase order without discussions     if the Contracting Officer determines that the
      initial prices are fair and reasonable  and that discussions are not necessary.

           The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government
           gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The
           preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.


           If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.


           The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 years.

           limiting access to only authorized contractor personnel.


           Contractor shall disclose other business relationships that may be considered to present a conflict of interest.  The COTR will
           decide if the relationship necessitates a change in the work assignment.

           adjudicated a background investigation.  The COTR will inform the contractor of the location and time to obtain a credential.


           This clause must be included in all subcontracts awarded by the contractor wherein subcontractor employees will have access to a
           facility, site, system, or information.

           In addition to the forms above, every employee who will have access to a facility, site, system, or information must complete and
           submit ONE of the following forms:

                  • Standard Form (SF) 85 for risk level 1 (Public Trust, Low Risk/Non-Sensitive), http://www.opm.gov/forms/html/sf.asp

           The risk designation associated with the work that the particular individual will be performing will determine which form the
           individual must complete.  For this contract, the following risk designation(s) apply:




           Labor Category                                                          Risk Designation
                  TDB                                               1C, Low Risk


           f. Forms Completion 
           The contractor must ensure that all forms are fully completed and signed prior to submission to SSA. 


           The contractor must ensure that the fingerprint charts and all forms are printed legibly or typed in black ink and all signatures are
           in black ink.  The contractor must also ensure there are no “breaks” in residences or employment.  SSA requires complete addresses,
           including zip codes and phone numbers.


           g. Forms Submission
           The contractor shall submit a cover sheet, including the contract number, name, and social security number of all contract employees
           for whom they are requesting a suitability determination, along with completed forms and one FD-258 fingerprint chart to:


           SSA
           CPSPM Security and Suitability Team
           6401 Security Boulevard
           Room 1260 Dunleavy Building
           Baltimore, MD  21235


           Simultaneously, the contractor must submit a copy of the cover sheet to the COTR.


           The contractor must submit these forms at least 15 days prior to the date work is to begin.
           For new contract employees who will need access to an SSA facility, site, information, or system, the contractor must submit these
           forms at least 15 days prior to beginning work under the contract.


           h. Preliminary Suitability Determination
           A Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint check will be used as part of the basis for making a preliminary suitability
           determination.  If SSA makes a favorable preliminary suitability determination, the individual may perform under the contract pending
           SSA’s final suitability determination.  CPSPM will notify contractors, with carbon copy (cc) notifications sent to both the COTR and
           CO, of the results of these determinations.


           SSA requires each contractor employee who will have access to a facility, site, system, or information to present two forms of
           identification after the contractor employee receives notification of a preliminary suitability determination but prior to beginning
           work under the contract.  In order for SSA to continue the background investigation process and enroll the contractor employee in the
           PIV credentialing process, at least one of the forms of identification must be a Government-issued photo ID (please see Employment
           Eligibility Verification, I-9, for acceptable forms of ID).


           i. Final Suitability Determination
           Final suitability determinations are made in approximately 45-90 business days after submittal of the completed forms to CPSPM.  If
           CPSPM determines that any employee is unsuitable, the COTR, CO, and contractor will be notified and SSA will revoke the employee’s
           physical and logical access.  The contractor must confirm receipt of the revocation within one business day.


           A contractor is not entitled to an equitable adjustment of the contract as a result of SSA making an unfavorable suitability
           determination on contractor employees.  Additionally, if SSA determines that the number or percentage of unfavorable determinations
           make successful contract performance unlikely, SSA may terminate the contract for cause or default.

           j. Exceptions
           The COTR may request an exception to the normal background investigation process for emergency situations when access to a facility
           or site is needed, but where access to information systems or programmatic information is not required.  This request must be
           directed to CPSPM.  COTRs may request an exception by sending an email to dchr.ope.hspd12appeals@ssa.gov.  If CPSPM grants temporary
           access, that temporary access will apply only for the period specified by CPSPM and only for the specific contract employee(s)
           identified by the COTR.  CPSPM expects that it will rarely grant exceptions.

           k. Contractor Notification to Government
           The contractor shall notify the COTR (who will notify CPSPM and the CO) within one business day if an employee is arrested or charged
           with a crime during the term of this contract, or if there is any other change in the employee’s status (e.g., the employee leaves
           the company; the employee no longer works under the contract; the employee’s alien status changes) that could impact the suitability
           determination for that individual.  The contractor must provide in that notification as much detail as possible, including, but not
           limited to:  employee name(s), contract number, the type of charge(s), if applicable, the court date, and, if available, the
           disposition of the charge(s).

           l. Government Control
           The Government has full control over and may grant, deny, or withhold access to a facility, site, system, or information and may
           require the COTR and contractor to remove personnel from performing under the contract for reasons related to conduct even after the
           individual has been found suitable to work on the contract (see paragraph n., below).

           m. Appeals Process for Unsuitable Determinations
           The contractor must notify the employee of any unsuitable determinations as soon as possible after receipt of such a determination. 
           If the employee would like clarification or wish to appeal an unsuitable determination, his/her request must be in writing and
           submitted within 30 days of the date of the unsuitable determination.  The request can be emailed to SSA at
           dchr.ope.hspd 12 appeals@ssa.gov, or mailed to:

            Social Security Administration
           Attn:  CPSPM Suitability Program Officer
           6401 Security Boulevard
           Room 1260 Dunleavy Building
           Baltimore, MD  21235


           n. Removal From Duty

           SSA may request that the contractor immediately remove any contractor employee(s) from working under the contract based on conduct
           that occurs after a pre-screening approval or favorable suitability determination.  The contractor must comply with these requests.
           The Government's determination may be made based on, but not limited to, incidents involving the misconduct or delinquency as set
           forth below:

            i. Violation of the Rules and Regulations Governing Public Buildings and Grounds, 41 Code of Federal Regulations 101-20.3.  This
               includes any local badging requirements.

           ii. Neglect of duty, including sleeping while on duty, unreasonable delays or failure to carry out assigned tasks; conducting
               personal affairs while on duty; and refusing to cooperate in upholding the integrity of SSA's security program.

          iii. Falsification or unlawful concealment, removal, mutilation, or destruction of any official documents or records, or concealment
               of material facts by willful omissions from official documents or records.

           iv. Disorderly conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, quarreling, intimidation by words or actions, or fighting.  Also,
               participating in disruptive activities, which interfere with the normal and efficient operations of the Government.

            v. Theft, vandalism, or any other criminal actions.

           vi. Selling, consuming, possession of, or being under the influence of intoxicants, drugs, or substances which produce similar
               effects.

          vii. Improper use of official authority or credentials.

         viii. Unauthorized use of communications equipment or Government property.

               are considered the same as Federal employees for the purposes of applying certain provisions of:

               The Privacy Act of 1974;


               The Tax Reform Act of 1976 and the Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act of 1997;


               SSA regulation 1;


               The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986; and


               Section 1106 of the Social Security Act.

      12.   FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT (FISMA) AND AGENCY PRIVACY MANAGEMENT (OCT 2008)


           1.    Definitions

           The following terms are defined for the purposes of this clause:

           “Agency” means the Social Security Administration (SSA).

           “OAG” means the Office of Acquisition and Grants at SSA.

           2. Agency Responsibility related to FISMA Training Requirements

           The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) (Title III, Pub. L. No. 107-347) and the Office of Management and
           Budget (OMB) policy (through Circular A-130, Appendix III) require that all Agency employees, as well as contractor and subcontractor
           employees working under Agency service contacts, receive periodic training in computer security awareness and accepted computer
           security practice of all employees, including contractors.  This includes training for contractor personnel who do not have access to
           electronic information systems. The training level is tailored to the risk and magnitude of harm related to the required activities.



           SSA’s Security Awareness bulletin adequately covers the required IT security and privacy awareness training for this contract.  The
           bulletin is located on OAG’s internet site (see information in Paragraph 3 below).
           This training does not preclude any additional training specified elsewhere in this contract.

           3. Contractor Responsibilities related to FISMA Training Requirements

                 a. Following contract award, the contractor shall ensure that all contractor employees performing under this contract have
                    signed the security bulletin entitled “SSA Security Awareness: Contractor Personnel Security Certification.”  This
                    requirement also applies to contractor employees added to the contract after contract performance has commenced.  A copy of
                    this form is located on OAG's Internet website.
                 b. The contractor must receive signed copies of the bulletin from each employee working under the contract within 45 days
                    following contract award, or within 45 days after a contractor employee begins working under the contract.
                 c. The contractor shall send an email to security.awareness.training@ssa.gov, with a copy to the contracting officer, within 60
                    days following contract award and anytime a new contractor employee is added to perform work under the contract.  The
                    contractor will include in the email the number of employees who have signed the security awareness bulletin.
                 d. The contractor shall retain copies of these signed bulletins for potential future SSA audits for a period of three years
                    after final payment (per FAR 4.703).
                 e. For each successive year the contract is in operation, the contractor shall repeat the processes described in items 3. a. –

           anniversary of the contract award date.

           4. Applicability of this Clause to contractor/subcontractor employees

           The contractor is required to include a clause substantially the same as this in all subcontracts awarded for technical or support
           services under the prime contract.  This clause shall require the subcontractors to report the information listed in Paragraph 3 of
           this clause to the contractor and the contractor will be responsible for reporting all applicable numbers to SSA.  The subcontractor
           shall be responsible for maintaining its signed forms as detailed in Paragraph 3.d.


      13.   PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION


           (a)  Confidential information, as used in this clause, means information or data, or copies or extracts of information or data, that
           is:  (1) provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to the contractor for, or otherwise obtained by the contractor in, the
           performance of this contract; and (2) of a personal nature about an individual, such as name, home address, and social security
           number, or proprietary information or data submitted by or pertaining to an institution or organization, such as employee pay scales
           and indirect cost rates.

           (b)  The Contracting Officer and the Contractor may, by mutual consent, identify elsewhere in this contract specific information or
           categories of information that the Government will furnish to the Contractor or that the Contractor is expected to generate which are
           confidential.  Similarly, the Contracting Officer and the Contractor may, by mutual consent, identify such confidential information
           from time to time during the performance of the contract.
           The confidential information will be used only for purposes delineated in the contract; any other use of the confidential information
           will require the Contracting Officer’s express written authorization.  The Contracting Officer and the Contractor will settle any
           disagreements regarding the identification pursuant to the "Disputes" clause.

           (c)  The Contractor shall restrict access to all confidential information to the minimum number of employees and officials who need
           it to perform the contract.  Employees and officials who need access to confidential information for performance of the contract will
           be determined in conference between SSA's Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative, and the responsible
           Contractor official.  Upon request, the Contractor will provide SSA with a list of “authorized personnel,” that is, all persons who
           have or will have access to confidential information covered by this clause.

           (d)  The Contractor shall process all confidential information under the immediate supervision and control of authorized personnel in
           a manner that will:  protect the confidentiality of the records; prevent the unauthorized use of confidential information; and
           prevent access to the records by unauthorized persons.

           (e)  The Contractor shall inform all authorized personnel with access to confidential information of the confidential nature of the
           information and the administrative, technical and physical safeguards required to protect the information from improper disclosure.
           All confidential information shall, at all times, be stored in an area that is physically safe from unauthorized access.  See
           paragraph (f) below regarding the minimum standards which the safeguards must meet.

           (f)   Whenever the Contractor is storing, viewing, transmitting, or otherwise handling confidential information, the Contractor shall
           comply with the applicable standards for security controls that are established in the Federal Information Security and Management
           Act (FISMA).  (These standards include those set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) via the Federal
           Information Processing Standards (FIPS) publications and NIST Special Publications, particularly FIPS 199, FIPS 200, and NIST Special
           Publications - 800 series.)




           (g)  If the Contractor, in the performance of the contract, uses any information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
           and/or section 1106 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1306, the Contractor must follow the rules and procedures governing proper
           use and disclosure set forth in the Privacy Act, section 1106 of the Social Security Act, and the Commissioner's regulations at 20
           C.F.R. Part 401 with respect to that information.

           For knowingly disclosing information in violation of the Privacy Act, the Contractor and Contractor employees may be subject to the
           criminal penalties as set forth in 5 U.S.C. Section 552(i)(1) to the same extent as employees of SSA.




           For knowingly disclosing confidential information as described in section 1106 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1306), the
           Contractor and Contractor employees may be subject to the criminal penalties as set forth in that provision.

           (h)  The Contractor shall assure that each Contractor employee with access to confidential information is made aware of the
           prescribed rules of conduct, and the criminal penalties for violations of the Privacy Act and/or the Social Security Act.

           (i)  Whenever the Contractor is uncertain how to handle properly any material under the contract, the Contractor must obtain written
           instructions from the Contracting Officer addressing this question.  If the material in question is subject to the Privacy Act and/or
           section 1106 of the Social Security Act or is otherwise confidential information subject to the provisions of this clause, the
           Contractor must obtain a written determination from the Contracting Officer prior to any release, disclosure, dissemination, or
           publication.  Contracting Officer instructions and determinations will reflect the result of internal coordination with appropriate
           program and legal officials.

           (j)   Performance of this contract may involve access to tax return information as defined in 26 U.S.C. Section 6103(b) of the
           Internal Revenue Code (IRC).  All such information shall be confidential and may not be disclosed without the written permission of
           the SSA Contracting Officer.  For willfully disclosing confidential tax return information in violation of the IRC, the Contractor
           and Contractor employees may be subject to the criminal penalties set forth in 26 U.S.C. Section 7213.

           (k)  The Government reserves the right to conduct on-site visits to review the Contractor's documentation and in-house procedures for
           protection of and security arrangements for confidential information and adherence to the terms of this clause.

           (l)  The Contractor must include this clause in all resulting subcontracts whenever there is any indication that the
           subcontractor(s), engaged by the contractor, and their employees or successor subcontractor(s) and their employees might have access
           to SSA's confidential information.


           (m)  The Contractor must assure that its subcontractor(s) and their employees or any successor subcontractor(s) and their employees
           with access to SSA confidential information are made aware of the prescribed rules of conduct.  For knowingly disclosing SSA's
           confidential information, any subcontractor(s) and their employees or successor subcontractor(s) and their employees may be subject
           to criminal penalties as described in section 1106 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1306) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a).



      14.   Selection of Vendor

           The Government intends to award a single delivery order to the vendor that the Government determines to represent the best value and
           results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the
           Government’s needs. The evaluation criteria to be used by the Government are described later in this RFQ.

           FAR 9.103(b) requires that the Contracting Officer make an affirmative determination of responsibility for a prospective contractor
           with respect to any proposed contract award.  Therefore, due consideration shall also be given to those general standards for
           responsible prospective contractors and subcontractors as set forth in FAR 9.104-1, including (but not necessarily limited to)
           whether the vendor is otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations.

                 related set of deliverables.  The Contractor shall list each item exactly how it appears in the SOW and immediately follow with
                 the vendor’s response.  Resumes of the Contractor's project manager and those persons who the Contractor identified as
                 considered essential for the successful performance of this purchase order shall also be included in the Contractor’s Technical
                 Response.








                 Corporate Experience
                 SSA defines Relevant Experience as the knowledge and skills a vendor has obtained by participating in a contract similar to that
                 described in this solicitation.


                 Past Performance
                 Past Performance is a measure of how well a vendor has satisfied customers; adhered to the applicable Federal, state, and local
                 laws and regulations; and conducted its business in an ethical manner.


                 To facilitate the Government's evaluation of past performance and corporate experience, the contractor shall provide information
                 for three relevant contracts for similar services, which the contractor completed within the past 5 years or are still ongoing.
                 The Contractor’s past performance information should document corporate successes in providing services of a similar size,
                 scope, and complexity to those stated in the Government’s SOW.


                 The Contractor’s past performance information must provide sufficient detail to demonstrate that the Contractor has previously
                 performed all aspects of the work detailed in the SOW, and that the Contractor has previously provided the necessary quantity
                 and quality of products and workforce to perform all requirements described in the SOW.

                 Each party (prime contractor, teaming partners and/or proposed sub-contractors) to the response must provide specific past
                 performance reference information for three prior and/or existing contracts that are similar in size, scope and complexity to
                 the role they are proposed to fulfill under the response.



                 All past performance references, both for Government and commercial contracts, shall include the following information:

                                       project, and explain how they were solved/ corrected by the Contractor/contractor.



           Contractors are advised that past performance information may be obtained from other sources known to the Government; and, therefore,
           the Government may evaluate information from such other sources, even though the Contractor does not include such information in its
           response.  Nevertheless, in evaluating the Contractor’s past performance and experience, the Government intends to rely heavily
           (though not necessarily exclusively) upon the information furnished by the Contractor in its Past Performance and experience
           information.






           Therefore, the Contractor is responsible for verifying and ensuring that the information provided in support of its cited/referenced
           past performance is complete, comprehensive, accurate and current as of the month of issuance of this solicitation.


           SSA may verify with the reference that the information is accurate and correct.  If, after two attempts, the cited reference is not
           locatable, then the past performance information will automatically be eliminated from consideration and a rating of Neutral will be
           assigned for that reference.



      2.    EVALUATION OF THE TECHNICAL PORTION OF QUOTATIONS

            The technical portion of the quotations will be evaluated in accordance with the               factors, weights, and order of

           Corporate Experience Evaluation Factors


           Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing at the corporate level.  At the corporate level, previous experiences indicate the
           breadth, depth and relevance of a company’s abilities.


           SSA will evaluate the contractor’s corporate experience performing contracts containing requirements similar in size, scope, and
           complexity to the requirement contained in this solicitation.  The contractor’s corporate experience documentation should
           substantiate its proven corporate experience and clearly demonstrate how the Contractor’s experience is relevant to the work detailed
           in the solicitation as well as describe how the experience will reduce any performance risks.

           The Government will seek to determine whether a Contractor has proven corporate experience to reduce contract performance risk and
           ensure performance success over the life of the contract.  Each cited example of corporate experience will be evaluated separately,
           and an overall rating as described below will be given to the Contractor based upon their demonstrated corporate and key personnel
           experience.  In assessing a Contractor’s Corporate Experience, the Government will consider the Questionnaire results submitted by

      The following adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate the corporate experience factor:

|Excellent            |Contractor has demonstrated extensive corporate experience in performing contracts that are      |
|                     |extremely similar in size, scope and complexity to the stated requirements.  Experience          |
|                     |information indicates low performance risk to the Government.  There are no weaknesses or        |
|                     |deficiencies.                                                                                    |
|Good                 |Contractor has demonstrated corporate experience in performing contracts that are similar in     |

|                     |that are not offset by strengths.                                                                |
|Unsatisfactory       |Contractor has not demonstrated corporate experience in performing contracts that are similar in |
|                     |size, scope and complexity to the stated requirements.  Experience information indicates high    |
|                     |performance risk to the Government.  Experience information has numerous weaknesses.             |



      Past Performance Evaluation Factors

      As specified in the Instructions to Contractors, each Contractor shall provide past performance references for existing and prior contracts
      of similar size, scope and complexity.  The evaluation of past performance will consist of a qualitative assessment of the Contractor’s
      demonstrated success in the performance of previous and/or ongoing contracts of similar size, scope and complexity to the requirement of
      this solicitation.  Evaluation of past performance will be based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  The
      Government will evaluate the relevance of the cited past performance reference information to the requirements stated in this solicitation
      as well as the quality of the Contractor’s past performance and determine each Contractor’s probability of success on the proposed contract
      based upon this record of past performance.  The Government will seek to determine whether a Contractor has consistently demonstrated a
      commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable cost/prices.  The Government shall make an
      assessment of the Contractor’s past performance, taking into account (but not limited to) such aspects as: Quality of Service, Cost
      Control, Timeliness of Performance, Business Relations, Personnel Management and Subcontractor Management.


      Past Performance Evaluation Factors

      • Quality of service – How well was the service delivered; ability to resolve problems; efficiency of personnel.
      • Cost control – How well did estimates match up with actual costs of operations, tasks or projects.


      • Timeliness of performance – Ability to meet delivery schedules; ability to satisfy response time, responsiveness to emergency
        situations.


      • Business relations – Efficiency/effectiveness of vendor management; ability to conduct business in a flexible, proactive, cooperative
        manner; overall customer satisfaction.
1.

      • Personnel and Subcontractor Management – How well did the contracted personnel contribute to the objectives of the contract.  How did
        the contractor staff, utilize and maintain personnel to achieve the contractual requirement.

In assessing a Contractor’s Past performance, the Government will consider the Questionnaire results submitted by the Contractor’s references
and may consider information from other sources including the contractor, and may consider information from other sources such as, but not
limited to information contained in Government past performance databases.  Each reference Questionnaire will be evaluated separately, as
described above, and an overall (as described below) will be given to the Contractor based upon the trends their past performance has
demonstrated and the Contractor’s probability of success on the proposed contract based upon their record of past performance.




The following adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate the past performance factor:

|Excellent          |Past performance is highly similar and relevant to the stated requirements in size, scope and    |
|                   |complexity.  Past performance, record is entirely favorable and there are no unfavorable comments|
|                   |from references.  The past performance record possesses exceptional strengths.                   |
|Good               |Past performance is similar and relevant to the stated requirements in size, scope and           |
|                   |complexity.  Past performance record is more favorable than unfavorable.  Unfavorable references,|
|                   |if any, are minor and are more than offset by favorable references.                              |
|Acceptable         |Past performance is somewhat similar and relevant to the stated requirements in size, scope and  |
|                   |complexity.  Has favorable and unfavorable references.  Unfavorable references are generally     |
|                   |offset by favorable references.                                                                  |
|Marginal           |Past performance is not similar and relevant to the stated requirements in size, scope, and      |
|                   |complexity. More unfavorable than favorable past performance record.  Unfavorable references are |
|                   |not offset by favorable references.                                                              |
|Not Applicable     |No relevant past performance information is available for evaluation; or, Contractor has no      |
|                   |relevant experience.                                                                             |
|                   |Quotation is neither rated favorably or unfavorably.                                             |

(NOTE: In the case of a Contractor without a record of relevant experience, or for whom information on past performance is not available, the
Contractor will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, as per the guidance established at FAR 15.305.)
