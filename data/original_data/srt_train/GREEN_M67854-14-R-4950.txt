MCSC SECTION B SECTION B ­ SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES B.1 CONTRACTING STRATEGY The Government intends to award a multiple award IDIQ contract resulting from this RFP. Awards will be made to the offeror(s) that the Source Selection Authority (SSA) determines to be the most advantageous to the Government representing the best value, technical capability, past performance, price, and other factors considered. B.2 CONTRACT MINIMUM & MAXIMIMUM LIMITATIONS The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) requirements are addressed in the Performance Work Statement, Attachment 1. A Multiple Award Firm Fixed-Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) delivery order contract will be awarded that will utilize Firm Fixed-Price Delivery Orders for performance. Two Delivery Orders, 0001 and 0002 addressed below, may be issued at the time of award or shortly thereafter. The Government reserves the right to issue only Delivery Order 0001 at the time of award.

The contract minimum requirement will be met by the issuance of Delivery Order 0001, which will be issued with the initial contract award, or shortly thereafter. Based on evaluation criteria set forth in a subsequent task order solicitation, and the provisions of FAR16.505, the Government will then select a contractor for award of the WRI fielding solution for that particular installation. Under the provisions of FAR 16.505, the Government will issue further task order solicitations to awardees of this IDIQ contract for the design and fielding of the remaining WRI solutions at the installations identified in the PWS.

MCSC SECTION H SPECIAL CONTRACT CONSIDERATIONS H.1 SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION GOALS The total Small Business participation goals are shown below. It is the Government's minimum mandatory requirement for Large Businesses (not having an approved Commercial Plan in accordance with FAR Part 19.704) that 23 percent of the total annual contract sales per Large Business contractor be directed to small businesses via subcontracts. See FAR 52.219-9. If offerors are a Small Business the percentages (%) described below do not apply. Refer to the following table regarding the Government's small business participation requirements. For Large Businesses of the 23% total 16% of the requirements must be allocated pursuant to the following table; the Offeror has the discretion to allocate the remaining 7% between the categories in the table below: Note: Offeror's qualifying as a Small Business may allocate business as specified in the table below or provide with its proposal a breakout of percentages % (if applicable). Category Small Business (minimum) (inclusive of all categories noted below) Small Disadvantaged Business (minimum) Woman-Owned Small Business (minimum) Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) (minimum) Hub-Zone Small Business (minimum) Requirements 23% total 5% 5% 3% 3%

H.2 ELECTRONIC SUBCONTRACT REPORTING SYSTEM (ESRS) Offeror's are required to use the eSRS for reporting their subcontracting efforts. In accordance with FAR 52.219-9, the contractor agrees to submit the Individual Subcontracting Report (ISR), formerly the SF-294, and Summary Subcontracting Report (SSR), formerly the SF-295, as applicable. Pursuant to FAR 19.704, the Government requires submission of these reports as follows: The ISR is due semi-annually and at contract completion, always within 30 days after the close of each reporting period unless otherwise directed by the KO. Normally these deadlines are April 30th for the period ending March 31st and October 30th for the period ending September 30th. A separate report is also due within 30 days after contract completion. Reports are required when due, regardless of

M67854-14-R-4950 Page 13 of 61 whether there has been any subcontracting activity since the inception of the contract or since the last reporting period. The SSR must be submitted annually (for twelve months ending September 30th). Additional information concerning the eSRS program can be located at http://www.acquisition.gov and https://esrs.gov.

H.3 SECTION 508 PUBLIC LAW (a) Public Law 105-220, enacted on August 7, 1998, better known as the Section 508 Law http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.php requires that when Federal Agencies develop, procure, maintain or use Electronic, and Information Technology (E&IT), the E&IT must be accessible to individuals with disabilities and comply with the United States Access Board Standards http://www.access-board.gov. This section requires that the vendor comply with Section 508 Technical Standards found in Subpart B -- 1194.26 (Desktop and portable computers) which states that (a) All mechanically operated controls and keys shall comply with §1194.23 (k) (1) through(4) and (b) If a product utilizes touch screens or touch-operated controls, an input method shall be provided that complies with §1194.23 (k) (1) through (4). (b) When biometric forms of user identification or control are used, an alternative form of identification or activation, which does not require the user to possess particular biological characteristics, shall also be provided. (c) Where provided, at least one of each type of expansion slots, ports and connectors shall comply with publicly available industry standards. Additionally, the vendor must submit evidence of product accessibility features by providing a VPAT along with proposal response or by completing the GPAT.

H.4 E-LMR WRI WARRANTIES AND ASSOCIATED WARRANTY, REPAIR DATA The contractor shall provide a three-year E-LMR WRI system warranty, OEM warranties, and associated data. DoD requires warranty tracking of serialized items with guidance information provided in DFARS 252.246-7005 and DFARS 252.246-7006.

H.5 UNIQUE IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION Unique Identification (UID) is an international standards based approach adopted by the DoD that makes the acquisition, repair, and deployment of items faster and more efficient. This is achieved by: (1) Marking qualifying items with a machine-readable data matrix mark that contains a permanent, globally unique and unambiguous identifier called a Unique Item Identifier (UII), and (2) Capturing specific lifecycle item data for the UII in a centralized database, called the IUID Registry. The result is easier access to authoritative information about UII marked items throughout their life in the DoD inventory and Government Furnished Property (GFP) in the hands of contractors. The UII can then be leveraged as a common data key across functionally disparate data systems. Because the mark is machine-readable, human error in data entry is eliminated, significantly improving the accuracy of inventory and acquisition records. H.6 DoD CONTRACT SECURITY CLASSIFICATION SPECIFICATION A draft DD Form 254, DoD Contract Security Classification Specification is incorporated herein as solicitation Attachment (3). A finalized DD Form 254 will be incorporated after award.

G.2 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (a) "Organizational Conflict of Interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage. "Person" as used herein includes corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, and other business enterprises. (b) The contractor warrants that to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as otherwise set forth in the contract, the contractor does not have any organizational conflict of interest(s) as defined in paragraph (a). (c) It is recognized that the effort to be performed by the Contractor under this contract may create a potential organizational conflict of interest on the instant contract or on a future acquisition. In order to avoid potential conflict of interest, and at the same time to avoid prejudicing the best interest of the government, the right of the contractor to participate in future procurement of equipment and/or services that are the subject of any work under this contract shall be limited as described below in accordance with the requirements of FAR 9.5. (d) (1) The contractor agrees that it shall not release, disclose, or use in any way that would permit or result in disclosure to any party outside the government any information provided to the contract by the government during or

M67854-14-R-4950 Page 15 of 61 as a result of performance of this contract. Such information includes, but is not limited to, information submitted to the government on confidential basis by other persons. Further, the prohibition against release of government provided information extends to cover such information whether or not in its original form, e.g., where the information has been included in contractor generated work or where it is discernible from materials incorporating or based upon such information. This prohibition shall not expire after a given period of time. (2) The contractor agrees that it shall not release, disclose, or use in any way that would permit or result in disclosure or any party outside the government any information generated or derived during or as a result of performance of this contract. This prohibition shall expire after a period of three years after completion of performance of this contract. (3) The prohibitions contained in subparagraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) shall apply with equal force to any affiliate of the contractor, any subcontractor, consultant, or employee of the contractor, any joint venture involving the contractor, any entity into or with which it may merge or affiliate, or any successor or assign of the contractor. The terms of paragraph (f) of the Special Contractor Requirement relating to notification shall apply to any release of information in contravention of this paragraph (d). (e) This exclusion does not apply to any re-competition for those systems, components, or services on the basis of work statements growing out of the effort performed under this contract, from a source other than the contractor, subcontractor affiliate, or assign of either, during the course of performance of this contract or before the three year period following completion of this contract has lapsed, the contractor may, with the authorization of the cognizant contracting officer, participate in a subsequent procurement for the same system, component, or service. In other words, the contractor may be authorized to compete for procurement(s) for systems, components or services subsequent to an intervening procurement. (f) The contractor agrees that, if after award, it discovers an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest; it shall make immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer. The notification shall include a description of the actual or potential organizational conflict of interest, a description of the action, which the contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict, and any other relevant information that would assist the contracting officer in making a determination on this matter. Notwithstanding this notification, the government may terminate the contract for the convenience of the government if determined to be in the best interest of the government. (g) Notwithstanding paragraph (f) above, if the contractor was aware, or should have been aware, of an organizational conflict of interest prior to the award of this contract or becomes, or should become aware of an organizational conflict or interest after award of this contract and does not make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the contracting officer, the government may terminate this contract for default. (h) If the contactor takes any action prohibited by this requirement or fails to take action required by this requirement, the government may terminate this contract for default. (i) The contracting officer's decision as to the existence or nonexistence of an actual or potential organization conflict of interest shall be final and is not subject to the clause of this contract entitled "DISPUTES" (FAR 52.233.1). (j) Nothing in this requirement is intended to prohibit or preclude the contractor from marketing or selling to the United States Government its product lines in existence on the effective date of this contract; nor, shall this requirement preclude the contractor from participating in any research and development. Additionally, sale of catalog or standard commercial items are exempt from this requirement. (k) The contractor shall promptly notify the contracting officer, in writing, if it has been tasked to evaluate or advise the government concerning its own products or activities or those of a competitor in order to ensure proper safeguards exist to guarantee objectivity and to protect the government's interest.

M67854-14-R-4950 Page 16 of 61 (l) The contractor shall include this requirement in subcontracts of any tier which involve access to information or situations/conditions covered by the preceding paragraphs, substituting "subcontractor" for "contactor" where appropriate. (m) The rights and remedies described herein shall not be exclusive and are in addition to other rights and remedies provided by law or elsewhere included elsewhere in this contract. (n) Compliance with this requirement is a material requirement of this contract.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

ATTACHMENT 2 - EVALUATION ­ COMMERCIAL ITEMS 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: See addendum below: 52.212-2 Addendum Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions. Each Offeror's proposal shall contain the Offeror's best price and technical position. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later deemed necessary. Any Offeror that is rated "Marginal" or "Unacceptable" in any evaluation criterion will not be considered for contract award. In order for a proposal to be considered acceptable under the terms of this RFP, the Offeror's proposal MUST meet all Marine Corps Systems Command and PWS requirements. Unsupported promises to comply with the contractual requirements will not be sufficient. The Government may award to other than the lowest-priced Offeror or to other than the Offeror with the highest technical rating if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government. The Government intends to award one or more contracts to the most qualified Offerors resulting from this RFP: (a) Whose proposal is technically acceptable. (b) Whose offer is deemed responsive to the solicitation requirement. (c) Whose overall offer represents "Best Value" to the Government. In making its "Trade Off" determination, the Government will consider all non-price factors, combined, to be of significantly greater importance than evaluated price. Evaluation Areas and Factors General. The Government will apply the following evaluation factors and elements to identify the best value proposal. The evaluation factors represent key areas of importance to be considered in the source selection decision. The factors and elements have been chosen to support meaningful discrimination between and among competing proposals. The proposals will be evaluated against the Government's requirements using five factors. Technical Approach, Management Approach and Sustainment Approach are of equal importance, and are more important than Past Performance. Technical Approach, Management Approach, Sustainment Approach and Past Performance, when taken together are significantly more important than Price. Factor 1 ­ Technical Approach Factor 2 ­ Management Approach Factor 3 ­ Sustainment Approach Factor 4 ­ Past Performance Information Factor 5 ­ Price Proposal (evaluated but not rated) Procedures. The Price Volume will be evaluated separately from the Technical Volume, but not rated. An adjectival rating and risk assessment will be used to establish technical merit and performance risk for the Technical Volume, Management Volume and Sustainment Volume. Adjectival Rating: The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) will use four (4) adjectival ratings of

M67854-14-R-4950 Page 55 of 61 Exceptional, Acceptable, Marginal, and Unacceptable for the Technical Approach, Management Approach and Sustainment Approach. The proposal rating depicts how well the Offeror's proposal meets the evaluation standards and the solicitation requirements. Technical Approach, Management Approach and Sustainment Approach Ratings: Technical Rating Evaluation Processes. The technical rating reflects the degree to which the proposed approach meets or does not meet the RFP's requirements through a qualitative assessment of a proposal's strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses, deficiencies, omissions and/or risks. The adjectival ratings listed below will be applied ONLY at the Factor level; they will NOT be applied at the element level. Note: Technical ratings are merely guides for intelligent decision making. Thus, even if one or more Offeror received the same technical factor rating(s), the fact that the rating is the same does not indicate the proposals are technically equal or the same; qualitative distinctions may exist even between proposals that receive the same factor rating(s). Table 4, Combined Technical/Risk Ratings Rating Description Outstanding Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach to and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. Good Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach to and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low. Acceptable Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach to and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate. Marginal Proposal does not clearly meet one or more requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach to and understanding of one or more requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. Unacceptable Proposal does not meet multiple requirements or contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable. Definitions. Strength (S): A proposal element that increases the likelihood of successful contract performance, or provides an approach directly related to the requirement reasonably thought to exceed the minimum requirement. Significant Strength (SS): A proposal element that appreciably increases the likelihood of successful contract performance, or provides an approach directly related to the requirement reasonably thought to exceed the minimum requirement. Weakness (W): A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.

M67854-14-R-4950 Page 56 of 61

Significant Weakness (SW): A flaw in the proposal that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.

Deficiency (D): Material failure in a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. Omission (O): Information requested in the RFP that was not provided in the proposal. An omission of requested data that renders the proposal impossible to evaluate may result in the proposal being deemed unacceptable. A minor data omission is not necessarily a deficiency. Risk (R): A proposal element that has the potential to cause a disruption of schedule, an increase in cost, or a degradation of performance.

Past Performance Information: The Government will identify and assess the relevancy and recency of each of the Offeror's Past Performance exemplars utilizing the following definitions: Assessment Very Relevant/High Definition Present/past performance effort involved the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. This includes examples of integration of all products proposed for E-LMR, Federal IA requirements, integration with legacy equipment, multi-team/multi-site employments. Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

Relevant/Medium Not Relevant/Low

The Government will assign a single, overall Past Performance Confidence rating as defined below, based on an analysis of the relevance and the quality of the evaluated past performance information. Rating Substantial Confidence Definition Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the Offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. No recent/relevant performance record is available or the Offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.

1

Purpose
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and applied document used to ensure that systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of this performance-based service order. The intent is to verify that the contractor performs in accordance with (IAW) the performance metrics and that the Government receives services at the quality level called for in the contract. This requirement addresses contractor services necessary for the Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (E-LMR) Western Region Infrastructure (WRI) project effort under the cognizance of the United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Program Manager (PM) Information Systems and Infrastructure (IS&I) Product Manager (PdM), Emergency Response Systems (ERS). The resulting vehicle will be a multiple-award, Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (ID / IQ) contract. This contract will be for a (3) three year base period with (2) two option years. A properly executed QASP will assist the Government in achieving the objectives of this procurement. The support services to be provided shall include, but not be limited to: program management, systems engineering, system test and evaluation, information assurance (IA) accreditation and certification, new equipment training, site installation / activation, technical documentation, and sustainment and warranty services. The plan is designed to limit surveillance to the necessary measures to verify the contractor is satisfactorily performing services directly related to the performance requirements of the E-LMR WRI Performance Work Statement (PWS).

2

Authority
Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under Contract Section E ­ Inspection and Acceptance, which provides for inspections and acceptance of the services and documentation called for in service contracts, to be executed by the Contracting Officer or a duly authorized representative.

3

Scope
The QASP is put in place to provide Government surveillance and oversight of the contractor's efforts to assure that they are timely, effective, and are delivering the results specified in the E-LMR WRI contract. As part of the QASP, the Government will provide an evaluation in the Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS) at the end of each task order period. The contractor's
5

performance on this ID / IQ contract will be evaluated by the Government as described below. The first evaluation will cover the surveillance period ending with each task order period after date of contract award. Additionally, successive evaluations will be performed for each task order period thereafter until the contractor completes performance of all task orders (if awarded) under this contract. For the first surveillance period and each subsequent task order period, the Government will evaluate the contractor's performance using the surveillance methods outlined in Section 6. The evaluation will encompass all work performed by the contractor at any time during the task order period but will not include cumulative information from prior reports. For each task order, the contractor will complete a self-assessment of the performance provided, to be delivered to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and Contracting Officer no later than (NLT) 60 days prior to the end of the period of performance. The self-assessment shall cover all areas of the Government QASP. Based on the evaluation results, the Contracting Officer will assign an overall performance rating. If the Contracting Officer assigns an overall "Unsatisfactory" performance rating for the period evaluated, the next option period will not be exercised.

4

Government Resources
The following definitions for Government resources are applicable to this plan: a. Contracting Officer: A person duly appointed with the authority to enter into contracts and make related determinations and findings on behalf of the Government. The contracting officer is identified in Section G of the contract. Contracting Officers are designated via a written warrant which sets forth limitations of authority. b. Contracting Officer's Representative (COR): An individual appointed in writing by the contracting officer to act as their authorized representative to assist in administering the contract. The COR will be designated in the resulting contract. The COR engages in Government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or changes that will affect price, quality, quantity, delivery, or any other term or condition of the contract. The limitations of authority are contained in a written letter of designation. c. Technical Point of Contact (TPOC): An individual designated by the COR to serve as the coordinator and lead technical Government representative
6

for the E-LMR WRI activity efforts. d. Contract Specialist: An individual assigned by the contracting officer to carry out the day to day contractual requirements of the delivery orders.

5

Responsibilities
The following Government resources shall have responsibility for the implementation of this QASP: a. Contracting Officer: The Contracting Officer ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract, and safeguards the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship. It is the Contracting Officer that assures the contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under the contract. The Contracting Officer is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor's performance b. Contracting Officer's Representative: The COR is responsible for technical administration of the contract and assures proper Government surveillance of the contractor's technical performance. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the contractor believes may affect contract price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action. c. Technical Point of Contact: The TPOC is responsible for the technical review and contract compliance by the contractor to individual task orders. The TPOC will be responsible for the following: definition of contract tasks and subtasks; review of requested delivery order work orders, and sourcing concurrence for delivery orders; and resume qualification review/approval for key positions. The TPOC is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the contractor believes may affect contract price, terms or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action. d. Contract Specialist: The Contract Specialist is a DAWIA Level I, II or III certified individual assigned to assist in the daily administration of the contract. The specialist may also provide input to the contracting officer and the COR as to the quality of performance areas addressed in the QASP.

6

Methods of QA Surveillance
The COR will use the surveillance methods listed below in the administration of this QASP to determine whether the contractor is effectively and efficiently complying with all terms and conditions of the contract, PWS, System Design
7

Specification (SDS), and Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). The Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) listed in Appendix A, contains the performance objectives that are being measured. In addition, the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form, provided as Appendix B, will be used to document the findings. a. Inspection: A method carried out by visual examination. i. Monthly: The COR shall review the generated documentation (e.g., meeting minutes, engineering reviews, data from testing, reports, or installation documentation) and enter summary results into the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form. Ad hoc: The COR shall conduct ad hoc inspections as required and enter summary results into the Quality Assurance Monitoring Form.

ii.

b. Analysis: A method carried out by detailed examinations, calculations, and tests derived from data associated with a deliverable to determine if applications and / or techniques are appropriate and effective. c. Demonstration: A method carried out by operation of the system, or part of the system, that relies on observable functional operation. d. Test: A method using instrumentation or calibrated test equipment to obtain performance data for subsequent analysis. e. Customer Feedback: A method by which installation operators may submit feedback on the performance of the system. f. CPARS: An evaluation will be performed as described above. The Government will address the quality of product or service, schedule, cost control, business relations, and management, as this information may affect future source selections throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) and the continuation of the order. The CPARS assessment will be used appropriately as an additional performance oversight and communication tool with the QASP.

7

Documentation
In addition to providing quarterly reports to the Contracting Officer, the COR will maintain a complete Quality Assurance file. The file will contain copies of all reports, evaluations, recommendations, and any actions related to the Government's performance of the quality assurance function. All such records will be maintained for the life of the contract. The COR shall forward these records to the Contracting Officer at termination or completion of the contract.

8

8

Ratings
The table below sets forth the performance ratings and standards the Government shall use to grade contractor performance. The Government will evaluate the contractor's performance of the PWS for each task order, and the Contracting Officer will assign one of the following ratings:

9

Exceptional Very Good Satisfactory Marginal e. Unsatisfactory The standards associated with these ratings are given in Table 1. The ratings shall be provided to the Contracting Officer at the end of each surveillance period. Table 1 Overall Performance Ratings
Overall Performance Standard Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the task and sub-task being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.

a. b. c. d.

Exceptional

Very Good

Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the task and sub-task being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.

Satisfactory

Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the task and sub-task contain some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.

Marginal

Performance does not meet contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the task and sub-task being assessed reflect a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the task or sub-task contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's actions appear or were ineffective.

Unsatisfactory

The Contracting Officer will make a performance determination for each task order at the end of each evaluation period. The determination will be based upon the COR's recommendations, the contractor's comments including any Self-Evaluation Report, and any other information deemed relevant by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer shall resolve disagreements between the COR's recommendations and the contractor's comments/reports regarding the evaluation. The Contracting Officer's performance evaluation is unilateral and final. The Contracting Officer will document the determinationand provide a copy to the contractor within 30 days of receipt of the contractor's self- assessment.

9

Identified QA Surveillance Tasks
Appendix A sets forth the performance standards and surveillance methods for the contractor and COR while Appendix B provides the checklist and means for the COR to document the results of the surveillance. Appendix B will be provided to the Contracting Officer on a quarterly basis. Appendix C provides a method of documenting contract discrepancies for remediation.
