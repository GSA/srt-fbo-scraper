And Customer Wait Time (CWT)

 17 November 2014





1.0 BACKGROUND



DLA Transaction Services designs, develops, operates and maintains a centralized value-added suite of online Automated Information Systems (AISs), designed for the processing and storage of logistics data.   These AISs are managed through four separate profiles composed of DLA Transaction Services Baseline Services (DBase), Department of Defense (DoD) Gateway Services (DGate), DoD Data Services (DData) and Electronic Business Services (EBus).  DLA Transaction Services is in the process of enhancing and maintaining existing application processes and existing web enabled processes to the maximum extent possible, to empower the users of DLA Transaction Services, and assist in the minimization of DLA Transaction Services resources to support these services.  This performance work statement is to continue in those efforts.  



2.0 SCOPE



The Contractor shall be responsible for performing separate tasks in support of the DLA Transaction Services Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS), including logistics analysis, reporting, and web application initiatives identified under the DLA Transaction Services DData profile. The Contractor shall be required to collaborate with the various Government teams and other DLA Transaction Services Contractor teams to ensure this initiative is successful. 

 

3.0 OBJECTIVES



The Contractor shall be responsible for the Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS) that currently maintains logistics pipeline information for all DOD wholesale items. The Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System/Customer Wait Time (LMARS/CWT) System continues to need development,  enhancement and support in order to provide current and additional LMARS/CWT committee reporting requirement and Top 100 (total processing time) drilldown capabilities to enable the DoD Logistics Managers to efficiently and effectively manage their processes. The current LMARS/CWT reporting system provides a set of committee-defined standard reports and drilldowns. The DoD and Joint Staff are requesting more reporting and drilldown capabilities in support of strategic logistics planning goals and objectives. A suite of On Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Reporting module tools are being utilized to meet these demands. This PWS will provide for the professional support to continue to integrate, enhance, maintain and support these tools and to provide sustainment of the existing LMARS/LRT/CWT reporting capability and establish the structure for future reporting requirements.

 

All work performed under this contract will be done in accordance with the baselines established by DLA Transaction Services. Any changes to these baselines may impact performance.

SECTION L



Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors or Respondents



1.   PROGRAM INFORMATION



1.1	Program Structure and Objectives

DLA Transaction Service’s requirement is to perform separate tasks in support of the DLA Transaction Services Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS), including logistics analysis, reporting, and web application initiatives identified under the DLA Transaction Services DData profile. The Contractor shall be responsible for the Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS) that currently maintains logistics pipeline information for all DOD wholesale items. The Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System/Customer Wait Time (LMARS/CWT) System continues to need development,  enhancement and support in order to provide current and additional LMARS/CWT committee reporting requirement and Top 100 (total processing time) drilldown capabilities to enable the DoD Logistics Managers to efficiently and effectively manage their processes. The current LMARS/CWT reporting system provides a set of committee-defined standard reports and drilldowns. The DoD and Joint Staff are requesting more reporting and drilldown capabilities in support of strategic logistics planning goals and objectives. A suite of On Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Reporting module tools are being utilized to meet these demands. This PWS will provide for the professional support to continue to integrate, enhance, maintain and support these tools and to provide sustainment of the existing LMARS/LRT/CWT reporting capability and establish the structure for future reporting requirements.

This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.  Merely having problems does not automatically equate to an unacceptable rating, since the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to overcome the problems encountered.  The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified.  This may allow the offeror to be considered more favorably than without evidence of problem resolution.  For example, submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that clearly support that an offeror has overcome past problems is required.  Categorize the relevant information into the specific Technical subfactors and Price factor used to evaluate the proposal.



5.4.2 Organizational Structure Change History 



Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc.  In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition.  To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of your company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice.  As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment.  Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offeror(s), your "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources.





6. Volume IV - Price 



6.1 General Instructions



6.1.1 Price Reasonableness



This section is to assist you in submitting data other than certified cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness and balance of your proposed cost/price. Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your proposal. Note that unrealistically low or high proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal.  Additionally, unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror’s proposal.  Offers should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and balance. The burden of proof for credibility of proposed prices rests with the offeror.



6.1.2 Price Data



Data beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your price position.  All data relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation, must be included in the section of the proposal designated as the Price volume.  Under no circumstances shall this data and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal.

1 GENERAL



1.1 Basis for Contract Award

This is a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15, Contracting by Negotiation, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), DoD Source Selection Procedures, Appendix A, 04 March 2011 and Air Force Mandatory Procedures 5315.3.  These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FARSite, . The Government will select the proposal with the lowest evaluated price from among those meeting the acceptability standards for non-price factors.  



1.2  Contract(s) may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR Part 9.1, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation’s requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors, to represent the lowest price technically acceptable proposal.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.



1.3 Number of Contracts to be Awarded
The Government intends to award a single contract to perform all of the functions defined in this solicitation; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals submitted or budgetary limitations.



1.4 Correction Potential of Proposals

The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency.  The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government.  If an aspect of an offeror's proposal does not meet the Government's requirements and is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.



1.5 Discussions

The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.  If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision.  If the offeror’s proposal has been evaluated as Acceptable at the time discussions are closed, any changes or exceptions in the Final Proposal Revision are subject to evaluation and may introduce risk that the offeror’s proposal be determined Unacceptable and, thus, ineligible for award.







1.6 Solicitation Requirements, Terms & Conditions
Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as factors or subfactors.  Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the offeror being ineligible for award.  Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and must provide complete supporting rationale.  The Government reserves the right to determine any such exceptions unacceptable.



2.0 EVALUATION FACTORS



2.1 Evaluation Factors and Subfactors

The following evaluation factors and subfactors will be used to evaluate each proposal. The Government will evaluate proposals for acceptability, but will not rank the proposals by the non-price factors or subfactors. 



Factor 1: Technical

Subfactor 1: IT Support Requirements

	Subfactor 2: Management Approach

Factor 2: Past Performance

Factor 3: Price 



2.2 Technical Factor

The Government’s technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals on pass/fail basis, assigning one of the ratings described below for each subfactor. Any subfactor evaluated as “Unacceptable” will render the entire proposal unacceptable and, therefore, unawardable.  Only those proposals determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. However, the offeror is cautioned that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion.  

  



The proposal shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:



Subfactor 1: IT Support Requirements



Description:   This subfactor will evaluate the Offeror’s ability to satisfy the requirements specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Section 3.



Measure of Merit:  This requirement is met when the offeror’s proposal clearly describes a comprehensive approach to meeting the performance thresholds for :  

a)Expertise with software tools; Web Intelligence, Business Objects, Crystal Decisions Enterprise and Reports, COBOL, Excel Visual Basic, TOAD, Oracle, SQLPLUS, SFTP and UNIX; 

b) Produce and maintain weekly, monthly and quarterly charts and Excel spreadsheets for reports on the web page;

c) Provide and maintain usage of software provided, to produce drilldowns that provide the details behind each cell on the spreadsheet;  

d) Develop, document, test, integrate and display on the web page all new committee or program manager requested reports or spreadsheets;  

e) Maintain and enhance LMARS reporting capabilities to generate reports for immediate issue items;  

f) Develop, document, test, integrate and maintain SFTP data feeds from various armed services or government agencies;  

g) Provide and maintain usage of software  provided to produce frequent distribution charts for all data in user requested formats such as pie bar charts;  

h) Support security readiness reviews of the LMARS/CWT system; 

 i) Immediately rectify all system and program errors;  

j) Provide bi-weekly status updates on Incidents and Change Requests;

k) Perform system integration and testing support on Compaq DEC systems and other DLA Transaction Services platforms; 

l) Setup routing correlation tables and document the setup routing in a configuration integration plan; 

m) Monitor customer input, system output, system data flow and maintain a testing status log for all system testing performed during the maintenance 

n) Work with DLA Transaction Services customers and DLA Transaction Services logistics personnel to remedy all errors and reprocess any transactions not posted due to an error.  Then retest the system to ensure the erroneous, unprocessed transaction is posted and saved by the system; 

o) Participate in designing and maintaining logistics transaction processing rules and procedures: 

p) Respond to customer questions about DLA Transaction Services systems and processes and their relationship to and interaction with customer systems and processes.





Subfactor 2:  Management Approach



Description:   This subfactor evaluates the offeror’s overall management and staffing  approaches to accomplish the requirments of the PWS.



Measure of Merit:  This subfactor is met when the offeror’s proposal descibes a sound approach:   

a) provide contract oversight for management of staffing, contract deliverables, personnel training and fulfillment of Services Summary as defined in Section 11.0 of the PWS;  

b) provide personnel with the necessary skills to perform the tasks within each functional area;  

c) provide a clear understanding of the security requirement detailed in Section 12.0 of the PWS; 

d) provide appropriate number of personnel possessing the appropriate security clearance to perform the tasks within each functional area on Day 1 of contract performance.



2.3 Past Performance Factor 

The Past Performance evaluation results in an assessment of the offeror’s probability of meeting the solicitation requirements.  Offerors must receive a past performance rating of “Acceptable” to be eligible for award. 



2.3.1 Ratings.  The Past Performance factor will receive one of the ratings described below.

2.3.2 Evaluation Process. The past performance evaluation considers each offeror’s demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet the solicitation requirements.  In conducting the Past Performance evaluation, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided in the offeror’s Past Performance proposal volume and information obtained from other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to: the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS); Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS); Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; and interviews/questionnaires with Program Managers, Contracting Officers and Fee Determining Officials, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and commercial sources.



2.3.2.1 Recency Assessment

An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.



2.3.2.2 Relevancy Assessment

The Government will conduct an evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine whether the products provided/services performed under those contracts relate to the Technical subfactors.  For each recent past performance citation reviewed, the relevance of the work performed will generally be assessed for the Technical subfactors (however, all aspects of performance that relate to this acquisition may be considered). Consideration will be given to relevant present/past performance effort involved with similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. A relevancy determination of the offeror’s past performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations, including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s).  In determining the relevancy of effort performed under individual past performance contracts, the government will only consider the specific effort or portion consistent with that proposed by the prime, subcontractor or teaming partner.  The past performance information forms (PIFs) and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance.  The Government will use the following relevancy definitions when assessing recent, relevant contracts: 











2.3.2.3 Performance Quality Assessment

The Government will consider the performance quality of recent, relevant efforts (how well the contractor performed on the contracts).  For each recent, relevant past performance citation reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed for the Technical subfactors (however, all aspects of performance that relate to this acquisition may be considered).  Pursuant to , the assessment will also consider the extent to which the offeror’s evaluated past performance demonstrates compliance with , Utilization of Small Business Concerns and , Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  The quality assessment may result in positive or adverse findings.  Adverse is defined as past performance information that supports an unsatisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system.  For adverse information identified, the evaluation will consider the number and severity of the problem(s), mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of corrective actions that have resulted in sustained improvements.  Process changes will only be considered when objectively measurable improvements in performance have been demonstrated.  The Government will use the following quality levels when assessing recent, relevant efforts: 







2.3.3 Assigning Ratings.  As a result of the relevancy and performance quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated past performance rating at the factor level (see Table 2).  More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Past Performance rating than less recent or relevant effort.  



2.4 Price Factor

Price proposals will be evaluated for (1) completeness, (2) reasonableness, (3) unbalanced pricing, and (4) Total Evaluated Price. Offerors whose price is determined to be incomplete, unreasonable or unbalanced may not be considered for award.



2.4.1 Completeness.  The Government will review the pricing submissions for all information submitted as instructed in Section L, in the prescribed format, and error free and in compliance with Section L of the solicitation.

  



2.4.2 Reasonableness: The offeror’s Price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in , in order to determine if it is reasonable. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay in the conduct of competitive business. Normally, price reasonableness is established through price analysis techniques as described in . For additional information see . 



2.4.3  Unbalanced Pricing:  The Government will analyze each proposal to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to prices in accordance with FAR 15.404-1.  An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.



2.4.4 Total Evaluated Price (TEP): The TEP will be evaluated using the attached Pricing Matrix to be filled out be each offeror. The sum of all labor categories and the not-to-exceed travel amount will determine the price for each period. The TEP is the sum of the basic period plus all option periods including the six-month option to extension of services in accordance with .  TEP will be used for evaluation purposes only; evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.



2.4.5 Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.



3 PRE-AWARD SURVEY



The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offeror's capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.

11.1 Final Deliverables The Contractor shall report significant problems as soon as they are identified to the DLA Transaction Services COR. The Contractor shall provide informal and formal reviews and reports as required ensuring DLA Transaction Service's overall awareness on project status and for coordination. The Contractor shall make recommendations for Government action whenever such action is indicated. The Contractor shall attend formal contract review meetings as directed by the DLA Transaction Services. 12.0 SECURITY This Project is Unclassified. The below security requirements apply to the prime contractor and all subcontractors. All personnel working under this Order will occupy an ADP/IT-I position. It is the Contractor's responsibility to ensure a record check has been performed through the local Police Department on all employees hired to support this effort. If a discrepancy is discovered during the security clearance process that would have been discovered through the local records check, the Contractor shall bear the cost for the security clearance investigation process. The Contractor shall certify, in writing to the COR that Contractor personnel have obtained the proper clearance or waiver and request that their personnel be allowed to begin work under this PWS. The COR will verify the clearance and/or waiver with the DLA Transaction Services Security Manager and provide written authorization to the Contractor with an effective date the Contractor personnel can officially begin working against this contract. 12.1 Personnel Security ADP/IT-I Access -- Contractor personnel working against this contract requiring access to DLA Transaction Services systems that require privileged (system administrator) access are considered to be occupying an ADP-I position if their work will not be technically reviewed by a higher authority in the ADP-I category (reference DoD 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, Appendix 10) and as such, will require a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) at a minimum before the Contractor employee can work or bill against this contract. If the proposed Contractor employee does not currently have a favorably adjudicated SSBI, the Contractor employee must complete and submit a Standard Form 86 (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions) for a SSBI and provide favorably adjudicated SSBI findings to DLA Transaction Services before the Contractor employee can work or bill against this contract. In addition, the Contractor is required to provide proof to DLA Transaction Services that the favorably adjudicated SSBI is on file with the Government prior to the Contractor employee commencing work or billing against this contract. An SSBI can take up to 120 days to complete, and another 45 days for adjudication. The first part of an SSBI, which is a National Agency Check (NAC), is usually completed in 35 days. A waiver for ADP-I can be submitted by DLA Transaction Services and approved by HQ DLA once the NAC portion of the investigation has been completed. Once the investigation and/or waiver have been approved, the billing cycle can begin.

ADP/IT-II Access -- Contractor personnel working against this contract requiring access to DLA Transaction Services systems and whose work is technically reviewed by a higher authority in the ADP-I category (reference DoD 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, Appendix 10) are considered to be occupying an ADP-II position and will require a favorable National Agency Check with Local Agency Check and Credit Check (NACLC) before the Contractor employee can work or bill against this contract. If the proposed Contractor employee does not currently have a NACLC on file they must apply for an ADP-II position (reference DoD 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, Appendix 10) by completing and submitting a Standard Form 86 (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions) for an NACLC. A waiver for ADP-II can be submitted by DLA Transaction Services and approved by HQ DLA once the NAC portion of the investigation has been initiated by HQ DLA. Once the investigation and/or waiver have been approved, the billing cycle can begin. SECRET CLEARANCE ­ Contractor personnel working on a classified contract that requires a secret clearance will need to have the investigation process initiated by the company's Facility Security Officer (FSO). An approved DD-254 will be required due to the contract being classified. The DD254 will be coordinated through DLA contracting, DLA Program Manager, DLA Security, Defense Security Services (DSS) and the contracting company. The Contractor is responsible for all costs associated with the secret clearance processes described above and will not be reimbursed by the Government. An electronic version of Standard Form 86 can be obtained from DLA Transaction Services Personnel Security Servicing Office. The Contractor is responsible for all costs associated with the secret clearance processes described above and will not be reimbursed by the Government. The Contractor employees may be required to attend security related training and periodically read security related materiel. DLA Transaction Services retains the right to request removal of Contractor personnel, regardless of prior access, clearance or adjudication status, whose actions, while assigned to this contract, clearly conflict with the interests of the Government. The reason for removal shall be fully documented in writing by the DLA Transaction Services Director. When and if such removal occurs, the Contractor shall within five (5) working days assign qualified personnel to any vacancy thus created. 12.2 Computer Access To perform this work the Contractor requires access to Government-owned computers. To obtain this access for Contractor personnel, the Government Project Manager will submit the required paperwork for the necessary system access. All Contractor personnel provided Government-furnished computer access shall observe local AIS security policies and procedures as provided by the DLA Transaction Services Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO). Violations of local AIS security policy, such as password sharing, performing personal work, file access violations or browsing files outside the scope of the contract, will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may require disciplinary action. Disciplinary action may range from an oral admonishment to removal from the contract. The Contracting Officer shall adjudicate each case and their decision shall be final. The Contractor shall notify the COR, within 24 hours, when for reasons of personnel resignations, reassignments, terminations, or completion of portions of the contract, named Contractor personnel no longer require access to Government computers. 12.3 Software The Contractor shall observe all copyright agreements and shall be held liable for any infringement of copyrighted software licensing agreements and shall compensate the appropriate vendor for each instance of copyright violation. In the interest of protecting Government systems from computer

viruses, the Contractor shall not use public domain software nor shall Contractor personnel download software from public bulletin boards. The Contractor shall use only commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), Contractor-developed, or Government-furnished software in performance of this performance work statement. The Contractor shall use the Microsoft Office suite of software for preparation of all documentation required in the contract. Should the introduction of a computer virus or malicious destruction of computer software, stored information, or hardware result from the use of public domain software or from software taken from a public bulletin board, the Contractor shall be required to repair the damage at no expense to the Government and without impact on delivery schedules or daily operation. 12.4 Information Security Information given to the Contractor during the life of this contract shall only be used for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract. Agency information marked "For Official Use Only" or bearing other sensitivity markings shall be handled in accordance with Agency information security program regulations and shall not be divulged or disclosed without Agency permission. Requests for disclosure shall be addressed to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR). 12.5 Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) To ensure protection of sensitive/proprietary information, all Contractor personnel performing under this contract shall be required to sign a "Non-Disclosure Agreement" (Appendix B). The NDA will be maintained by the COR as a part of the official contract. 12.6 DLA Transaction Services Computer Resource User Agreement "Rules of Behavior" The "Rules of Behavior" are designed to be followed by all users of DLA Transaction Services computer resources. As a requirement of the contract, each contractor employee shall sign and date the "Rules of Behavior" attached to this PWS (Appendix A). The contractor shall provide this document to the DLA Transaction Services ISSO upon reporting for employment at either DLA Transaction Services site. 14.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT 14.1 Work Stations The Government will provide Application Development Workstations (ADW), i.e., personal computers (PCs) for all Contractor personnel assigned to this project.

SECTION L INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS OR RESPONDENTS 1. PROGRAM INFORMATION 1.1 Program Structure and Objectives
DLA Transaction Service's requirement is to perform separate tasks in support of the DLA

Transaction Services Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS), including logistics analysis, reporting, and web application initiatives identified under the DLA Transaction Services DData profile. The Contractor shall be responsible for the Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS) that currently maintains logistics pipeline information for all DOD wholesale items. The Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System/Customer Wait Time (LMARS/CWT) System continues to need development, enhancement and support in order to provide current and additional LMARS/CWT committee reporting requirement and Top 100 (total processing time) drilldown capabilities to enable the DoD Logistics Managers to efficiently and effectively manage their processes. The current LMARS/CWT reporting system provides a set of committee-defined standard reports and drilldowns. The DoD and Joint Staff are requesting more reporting and drilldown capabilities in support of strategic logistics planning goals and objectives. A suite of On Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Reporting module tools are being utilized to meet these demands. This PWS will provide for the professional support to continue to integrate, enhance, maintain and support these tools and to provide sustainment of the existing LMARS/LRT/CWT reporting capability and establish the structure for future reporting requirements. 2. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS a) The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs incurred arising from or in connection with this solicitation. b) The offeror's proposal must include all data and information requested by this Information to Offerors (ITO) and must be submitted in accordance with these instructions. The offer shall be compliant with the requirements as stated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), and Model Contract. Non-conformance with the instructions provided in this ITO may result in an unfavorable proposal evaluation. It is the Government's intent to award without discussions, but the Government reserves the right to ask for clarifying details if necessary. c) The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements but, rather, shall provide Page 1 of 15

convincing rationale to address how the offeror intends to meet these requirements. Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities or experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the offeror's proposal. d) Elaborate brochures or documentation, binding, detailed art work, or other embellishments are unnecessary and are not desired. e) The proposal acceptance period is specified in Section A of the model contract/solicitation. The offeror shall make a clear statement in Section A of the proposal documentation volume that the proposal is valid through this date. f) In accordance with FAR Subpart 4.8 (Government Contract Files), the Government will retain one copy of all unsuccessful proposals. The Government will destroy extra copies of such unsuccessful proposals, unless the offeror requests otherwise within 30 days of contract award. g) The contracting officer has determined that there is a high probability of adequate price competition for this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, no additional data will be requested and certification under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, offerors may be required to submit cost data to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the service. h) Alternate proposals are not permitted for this requirement. The term "alternate proposal" denotes a proposal that offers multiple approaches, or a second, or multiple proposals.

5. Volume III - Past Performance 5.1 Past Performance Information Each offeror shall submit a past performance volume with its proposal, containing past performance information in accordance with the format contained in Section L, Attachment 1, as well as Section L, Table 2.2. This information is required on the offeror and all subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners who are proposed to perform 20 percent or more of the proposed effort based on the total proposed price or perform aspects of the effort the offeror considers critical to overall successful performance. Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each offeror in this volume and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past performance. 5.2 Consent/Authorization Letters Along with the information required in this section, the offeror shall submit a consent letter executed by each subcontractor, teaming partner, and/or joint venture partner, authorizing release of adverse past performance information to the offeror so the offeror can respond to such information. For each identified effort for a commercial customer, the offeror shall also submit a client authorization letter, authorizing release to the Government of requested information on the offeror's performance. 5.3 Early Proposal Information Each offeror is requested to submit the information shown in Section L, Attachment 2 for each relevant contract 7 days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals. Failure to submit early proposal information will not result in offeror disqualification. Page 9 of 15

5.4 Recent and Relevant Contracts Submit information in accordance with Attachment 1: Past Performance Information on 3 recent contracts that you consider most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed within the past three (3) years of the date of issuance of this solicitation. Past performance that fails this condition will not be evaluated. If proposing a teaming arrangement, past performance information must be submitted for each team member or subcontractor performing 20% or more of the effort, for a total of not more that four (4) references. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. For a description of the characteristics or aspects the Government will consider in determining recency and relevance, see Section M, provision M002 - Evaluation Factors, paragraph M002d - Past Performance Factor. 5.4.1 Specific Content Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Merely having problems does not automatically equate to an unacceptable rating, since the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to overcome the problems encountered. The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified. This may allow the offeror to be considered more favorably than without evidence of problem resolution. For example, submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that clearly support that an offeror has overcome past problems is required. Categorize the relevant information into the specific Technical subfactors and Price factor used to evaluate the proposal. 5.4.2 Organizational Structure Change History Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups, subsidiary companies, etc. In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is relevant to this acquisition. To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a "roadmap" describing all such changes in the organization of your company. A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice. As part of this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/performance confidence assessment. Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the offeror(s), your "roadmap" should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the Government receives information from other sources.

6. Volume IV - Price 6.1 General Instructions 6.1.1 Price Reasonableness This section is to assist you in submitting data other than certified cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness and balance of your proposed cost/price. Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your proposal. Note that unrealistically low or high proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal. Additionally, unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror's proposal. Offers should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and balance. The burden of proof for credibility of proposed prices rests with the offeror. 6.1.2 Price Data Data beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your price position. All data relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation, must be included in the section of the proposal designated as the Price volume. Under no circumstances shall this data and documentation be included elsewhere in the proposal. 6.1.3 Cost or Pricing Data Requirements In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing data may be required to support a determination of price reasonableness. Data shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient data available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the offeror shall be required to submit additional cost or pricing data. 6.1.4 Pricing Matrix Offerors shall complete the labor rate/hour matrix (Pricing Matrix) listed as Section L Attachment # 4. The Government estimates $3,500.00 per year are to be used for the Travel CLIN. 6.1.5 Travel A Government provided estimate of travel costs shall be used based on budgetary forecasts. The dollare amount for travel costs will be cost-reimbursable and no profit will be allowed. Travel costs are estimated to be $3,500.00 per year.

Section M ­ Evaluation Factors for Award
1 GENERAL 1.1 Basis for Contract Award This is a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15, Contracting by Negotiation, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), the Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), DoD Source Selection Procedures, Appendix A, 04 March 2011 and Air Force Mandatory Procedures 5315.3. These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FARSite, http://farsite.hill.af.mil. The Government will select the proposal with the lowest evaluated price from among those meeting the acceptability standards for non-price factors. 1.2 Contract(s) may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR Part 9.1, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation factors and subfactors, to represent the lowest price technically acceptable proposal. While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process. 1.3 Number of Contracts to be Awarded The Government intends to award a single contract to perform all of the functions defined in this solicitation; however, the Government reserves the right to award no contract at all, depending on the quality of the proposals submitted or budgetary limitations. 1.4 Correction Potential of Proposals The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency. The judgment of such "correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government. If an aspect of an offeror's proposal does not meet the Government's requirements and is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range. 1.5 Discussions The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision. If the offeror's proposal has been evaluated as Acceptable at the time discussions are closed, any changes or exceptions in the Final Proposal Revision are subject to evaluation and may introduce risk that the offeror's proposal be determined Unacceptable and, thus, ineligible for award.

Solicitation Number: FA8604-15-R-7000 Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS) and Customer Wait Time (CWT) 1.6 Solicitation Requirements, Terms & Conditions Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as factors or subfactors. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in the offeror being ineligible for award. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and must provide complete supporting rationale. The Government reserves the right to determine any such exceptions unacceptable. 2.0 EVALUATION FACTORS 2.1 Evaluation Factors and Subfactors The following evaluation factors and subfactors will be used to evaluate each proposal. The Government will evaluate proposals for acceptability, but will not rank the proposals by the nonprice factors or subfactors. Factor 1: Technical Subfactor 1: IT Support Requirements Subfactor 2: Management Approach Factor 2: Past Performance Factor 3: Price 2.2 Technical Factor The Government's technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical proposals on pass/fail basis, assigning one of the ratings described below for each subfactor. Any subfactor evaluated as "Unacceptable" will render the entire proposal unacceptable and, therefore, unawardable. Only those proposals determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for award. However, the offeror is cautioned that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as received, without discussion. TABLE 1 - TECHNICAL RATINGS Rating Acceptable Unacceptable Description Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

The proposal shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors: Subfactor 1: IT Support Requirements Description: This subfactor will evaluate the Offeror's ability to satisfy the requirements specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Section 3.

Offerors must receive a past performance rating of "Acceptable" to be eligible for award. 2.3.1 Ratings. The Past Performance factor will receive one of the ratings described below. TABLE 2- PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION RATINGS Rating Acceptable Description Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.) Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.

Unacceptable

Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable." 2.3.2 Evaluation Process. The past performance evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet the solicitation requirements. In conducting the Past Performance evaluation, the Government reserves the right to use both the information provided in the offeror's Past Performance proposal volume and information obtained from other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to: the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS); Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS); Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; and interviews/questionnaires with Program Managers, Contracting Officers and Fee Determining Officials, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and commercial sources. 2.3.2.1 Recency Assessment

Page 4 of 7

Solicitation Number: FA8604-15-R-7000 Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS) and Customer Wait Time (CWT) An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated. 2.3.2.2 Relevancy Assessment The Government will conduct an evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine whether the products provided/services performed under those contracts relate to the Technical subfactors. For each recent past performance citation reviewed, the relevance of the work performed will generally be assessed for the Technical subfactors (however, all aspects of performance that relate to this acquisition may be considered). Consideration will be given to relevant present/past performance effort involved with similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. A relevancy determination of the offeror's past performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations, including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s). In determining the relevancy of effort performed under individual past performance contracts, the government will only consider the specific effort or portion consistent with that proposed by the prime, subcontractor or teaming partner. The past performance information forms (PIFs) and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance. The Government will use the following relevancy definitions when assessing recent, relevant contracts:

TABLE 3 ­ PAST PERFORMANCE RELEVANCY RATINGS Rating RELEVANT Definition Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.

NOT RELEVANT

2.3.2.3 Performance Quality Assessment The Government will consider the performance quality of recent, relevant efforts (how well the contractor performed on the contracts). For each recent, relevant past performance citation reviewed, the performance quality of the work performed will be assessed for the Technical subfactors (however, all aspects of performance that relate to this acquisition may be considered). Pursuant to DFARS 215.304(c)(i), the assessment will also consider the extent to which the offeror's evaluated past performance demonstrates compliance with FAR 52.2198, Utilization of Small Business Concerns and FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan. The quality assessment may result in positive or adverse findings. Adverse is defined as past performance information that supports an

Page 5 of 7

Solicitation Number: FA8604-15-R-7000 Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS) and Customer Wait Time (CWT) unsatisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system. For adverse information identified, the evaluation will consider the number and severity of the problem(s), mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of corrective actions that have resulted in sustained improvements. Process changes will only be considered when objectively measurable improvements in performance have been demonstrated. The Government will use the following quality levels when assessing recent, relevant efforts: TABLE 4 ­ PAST PERFORMANCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT Quality Assessment/Color Description SATISFACTORY (S)/GREEN During the contract period, contractor performance is substantially meeting (or substantially met) all contract requirements. For any problems encountered, contractor took effective corrective action. UNSATISFACTORY(U)/RED During the contract period, contractor performance is not meeting (or did not meet) some contract requirements. For problems encountered, corrective action appeared only marginally effective, not effective, or not fully implemented. Customer involvement was required. NOT AVAILABLE(N)/WHITE Quality and/or performance information is not available.

2.3.3 Assigning Ratings. As a result of the relevancy and performance quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated past performance rating at the factor level (see Table 2). More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Past Performance rating than less recent or relevant effort. 2.4 Price Factor Price proposals will be evaluated for (1) completeness, (2) reasonableness, (3) unbalanced pricing, and (4) Total Evaluated Price. Offerors whose price is determined to be incomplete, unreasonable or unbalanced may not be considered for award. 2.4.1 Completeness. The Government will review the pricing submissions for all information submitted as instructed in Section L, in the prescribed format, and error free and in compliance with Section L of the solicitation. 2.4.2 Reasonableness: The offeror's Price proposal will be evaluated, using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable. For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay in the conduct of competitive business. Normally, price reasonableness is established through price analysis techniques as described in FAR 15.404. For additional information see FAR 31.201-3.

Solicitation Number: FA8604-15-R-7000 Logistics Metrics Analysis Reporting System (LMARS) and Customer Wait Time (CWT) 2.4.3 Unbalanced Pricing: The Government will analyze each proposal to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to prices in accordance with FAR 15.404-1. An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. 2.4.4 Total Evaluated Price (TEP): The TEP will be evaluated using the attached Pricing Matrix to be filled out be each offeror. The sum of all labor categories and the not-to-exceed travel amount will determine the price for each period. The TEP is the sum of the basic period plus all option periods including the six-month option to extension of services in accordance with FAR 52.217-8. TEP will be used for evaluation purposes only; evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options. 2.4.5 Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options. 3 PRE-AWARD SURVEY The Government may conduct a pre-award survey (PAS) as part of this source selection. Results of the PAS (if conducted) will be evaluated to determine each offeror's capability to meet the requirements of the solicitation.

If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Labor Standards statute -- (1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Labor Standards clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or (2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis. (c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision -- (1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Certain Services--Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and (2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation. (d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.
