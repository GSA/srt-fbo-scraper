 STATEMENT OF WORK ABS/MBS DATA SUBSCRIPTION ACQUISITION

1.0 Background

In furtherance ofthe OFS mission to provide stability and prevent disruption to the U.S. financial markets, and to implement the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of2008 (the Act), the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) was established to restore liquidity and stability to the financial system ofthe United States. Specific assets acquired toward that end for the portfolio include: a) equity investments in various entities; b) debt obligations and loans to various entities; c) guarantees to certain financial organizations; and d) programs to mitigate foreclosures. In addition, to promote market stability, OFS may decide to include other types of asset backed securities and other obligations in its portfolio. Consistent with the Act, the Treasury's policy goals for the portfolio of troubled mortgage related assets are to: a) provide stability and prevent further disruption to the financial markets and banking system; b) ensure mortgage availability; c) protect the interests of taxpayers; and d) promote transparency. The portfolio mandate and specific investment strategies may change over time but will remain consistent with these policy goals. By acquiring, managing, and orderly liquidating the troubled assets, the Treasury seeks to improve the capital positions of financial institutions; reduce risk premiums in the market; improve liquidity and credit extension in the financial system; increase investor confidence; and, provide market participants with more price transparency.

2.0

Description of Service Need

The Department of the Treasury's Office of Financial Stability and other offices within Treasury's Departmental Offices requires: a) a subscription to data sources (i.e., libraries) for Asset Backed Securities (ABS) and Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) which allow Treasury to generate cash flows for securities held by Treasury, and includes services related to updating the Offeror's existing data libraries (i.e., a library is a database used by a cash flow model) to incorporate additional securities held by Treasury during the performance period; b) documentation and support for all data, processes, and models related to the data libraries; c) licenses to use the Offeror's Commercial Off-the-Shelf(COTS) Application to access the data libraries; and d) training on how to use the Offeror's COTS' application. The services are necessary in order for Treasury to complete a fair and effective valuation of investments in Special Purchased Vehicles (SPV), and allow Treasury to project future cash flows ofthe securities purchased by the SPVs. The valuations ofthe Treasury investments in the SPVs are required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). 2.1 2.1.1 Requirements Subscription to Data Libraries Page 15

Solicitation Number TOFS-ll-S-0013

The subscription must include data libraries of structured finance deals comprising U.S. originated Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS), Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS), and Asset Backed Securities (ABS). The subscription to the data libraries must include: a) Cash Flow Modeling Engines; b) Integrated Offeror provided Performance Assumptions; and c) Historical and Surveillance Data. Sections 2.1.1.1-2.1.1.6 contains detailed requirements for the data libraries. The Offeror must have industry experience with: a) gathering data typically available from loan securitizers, servicers, and nationally recognized credit rating agencies; b) creating financial cash flow and performance models integrated with the data sources for various structured financial deals; and c) making the information readily available to its subscribers in an easy to retrieve format and means using a COTS Application. The data libraries, which are listed in Section 2.1.1.5 item 6, shall contain data and cash flow models that can be used to generate cash flows for securities held by Treasury related to, but not limited to, its' Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The subscription to the data libraries shall allow Treasury the capability to run cash flow scenarios and cash flow stress tests on its portfolios based on user provided and Offeror provided performance assumptions; and shall provide Treasury with historical performance and surveillance information for analysis purposes to calculate the value of Treasury investments in SPVs that are part ofthe Term Asset-Backed Security Loan Facility (TALF) and Public Private Investment Program (PPIP) per the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA). The subscription access must fully meet the requirements specifically outlined below in the following subsections. 2.1.1.1 Cash Flow Modeling Engines The Cash Flow Modeling Engines must allow Treasury to:

1. Produce, view, and export CUSIP cash flows for individual CUSIPs or for entire
 portfolios.

2. Access all existing available data libraries, and all Treasury held structured finance deals in the data libraries specified in the Section 2.1.1.5 item 6.

3. Control model inputs and assumptions such as prepayments, defaults, loss/recovery rates, delinquency rates, interest rates, etc.
4. Run analysis for individual deals and for Treasury defined portfolios.

5. Store user defined assumptions, portfolio of deals, etc. to allow the cash flow models to be run in an automated manner. In addition, all structural features of the deals must be accurately modeled, including split-loan structures, loss allocations, triggers, prepayment penalty allocations, and interest-rate hedges. The Cash Flow Modeling Engines must: Solicitation Number TOFS-11-S-0013 Page 16

1. Import comprehensive portfolio of deals. 2. Apply Offeror or Treasury provided performance assumptions for each scenario,
 including all historical sets of scenarios provided to Treasury.


3. Import deal level vector assumptions for multiple scenarios. Given an imported portfolio
of deals, the financial model must be able to handle multiple scenarios for each deal. For each scenario, the user must be able to specify deal level assumptions such as prepayments, defaults, loss/recovery rates, delinquency rates, interest rates, etc.

4. Create projected CUSIP level cash flows (monthly time series) based on the imported
portfolio of deals. 5. Export the output cash flow projections to a single text file. Cash flow projection files must include the fields CUSIP, month, a scenario identifier, balance, principal, interest, and write downs/losses.

6. Export the macro economic variables, if applicable, underlying each scenario to a single

SECTION 9
 EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


Addendum to 52.212-2, EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999): CRITERIA FOR CONTRACT AWARD:
(a) Basis for Award. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to this RFP, is determined to be the best overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Offeror should show that the objectives stated in this RFP are understood and offer a logical approach to their achievement. The evaluation shall be conducted in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated below. The Government intends to award a contract on the basis of initial offerors received, without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the government reserves the right to enter discussions where it has determined that discussions are appropriate to: (l) have offerors make material changes to its proposal, (2) and/or establish a competitive range.

(b) The Government will perform a trade-off analysis of non-price factors against price to determine the best value to the Government. A response to this solicitation that receives a significant weakness or deficiency may result in a rating of marginal or unacceptable, which may permit a response not to be considered for award.
(c) Relative weight. Non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.

(ii) Examples.

Д6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Д6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.
