SECTION I: STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)
CORPORATE BOND CHARACTERISTICS DATA
1. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this contract is to obtain data on corporate bond characteristics to be used for the HQM Corporate Bond Yield Curve and related yield curves. The contractor must provide continuous access to these characteristics data for substantially all bonds in the entire U.S. market for investment grade corporate bonds. 2. BACKGROUND The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) mandates that the Treasury Department produce a corporate bond yield curve. This yield curve is called the High Quality Market (HQM) Corporate Bond Yield Curve. The HQM yield curve pertains to corporate bonds in the top three qualities AAA, AA, and A. Additional related yield curves using the same methodology are also computed in conjunction with the HQM curve. In order to produce these curves, the Office of Economic Policy buys appropriate data and licenses. The required data include characteristics data for substantially all bonds in the entire U.S. investment grade corporate bond market. Such data are purchased from one or more data providers. 3. SCOPE The objective of this contract is to obtain data on bond characteristics for substantially the entire U.S. market for investment grade corporate bonds. These data are to be used for the HQM Corporate Bond Yield Curve and related yield curves. 4. SPECIFIC TASKS Task 1: Provide data on corporate bond characteristics for substantially every bond in the entire U.S. investment grade corporate bond market. This task is specified in Section 5. 5. CHARACTERISTICS DATA 5.1. The contractor must provide characteristics data at any time and for every day during the Period of Performance specified in Section 7. The specific characteristics data items are described below. At any time, the group of bonds for which characteristics data are available to be provided must substantially cover the entire U.S. investment grade corporate bond market at that time. 5.2. The Group of Bonds 5.2.1. The group of bonds for which characteristics data are available from the contractor at any time must include substantially all bonds in the entire U.S. investment grade corporate bond market that exist or could be traded at that time. The number of bonds in this group is in the thousands, since small

A13-066

Page 1 of 39

samples of bonds are not sufficient to reflect the market. This implies that the group of bonds for which data are available will change over time as the bonds in the market change. The contractor must describe in detail the methodology employed for selecting the group of bonds. 5.2.2. In addition to bonds in the market at any time, the contractor must also provide historical characteristics data for bonds that have matured or expired. For any previous point in time, all bonds that were included in the characteristics data at that time must be included in the historical data. At any time, the historical data must go back at least one year; the contractor must document how far back characteristics data are available. 5.2.3. For this contract, a corporate bond is defined to be a debt security issued by a corporation, U.S. or foreign, denominated in dollars and trading in the United States, with maturity at issue of greater than one year. Corporate bonds include medium term notes, long-term CDs, and equipment trusts, and include listed bonds and over-the-counter bonds. If the contractor supplies a set of characteristics data that also has non-corporate bonds, the contractor must provide indications as to which bonds are corporate and which are not. 5.2.4. Also for this contract, an investment grade bond is defined to be a bond rated by either Moody's or S&P or both, and given a rating of Baa3 or higher if rated by Moody's or BBB- or higher if rated by S&P. 5.2.5. Because the yield curve computations using the characteristics data from the contractor may be distributed to the public, the contractor's terms of use of these data must allow for public distribution. 5.3. Characteristics Data Items 5.3.1. The characteristics data items must include items that help select bonds for the yield curves. Therefore, the characteristics data must provide enough information to determine whether each bond is the type of bond that is used in the yield curves. In general, the yield curves currently use bonds that have similar characteristics to Treasury coupon issues, including fixed semiannual coupons and a fixed maturity date. However, the types of bonds used in the curves could change in the future, and the characteristics data items must allow for this. In addition to choosing bonds for the curves, the characteristics data are also used in the construction of the curves. 5.3.2. All bonds for which data are provided by the contractor must be identified by CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) number, either eight or nine characters. The CUSIP numbers must be officially assigned by the CUSIP bureau when such assignments exist; if an official CUSIP number is not available and another number is substituted (such as a CUSIP number assigned internally by the contractor), there must be an indicator that the number is not official. 5.3.3. Characteristics data items must be provided that indicate whether each security is a corporate bond (versus asset backed or some other type of security). The issuer of the bond must be provided, the country of incorporation of the issuer, and the currency of the bond. The data items must include items that describe the market and the industry of the bond.

A13-066

Page 2 of 39

5.3.4. Characteristics items must be provided that describe the coupon of each bond. The items must indicate whether the bond has a fixed coupon, or whether the bond has a zero coupon, or whether the coupon can change and whether the bond has a floating or variable coupon, or whether the coupon is adjustable. The items must indicate whether the coupon is semiannual or paid at some other interval, and whether the bond is payment-in-kind. Moreover, the items must indicate whether the coupon is inflation-indexed or affected by any other index or other data, and whether the coupon payments are performance sensitive. 5.3.5. Characteristics data items must be provided that describe the maturity of each bond. The items must indicate whether the bond has a fixed unchanging maturity, or whether the maturity of the bond may change, whether the bond is extendible, or is perpetual. The data items must indicate the amount of the bond to be redeemed at maturity. Also, data items must indicate whether the amount redeemed at maturity is inflation-indexed. 5.3.6. Characteristics data items must also be provided that describe any embedded options in each bond. Items must indicate whether the bond has a call option, a put option, or a sinking fund, and must describe the features of these options if any are present. In particular, the characteristics items must indicate whether any call option is make whole, and whether the bond has a call schedule, and must describe the features of any such call schedule. 5.3.7. Characteristics data items must be provided that indicate whether each bond is a medium term note, whether it is a CD, and whether it is a private placement. The items must indicate whether the bond is convertible or reverse convertible, whether the bond is a structured note or has any synthetic features, whether it is exchangeable, whether it has warrants attached, whether it has an original issue discount, and whether it is credit-linked. And items must indicate whether the bond is a capital security or any other type of hybrid security. 5.3.8. The characteristics data items must provide additional information for computing the yield curves, including each bond's coupon rate, issue date, issue amount, dated date, date of the first coupon payment, maturity date, and day count convention, and must provide sufficient information to derive the dates of the coupon payments of the bond. The data items must indicate whether each bond's price is quoted as a percent of par. 5.3.9. The contractor may also provide additional data items describing other features of each bond that may affect its price. Additional data items showing more detail for embedded options may be included. 6. DELIVERABLES AND DELIVERY SCHEDULE 6.1. The characteristic data must be available at any time of day for all days in the Period of Performance specified in Section 7 including weekends and holidays. 6.2. The contractor must propose the method of delivery of the characteristics data to Treasury, but the method should be easy to use, fully documented, and permit rapid and repeated queries by Treasury for

A13-066

Page 3 of 39

characteristics data on bonds identified by CUSIP numbers. Most queries by Treasury for characteristics data should typically receive the requested data within a few minutes. 6.3. The characteristics data must be provided to Treasury in the form of one or more electronic text files that are in a human readable format. One acceptable method of delivery is for Treasury to upload by File Transfer Protocol (FTP) a text file with CUSIP numbers and a list of characteristics data items to the contractor, with the contractor responding with a file containing the CUSIP numbers and characteristics items and providing it for FTP download. 7. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE The Period of Performance for this contract is September 28, 2013 through September 27, 2014, with four Option Years. 8. SUPPORT 8.1. The contractor must provide support in resolving any problems or questions in connection with the supplied characteristics data. Problems might include, but may not be limited to, missing or erroneous data or information. Questions could arise with regard to individual characteristics items or sets of data that may be anomalous, and the contractor must be able to answer the questions and explain the anomalies. 8.2. As part of the support, the contractor must provide complete documentation about the data supplied, including definitions of characteristics items and the technical layout of all data files. 8.3. The contractor's support must include a telephone number that is available to be called for help every business day between 9 a.m. ET and 6 p.m. ET. Any problem or question must be resolved and any replacement or corrected data must be received by Treasury within 48 hours from the time that the telephone call was placed alerting the contractor to the problem or question or need for replacement or correction. 9. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE 9.1. The purpose of the data supplied by the contractor from this contract is to construct the yield curves described above. Therefore, all provided data must be accurate and complete for producing the HQM yield curve and related curves. 9.2. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will perform inspection to ensure that the provided data fulfill all requirements of this Statement of Work. 9.3. Treasury will make best efforts to work toward resolution of any problem or question as quickly as possible, so that the resulting data can be accepted.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and A13-066 Page 17 of 39

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed end products.

D. EVALUATION CRITERIA
D.1 Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance: (i) technical ability of the offeror to meet the Government requirement; (ii) past performance; and (iii) price. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The following criteria will be used in the evaluation to assess and document the extent to which a proposal meets, fails to meet, or usefully exceeds the minimum requirements contained in Statement of Work of this RFP. The Ability to Perform Contract Requirements is of greatest importance. The proposal will be evaluated based upon the offeror's response to the technical evaluation criteria, and will be assigned ratings of Highly Acceptable, Acceptable, Marginally Acceptable, and Unacceptable. Your proposal will be evaluated by the "best value" methodology. The Government shall evaluate quotes for (a) technical approach, (b) past performance, and (c) price. The Government shall separately evaluate the non-price factors of technical merit and past performance from price. Price shall not be point rated. Technical approach is more important than past performance, and both combined are significantly more important than price. Your response to this RFP shall become part of the official contract file. 1. TECHNICAL APPROACH / ABILITY TO PERFORM CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS 1.1. The proposal should address each requirement in the Statement of Work in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear and firm understanding of the requirement.

A13-066

Page 37 of 39

1.2. The offeror should provide evidence to show that each requirement will be accomplished. 1.3. The Government will evaluate the clarity, feasibility, completeness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy of the offeror's proposal to accomplish each requirement. The evaluation will include the following: 1.3.1. The Government will evaluate the offeror's described method, processes, and procedures for the provision of corporate bond characteristics data to Treasury as specified in the Statement of Work. Also, the Government will examine and evaluate any data or statistics or other information provided by the offeror for validating the accuracy of the characteristics data, and for ensuring that the data provided by the offeror cover the market. 1.3.2. The Government will evaluate the offeror's described approach, processes and procedures for support including helpdesk support. 1.3.3. The Government will evaluate the offeror's data submitted for the trial period and any other data submitted in accord with Section IV, C. 1.3.3.1. The trial data must demonstrate that the offeror's characteristics data cover the market. In particular, there must be enough investment grade corporate bonds included in the characteristics data as shown during the trial period to cover the market. On average, there should be roughly 20,000 investment grade corporate bonds or more at any time. Of course, the offeror may include other securities too if they are offering a database that has more securities, but the corporate bonds should be indicated in the database. 1.3.3.2. In addition, there must be enough corporate bonds in the characteristics data of the types that can be used in the HQM yield curve and related curves using current methodology. In particular, the trial period must demonstrate that the characteristics data contain a sufficient number of corporate bonds issued by U.S. corporations that have the same features as conventional Treasury notes and bonds, that is, corporate bonds with a fixed semiannual nominal coupon and a fixed maturity, without any embedded options (except possibly for a make whole call provision), and with no other special features. The number of such bonds in the characteristics data with par amount outstanding of $250 million or more and rated A3 or above by Moody's and A- or above by S&P must be at least around 1,650. Similarly, the number of such bonds in the characteristics data with par amount outstanding of $250 million or more and rated Baa3, Baa2, or Baa1 by Moody's and BBB-, BBB, or BBB+ by S&P must be at least around 1,450. 1.3.3.3. During the trial period, the characteristics data will also be evaluated for completeness and accuracy by comparing the data with other relevant bond market data. 1.4. The Government will evaluate, based on the resumes and staffing support plan specifically included in the proposal, the qualifications and experience of the proposed Project Director with respect to bond analysis. The evaluation will consider whether the resume and other information indicate sufficient experience and skill in comparable activities.

2. PAST PERFORMANCE 2.1. The offeror's past performance will be evaluated on the basis of similarity to the requirements of this RFP in subject matter, size, scope, complexity, and the quality of performance of past work. 2.2. The quality of the offeror's past performance will be evaluated on the basis of information contained in this proposal and the information that the Government obtains through reference checks and/or from other sources. 2.3. The Government's past performance evaluation will assess the offeror's record of how well the offeror did on work for government and private sector clients. The extent to which the offeror supplies examples of accomplishments will be assessed. 3. PRICE EVALUATION 3.1. The Government will evaluate the offeror's price proposals to determine reasonableness, realism and performance risk for the pricing of the required work outlined in this RFP. 3.2. The evaluation of technical and cost proposals will include the Period of Performance September 28, 2013 through September 27, 2014, and four Option Years. BASIS FOR AWARD The award shall be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government based on the stated evaluation factors and sub-factor. The selection of a contractor under this RFP will be at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer. Best value is defined as the most advantageous proposal for the Government that is reached through an assessment and trade-off analysis among evaluation factors, potential risk, and overall price. As such, the Government reserves the right to pay a premium for a technically superior offer. This RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for preparation and submission of your proposal. In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this proposed acquisition. Any resultant contract shall include all applicable clauses to the type of contract awarded. Any additional clauses required by public law, executive order, or acquisition regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.
