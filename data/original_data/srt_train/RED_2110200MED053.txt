The contractor will provide/install a ceiling-recessed 100-inch motorized screen on the north wall. Audio Equipment: Contractor to provide and install an amplifier and overhead speakers that will allow personnel in the room to hear audio from laptop content/projector content clearly throughout the room. The system should be capable of volume modification/control. Also, the contractor is to install another set of connected speakers into the small adjoining training room (Room #101), so that the audio can be heard in there as well when the movable wall separating the rooms is collapsed and the two rooms are effectively one larger training room. A "kill switch" or similar method will have to be installed so that sound content is not broadcast into the speakers in #101 when the rooms are separated by the retractable wall. Source/Switching/Control Equipment: Contractor to provide wiring/wall plates such that the projector can receive/display input from a laptop computer/DVD player connected via a connection port built in to the wall near the northeast corner of the room.

Large Classroom (Room #103) Display Equipment: Contractor to install a client-furnished projector/universal mount that will project to the west wall. The contractor will provide/install a ceiling-recessed 100-inch motorized screen on the west wall. Audio Equipment: Contractor to provide and install an amplifier and overhead speakers that will allow personnel in the room to hear audio from laptop content/projector content clearly throughout the room. The system should be capable of volume modification/control. Source/Switching/Control Equipment: Contractor to provide wiring/wall plates such that the projector can receive/display input from a laptop computer/DVD player connected via a connection port built in to the wall near the northwest corner of the room.
