 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, Streamlined Procedures for
Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement
constitutes the only solicitation; Firm Fixed-Priced quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The
solicitation number is NAMA-NW-11-Q-0009 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions
and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-47 effective December 13, 2010.  This is an unrestricted acquisition,
issued in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
intends to issue a purchase order(s) with firm fixed-priced contract line items (CLINs).  EVALUATION: This is an unrestricted procurement,
subject to Full and Open Competition.  The Government reserves the right to issue multiple purchase orders, as well as, award on the initial
quote without discussions of this procurement.  Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR 13.5 in conjunction with
Subpart 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation and in accordance with the guidance at FAR
12.301(c)(2).  A purchase order will be issued to the Contractor(s) whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous
to the Government.  Best value for this procurement will be obtained through a lowest price technically acceptable evaluation.  For evaluation
purposes, the firm-fixed price for each CLIN will be determined by multiplying the Unit Price by the Quantity of units, and the total fixed
price will be determined by summing the firm-fixed price of all CLINs.  Contractors must provide pricing for each CLIN, including any Option
CLINs.  The Government will only accept commercial-off-the-shelf items.  Section 508 Evaluation Factors- Responses to this solicitation will
only be considered for receipt of the purchase order(s) after it has been determined that the quotation adequately addresses the requirements
for Section 508.  Only quotations which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a
completed Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT), VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any
additional merit consideration.  If the deliverable proposed in response to this solicitation includes features and functions in addition to
those identified as requirements, these features and functions also need to conform to relevant Section 508 technical provisions, functional
performance criteria, and information, documentation and support.  The accessibility of these additional features and functions should be
described in the completed GPAT.  In order to facilitate a comprehensive Government evaluation, contractors quoting “Or Equal” products are
required to submit itemized technical specifications for CLINs 0001 and 0002 that address each enumerated requirement of Attachment 3,
Specifications.  BACKGROUND: The purpose of this procurement is to purchase Integrated Digital Microfilm Scanners with Workstations for the
Customer Services Division (NWCC) of the Access Program of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  Acquiring integrated
Digital Microfilm Scanners with Workstations will allow NWCC to upgrade the services it offers the research community at the Archives I facility
in Washington, D.C.  NARA has more than 300,000 rolls of microfilmed copies of records, most of which to-date have never been digitized.  This
integrated 12-person digital microfilm scanner system will allow public researchers access to the technology and the non-digitized microfilm in
one location.  This system will afford researchers the option to scan the microfilm, and save the images in a variety of formats and resolutions
on removable media, such as DVDs and thumb drives, or scan and print using the large paper laser printers.  REQUIREMENTS: F.O.B. Destination
pricing is requested for each CLIN, all delivery costs must be included in total firm fixed price.  See Attachment 1, Schedule of Prices.
Contractors must submit their pricing in accordance with RFQ Attachment 1, Schedule of Prices.  See Attachment 3, Specifications for

It is the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure that NARA is not provided either counterfeit or grey market products.  In the event that such IT
products are determined to be counterfeit or grey market, NARA will seek all available legal remedies including criminal prosecution.
Counterfeit information technology product means any item of information technology (IT), including hardware and software that is an
unauthorized copy, replica, or substitute.  A grey market item is an item that is original equipment manufacturer (OEM); however, the
manufacturer did not intend for it to be sold in the USA.  As a result manufacturers will not honor associated warranties and service
agreements.  Unless you, the Contractor, are authorized by the manufacturer to resell the particular items you are quoting in the USA, it is in
your best interest as well as the Government’s that you simply do not respond.  NARA will verify with the manufacturers immediately upon order
issuance that the Contractor is an authorized reseller for this buy.  Any issues with the information provided by the manufacturer to the
Government about the grey market status of the items must be addressed by the Contractor to the manufacturer.  The Government will immediately
cancel any order based on a quotation of grey market items.  In an effort to further ensure NARA is receiving new, manufacturer approved OEM
items and will receive the benefits of any warranties or other manufacturer guarantees, NARA requires contractors to submit with their quote
proof in writing from the OEM manufacturer of their status as an authorized/certified OEM Contractor of the manufactured items.  Contractors
must complete and return Attachment 2, Required Quote Information, and the Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT), in order
for their quotations to be considered.  QUESTIONS: Questions regarding this RFQ must be submitted in writing to Ms. Cynthia Jones no later than
12:00 PM EST on March 29, 2011. Questions submitted in any other manner will not be answered.  The Government will answer questions or requests
for clarification via a written RFQ amendment.  SUBMISSION OF QUOTATIONS:  Three (3) copies of each quotation should be mailed to National
Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Attention: Ms. Cynthia Jones (NAMA-NW-11-Q-0009), 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 3400, College Park, MD
20740-6001 or e-mailed to: cynthia.jones@nara.gov.  Quotations should be received by 4:00 PM ET on April 6, 2011.  Failure to submit quotations
by the due date may result in rejection of the quotation as untimely.  Contractors submitting via e-mail are cautioned to allow one extra
business day for delivery and confirm receipt of quotation as the e-mail will need to pass through IT security.  The following Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant fixed price contract, with the exception
of FAR provisions which will be removed prior to issuance of the order: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jun 2008);

                                      Integrated Digital Microfilm Scanner with Workstations for Public Use

1.0   INTRODUCTION

The Customer Services Division (NWCC) of the Access Program of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is upgrading the services
it offers the research community at the Archives I facility (Washington, DC), by acquiring integrated digital microfilm scanners with
workstations comprised of the following:

      1.1 Microfilm digital scanner, Quantity: 12;

      1.2 24-inch Flat-screen LCD Color Computer Monitor, Quantity: 12;

      1.3 Black and White Laser Printer, Quantity: 2; and

      1.4 System Maintenance and Support

NARA has more than 300,000 rolls of microfilmed copies of records, most of which to-date have never been digitized.  This integrated 12-person
digital microfilm scanner system will allow public researchers access to the technology and the non-digitized microfilm in one location.  This
system will afford researchers the option to scan the microfilm, and save the images in a variety of formats and resolutions on removable media,
such as DVDs and thumb drives, or scan and print using the large paper laser printers.
