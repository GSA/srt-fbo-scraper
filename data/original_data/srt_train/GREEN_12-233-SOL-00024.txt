Functional & technical systems support of the PSC's Revenue Invoicing and Cost Estimation System (PRICES), the PRICES On-Line Viewer, the Fee-for-service Application for Monthly Planning (FAMP), and the Fee-For-Service Spreadsheet II (FFSS2). C.2. BACKGROUND

PSC cost centers are responsible for providing the various PSC goods and services to their customers. These cost centers are located within the PSC service organizations and use PRICES to bill, record, track, and report data for the services that PSC performs under the Service and Supply Fund. Each cost center is responsible for managing the reimbursable and fee-for-service activities associated with the goods and services they provide. In managing its activities, the cost centers perform the following functions:    Formulate and execute the budgets Develop cost model and determine the competitive rate-setting/price of services necessary to recoup costs Establish the Service Level Agreements (SLA) with customers to reflect the type, quantity, total value and performance standards in fulfilling customer orders. Track actual activity to agreement and continuously report/inform customers of those levels Generate customer bills that contain sufficient detail information Ensure timely collection of funds and proper crediting in UFMS accounts receivable subsidiary ledgers Figure 1 shows the current information and accounting transaction flows associated with these activities.

"Cost of  Goods Sold"

While PSC cost centers manage the reimbursable activities, PSC customers are also involved from a budgeting, procurement, and payment perspective. Prior to offering a good or service, the applicable PSC cost center must establish a cost object which represents the good or service and determine a price. The price is based on historical cost information and budget authority associated with the good or service. Once PSC establishes the cost objects and obtains and records the associated budget authority for providing the goods and services, it begins to accumulate the actual costs associated with delivering goods and services. Costs are linked to both cost objects and cost centers for reporting and analysis purposes. Upon determination of a need, PSC customers will request budget authority to acquire goods and services. Once they received this budget authority, the customers will request the goods and services from the applicable PSC cost center. Once customers request goods and services, the cost center establishes the SLAs with customers which define the terms and conditions, establish the price, sets performance standards and specify the customer's payment method. The SLA may contain multiple goods and services (cost objects) with multiple pricing methods. For example, one price may be based on a fixed-fee basis while another price is based on a rate of per number of units.

Once goods or services are acquired, customers will establish commitments. The customers will establish obligations for these goods and services at the time of acquisition or the time of fulfillment based on the terms of their agreement with the applicable PSC cost center. Customer budget allocation, commitment, and obligation accounting activities are outside PSC's control and do not have a direct bearing on PSC cost management analysis and reporting; however, for PSC-serviced agencies, PSC seeks to ensure that the funds are obligated and even linked to the SLA to facilitate the collection process. Once the cost centers fulfill customer orders by providing the goods and services, they bill the customer. Customers have the opportunity to review the bills and accept or dispute them. Once the customer accepts the bills, funds are collected via a variety of methods, such as credit card, Intra-governmental Payment and Collections (IPAC) and direct obligation transfer. All revenue and costs are tracked by cost object and cost center, allowing the PSC cost centers to determine levels of goods and services provided, cost center profitability, refine pricing, and prepare future year budgets using cost reporting capabilities. Billings and collections are tracked by SLA, which allow PSC cost centers and its customers to view expended and available balances by cost object. PSC currently relies on a number of systems to manage and account for its reimbursable and feefor-service activities as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Current System Flow

Functional & technical systems support of the PSC's Revenue Invoicing and Cost Estimation System (PRICES)

PRICES is managed and maintained by the Information System Management Service (ISMS) and supported by the PSC FMS Business and Billing Office. PRICES is the primary system used by the PSC to record customer agreement terms, prepare & deliver customer invoices and report on reimbursable activities. At the same time, many of the cost centers have their own systems that they use to manage customers and customer agreements, record order fulfillment, and determine payment methods and prices. These 9 systems currently interface with PRICES to provide SLA terms and billing and customer payment transactions. Currently, both external and internal PSC customers can access their bills through the PRICES On-Line Viewer. The use and purpose of the systems shown in Figure 2 is briefly explained below:  PRICES was created with Power Builder. It contains products and services that are available to the customer agencies on a fee-for-service basis. The fee is derived based on the product line/service type rate table as well as the PSC employee's pay rates. The labor and non-labor rates are combined and stored on a rate table. This table is used during the budgeting/costing formulation of SLA's. The PSC uses historical data during their budgeting process for each its HHS Operating Division customer. The budget, once it has been approved by the SSF Board, covers the costs associated to providing the requested services. Upon the receipt of the signed SLA, the PSC provides detail contact lists for the Operating Divisions to call in the services or they are performed routinely based on established workflow. Once the PSC invoices for the services, it becomes an actual cost. Fee-For-Service Spreadsheet II (FFSS2)--PSC uses FFSS2 to formulate its budget and determine costs and set rates for PSC's goods and services. FFSS2 results are manually input into PRICES as well as monthly and yearly budget plans. Fee-for-service Application for Monthly Planning (FAMP)--PSC has developed FAMP, a new system not yet in operation, to assist in the preparation of spending plans as well as determining costs and rates. Since this system is not operational, the executed budget devised from the spending plan is manually entered into PRICES. Unified Financial Management System (UFMS)--is the PSC's official financial system of record. The PRICES/UFMS interface allows for accounts receivable transactions to flow from PRICES to UFMS and for PSC cost center obligations, expenditures and expense transactions (actual PSC costs associated with providing goods and services) to flow from UFMS to PRICES. PRICES also sends billing information to IPAC for intragovernment funds collection. UFMS is used to record all of the budget execution (from FFSS2), funds distribution (from iProcurement), and receivable management (from PRICES) accounting events. UFMS is also used to record customer collections and make payments. PRICES Online Viewer is the web portal that PSC customers login to for viewing of their monthly bills. The invoices are created in PRICES and can be viewed by the customer on the Online Viewer once saved. Invoices are shown as draft until they are finalized during the month end closeout process.

There are nine feeder systems which transmit invoice data to the PRICES system. That data is processed into PRICES using an automated interface. The nine systems are:          MITTS ­ Printing Procurement PRISM ­ The Strategic Acquisition Service System RMRC ­ Rocky Mountain Regional CASU STM ­ The Automated External Defibrillator program TRANSHARE ­ The PSC Transhare Program System ELITE ­ The Supply Service Center System BITS ­ The Division of Security and Emergency Services System NYC ­ New York CASU ITIO ­ The Office of Information Technology Infrastructure and Operations System

At present, the interfaces between PRICES and other systems are manual to the extent that a user must manually trigger a process to generate or import a file. In many instances users must also manipulate the data before it can be loaded into the receiving system. Information between PRICES and UFMS is tied through HHS's Common Accounting Number (CAN) and UFMS's Budget Accounting Classification Structure (BAC). The following technical information is provided for reference: Average invoice count per year Cost Centers (PSC, OS & HR) Number of Customers Internal to HHS External to HHS Average System Issue fixes per year Completed In Progress 104,000 97 4,634 3,399 1,235 121 115 6

The PRICES database server is currently 8i and will be updated to the 11g platform before 11/1/11. Additionally, the FFSS2 Oracle 10g database will be updated to Oracle 11g platform before 11/1/11. Upgrading to the same database version will allow for maintenance of one version of the database. The PRICES application is written in PowerBuilder version 8.02 and must be upgraded to version 12 to be compatible with the Oracle 11g upgrade which will occur before 11/1/11. PRICES is currently not 508 compliant. However, FFSS2 and FAMP applications are and bringing PRICES into compliance with the 1998 Amendment to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is a requirement of this task. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-220), August 7, 1998 requires that individuals with disabilities who are Federal employees or who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal department or agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of the information and data by those who are not individuals with disabilities. The Order-to-Cash process improvement initiative within PSC requires enhancements to the PRICES system. The vendor will support requirements definition, development, testing, implementation and associated business transformation through the CCB process. FFSS2 and FAMP require some reengineering through the Change Control Review Board (CCB) process to PRICES integration for improved efficiency in PSC budgeting, forecasting and rate establishment.

(b) To gain routine physical access to an HHS facility, logical access to an HHS-controlled information system, and/or access to sensitive data or information, the Contractor and its employees shall comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors; Office of Management and Budget memorandum (M-05-24); and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201; and with the personal identity verification and investigation procedures contained in the following documents: (1) HHS Information Security Program Policy. (2) HHS Office of Security and Drug Testing, Personnel Security/ Suitability Handbook, dated February 1, 2005. (3) HHS HSPD-12 Policy Document, v. 2.0. (4) Note: Based upon information provided by the Project Officer, the Contracting Officer shall insert references to OPDIV and/or local procedural guideline(s), if any; indicate if they are readily accessible to the public; and, if so, specify where they may be found. If they are not readily accessible, the Contracting Officer shall attach a copy to the solicitation and contract and reference the guideline(s) here. (c) This contract/order will entail the following position sensitivity level(s): Level 5.

Note: At the time of solicitation, based upon information provided by the Project Officer, the Contracting Officer shall specify all known levels. If the position sensitivity levels are not known at that time, the Contracting Officer shall insert the words ``To Be Determined at the Time of Award.'' However, the Contracting Officer must include the definitive position sensitivity levels in the awarded contract/order. (d) The personnel investigation procedures for Contractor personnel require that the Contractor prepare and submit background check/investigation forms based on the type of investigation required. The minimum Government investigation for a non-sensitive position is a National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) with fingerprinting. More restricted positions--i.e., those above non-sensitive, require more extensive documentation and investigation. As part of its proposal, and if the anticipated position sensitivity levels are specified in paragraph (c) above, the Offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer of (1) its proposed personnel who will be subject to a background check/investigation and (2) whether any of its proposed personnel who will work under the contract have previously been the subject of national agency checks or background investigations. (e) Investigations are expensive and may delay performance, regardless of the outcome of the investigation. Delays associated with rejections and consequent re-investigations may not be excusable in accordance with the FAR clause, Excusable Delays--see FAR 52.249-14. Accordingly, if position sensitivity levels are specified in paragraph (c), the Offeror shall ensure that the employees it proposes for work under this contract have a reasonable chance for approval. (f) Typically, the Government investigates personnel at no cost to the Contractor. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the additional investigation(s). (g) The Contractor shall include language similar to this ``HHS-Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security'' language in all subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have the same frequency and duration of (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system; (3) access to sensitive HHS data/information, whether in an HHS-controlled information system or in hard copy; or (4) any combination of circumstances (1) through (3). (h) The Contractor shall direct inquiries, including requests for forms and assistance, to the Contracting Officer or designee. (i) Within 7 calendar days after the Government's final acceptance of the work under this contract, or upon termination of the contract, the Contractor shall return all identification badges to the Contracting Officer or designee.''

HHSAR 352.239-73(a) ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY (JANUARY 2010)

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR Part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any federal department or agency permit. 1. Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and 2. Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm. The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability website (http://www.hhs.gov/od/). Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 accessibility standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense.

Price Evaluation: Offerors will be evaluated based upon price realism, price reasonableness, and price completeness/accuracy to determine the validity of the price. Total estimated ceiling price to accomplish the requirement and all of its options will be utilized as a basis for evaluating price. Price Realism: The Offerors are placed on notice that any proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low in cost(s) and/or price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of contract requirements, and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal. Price Reasonableness: The Offerors are expected to establish a reasonable price relationship between all price/cost elements. An evaluation of the Offerors' price proposals will be made to determine if they are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the technical proposal. Reasonableness determinations will be made by determining if competition exists, by comparing proposed prices with established commercial prices, and/or by comparing proposed prices with the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The IGCE is not releasable to the public. Price Risk: Price risk refers to any aspect of the Offerors' proposals that could have significant negative cost consequences for the Government. Proposals will be assessed to identify potential price risk. Where price risk is assessed, it may be described in quantitative terms or used as a best-value discriminator.

SECTION M ­ EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD M.1. GENERAL INFORMATION

Your proposal shall be evaluated to determine your organization's ability to complete all of the requirements necessary for successful performance under the contract. A proposal which merely paraphrases the requirements stated in Section C will be ineligible for award. In addition, a proposal that addresses only a part of the requirements will be considered unresponsive to the solicitation and unacceptable for award. Your proposal should show that the requirements stated in Section C of the solicitation are understood and offer a logical approach for their achievement. M.2. 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JULY 1990)

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). M.3. BASIS FOR AWARD

PSC will select the offeror that represents the best value to meet PSC's needs. Best-value tradeoff analysis involves weighing differences in proposed costs versus differences in the other evaluation criteria for each small business offeror solution. In making this comparison, the government is more concerned with superior performance capability than low cost. Each offeror's written response to the solicitation, reference information, written clarifications, and final price proposal will be taken into account in accordance with the criteria set forth below in order to make an award. M.4. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

Evaluation of all offers will be made in accordance with the criteria outlined in this section. Proposals will be scored as indicated hereafter. Technical evaluation factors as a whole are therefore significantly more important than price. The overall technical rating will be determined through the following evaluation factors. The evaluation factors are in the following descending order of priority in terms of importance. ˇ Volume 1 ­ Technical Proposal o Technical Approach o Personnel Qualifications o Management Plan o Understanding of the Project o Organizational Experience o 508 Compliance Volume 2 ­ Past Performance Volume 3 ­ Business Proposal

Volume 1, the Evaluation Board will identify strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies. Factors 15 are considered technical evaluation factors and will evaluated based on information submitted as part of the Offeror's Volume 1 submissions. Factor 6, Section 508 Compliance, shall be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable. Offeror shall provide a detail explanation on how they will comply with Section 508. Volume 2 will be evaluated separately via past performance surveys submitted to references in the Offeror's Volume 2 submissions and other information obtained by the government. Volume 3, Cost/Price will be evaluated by analysis of the Offeror's submission. Since the factors are ranked in descending order of importance, as technical scores and relative advantages and disadvantages become less distinct, difference in price between proposals are of increased importance in determining the most advantageous proposal. Conversely, as differences in price become less distinct, differences in scoring and relative advantages and disadvantages between proposals are of increased importance to the determination. The technical evaluation will be attained through a determination and analysis of strengths, weaknesses, and risks of each proposal. Technical risks will be included in the final evaluation of each factor and will not be evaluated as a separate factor. In the assessment of technical risk, the Government evaluators will consider all available information. A color coded/adjectival rating system for scoring will be utilized and the technical panel will determine final scoring, based on a consensus. The following is the color coded/adjectival rating system that will be used to evaluate offerors proposals.
Rating Blue Adjectival Exceptional Description Greatly exceeds all minimum requirements of the criteria; has a high probability of success; contains no weaknesses or deficiencies. Exceeds all the minimum requirements of the criteria; has an above average probability of success; contains no significant weaknesses and only minor, correctable weaknesses exist. Meets all the minimum requirements of the criteria; has an average probability of success; no significant weaknesses and no deficiencies Fails to meet one or more of the minimum requirements of the criteria; low probability of success; major weaknesses and/or significant number of deficiencies exist. Fails to meet any of the minimum requirements of the criteria; proposal needs major revisions; very low probability of success.

For this solicitation, all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Evaluators will also consider and reward qualitative factors such as brevity, comprehensiveness, and accuracy during their review.

Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173) HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING: 1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer

Attachment A
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination. Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of: (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications; (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications; (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400). 2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY: If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges. A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay. ** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE ** If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

Attachment A

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs. The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol. gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/. REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form 1444 (SF 1444)} Conformance Process: The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed. The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows: 1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s). 2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work. 3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

Attachment A

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request. 5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor. 6) The contractor informs the affected employees. Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper. When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.





PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS

Please answer each of the following questions with a rating that is based on objective measurable performance indicators to the maximum extent possible. Comments to support ratings may be noted on last page. The Government will assess an overall past performance rating for each reference contacted. The overall ratings of each reference will then be combined to arrive at a final past performance rating that will be assigned points based upon the following rating scheme:

RATINGS ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:

Definition		Description

Excellent		The Contractor demonstrates an excellent performance level in all categories.  There have been no performance problems and the Contractor has demonstrated initiative to enhance/exceed contractual requirements and objectives.  The Contractor also has maintained an excellent Contractor/Government relationship throughout contract performance

Good			There are no quality of service problems; no cost/price issues; and no delays. Responses to inquiries and technical/service administrative issues are consistently effective and responsive.  Non-conformance does not impact achievement of contract requirements.

Acceptable		Non-conformances are minor and have little impact in achievement of contract requirements, requires minor intervention by Government personnel to resolve issues.

Marginal		Non-conformances are impacting achievement of contract requirements, requires substantial intervention by Government personnel to resolve issues.

Unacceptable	Non-conformances are compromising the achievement of contract requirements, despite substantive intervention by Government personnel.

HHS Guide to Completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template
Purpose: This document provides Vendors with instructions on completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template for the US Department of Health and Human Services

Background: In 2001, the Information Technology Industry Council partnered with the General Services Administration to create a tool that would assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements specified in Section 508. The result of their collaboration was the 508 Evaluation Template ­ a simple, web-based checklist that allows Vendors to document how their product did or did not meet the various Section 508 Requirements.

How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized: This template is also known as the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) The Section 508 Evaluation Template consists of a long series of tables. The Summary Table is used to provide a sense of your product's overall "level-of-conformance" with the Section 508 Standards. Subsequently, the Section 1194.xx Tables contain the detailed subparagraphs that a Section 508 Standard is composed of. It is within these Section 1194.xx Tables that you will define in detail how your product did or did not comply with a specific requirement. Understanding the columns Use the following to understand the use of the three columns in the Section 508 Evaluation Template's tables: Summary Table Column Name Criteria: Supporting Features: Use Describes Subparts B, C, and D of the Section 508 Standards. Enter information summarizing a product's overall "level-of support" for the corresponding Subpart or, when appropriate, to specify Not Applicable. DO NOT ENTER REMARKS OR EXPLANATIONS IN THIS COLUMN. Enter general comments regarding a product's overall "level-of-conformance" with the Applicable Subpart. Section 1194.xx Tables Use Describes a specific guideline that a Subpart is composed of. Enter information summarizing a product's "level-of-support" for a specific guideline.

What information do I enter in columns 2 and 3? The Supporting Features and Remarks/Explanations columns are used to document exactly how a product did or did not meet the Section 508 Standards. Supporting Features (second column on 508 Evaluation Template) Language What It Means... Supports Product FULLY meets the letter and intent of the Criteria. Product does not ENTIRELY meet the letter and intent of the Criteria, but does provide some level of access. Product provides alternative methods to meet the intent of the Criteria. Product does not meet the letter or intent of the Criteria. The Criteria does not apply to the product.

Attachment B - HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template

Typical Scenario for Completing a Section 508 Evaluation Template: To complete the Section 508 Evaluation Template, enlist the services of your company's technical specialist for the product being sought for purchase. HHS requires a measure of technical detail in the responses. Once you have enlisted their assistance: 1) Determine which sections of the Technical Standards (Subpart B-1194.21-26) apply to your product.* Keep in mind that you always must complete the Functional Performance Criteria (Subpart C ­ 1194.31) and Information, Documentation, and Support (Subpart D ­ 1194.41) sections of the Section 508 Evaluation Template. 2) For each section that applies, determine if the product does or does not meet the specific Criteria elements. 3) Using the information found in the How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized section, document in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how your product did or did not meet the applicable standard.
ˇ ˇ If the product supports the standard, provide detailed examples of what accessibility features exist and how they are used to support the standard. If the product does not support the standard, remember that Section 508 allows products to meet the Access Board Standards in innovative, non-traditional ways. The product can meet the standard by providing an innovative solution, as long as the feature performs in the same manner as it does for any other user without a disability. If the product does not possess an innovative, non-traditional way of supporting the standard, provide detailed examples of exactly how the product did not meet the standard.

ˇ

4) Once documented in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how the product did or did not meet, return to the Summary Table and document the product's overall "level-of-conformance" in each of the applicable sections. 5) Post the final Section 508 Evaluation Template on your company's web site or on the GSA Buy Accessible Wizard. 6) It is the Vendor's responsibility to maintain the integrity of the data on the Section 508 Evaluation Template. The information provided on the Section 508 Evaluation Template is considered a self-representation unless expressly affirmed otherwise. Even so, HHS uses this form to complete required Market Research associated with the agency complying with Section 508 and may use the form to eliminate this product compared to other more accessible products that meet the HHS business needs.

* Please Note: Any WEB application being purchased by HHS also requires the Vendor to complete Section 1194.21 of the Section 508 Evaluation Template in addition to Sections 1194.22, 1194.31, and 1194.41.
ˇ ˇ ˇ HHS reserves the right to reject a PAT and corresponding proposal/offering if the answers do not address the standards. HHS needs the PAT to address the standards in order to evaluate it for conformance. Please answer honestly and be prepared to work with HHS to improve accessibility for your product if it is purchased. Submission of this documentation constitutes a warrant on behalf of the vendor of the conformance of their product. Remediation of a product or service to the specified conformance shall be the responsibility of the vendor.
