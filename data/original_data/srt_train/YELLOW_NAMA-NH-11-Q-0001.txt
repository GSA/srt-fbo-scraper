      FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION”






           See Page 1






      NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED


      The National Archives & Records Administration (NARA) is seeking to purchase annual maintenance and technical support for a proprietary
      software and hardware owned and developed by EMC Corporation. As the owner/developer, EMC is the only source for these items and no other
      supplies or services will satisfy NARA’s requirements for storing data pertaining to NARA’s holdings in the Archival Research Catalog
      (ARC).  Although EMC owns all licensing and distribution rights for the needed hardware and software there are vendors authorized by EMC to
      resell their products and services.



III.  A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY’S NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE)

       This is an annual requirement for the renewal of EMC’s Continuous Coverage Product Maintenance (CCPM) for the ARC Web’s data storage area
      network (SAN) equipment (hardware and software).  If NARA were to switch to another  solution other than EMC there would be associated
      costs of at least $450 to $500k and it would require a complete re-engineering of ARC (cost of new software, cost of the associated
      appliances, cost of installation, cost of reconfiguration, cost of system integration testing and cost of re-training).  There would also
      be a cost in time:   time to retrain users; time to retrain support personnel and; time to retrain system administrators.    In short,
      continuing to purchase EMC’s support which will allow NARA to keep the associated software up to date and provide hardware support to the
      SAN will be the best value for the government.


      The estimated value of the order is approximately $80,000.00 ($40,000 for the base year and an additional $40,000.00 for the option year).




      AN IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.


      41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) –“Only One Responsible Source” as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.


V.    A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR’S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED


      This acquisition meets the authority of FAR 6.302-1 which states that this authority may be used "when the supplies or services required by
      the agency are available from only one responsible source, or,…from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type
      of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."  See above II.



      A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A
      NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY SUBPART 5.2 AND, IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER 5.202 APPLIES.


      In order to insure the maximum amount of competition this requirement will be posted on FedBizOpps and the award will go to the vendor
      offering the lowest price technically acceptable.



VII.  A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE


      The dollar value of this contract is estimated to be $80,000($40,000 base year and $40,000 for the option year).  Cost risk  is  considered
      to be minimal since this is a product & service sold in substantial  quantities  to  the  general  public.   The  cost  objective  in  this
      acquisition is to obtain a fair and reasonable price by soliciting bids from as many vendors as possible using  FedBizOpps,  comparing  the
      Contractor's proposed prices and making the award to the vendor offering the lowest price technically acceptable.


VIII. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED (SEE PART 10) AND THE RESULTS  OR  A  STATEMENT  OF  THE  REASON  MARKET  RESEARCH  WAS  NOT
      CONDUCTED


      No market research was done at this time due to the fact that the requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps and will be open to all  vendors
      authorized by EMC to provide their products and services.  The  award  will  go  to  the  vendor  offering  the  lowest  price  technically
      acceptable.


IX.   ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  SEE FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)




      N/A


X.    A LISTING OF THE SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION


      N/A



XI.   A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY  TAKE  TO  REMOVE  OR  OVERCOME  ANY  BARRIERS  TO  COMPETITION  BEFORE  ANY  SUBSEQUENT
      ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED


       When EMC’s Clariion SAN approaches end of life the ARC Project will investigate whether non-proprietary technology is available to replace
       the limited source items.


XII.  CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION THAT THE JUSTIFICATION IS ACCURATE AND COMPLETE TO THE BEST OF THE CONTRACTING  OFFICER’S  KNOWLEDGE  AND
      BELIEF
