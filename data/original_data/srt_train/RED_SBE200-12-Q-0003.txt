A.    Performance Work Statement
The purpose of this firm fixed price contract is to obtain communications circuitry for the American Embassy, Brussels.

The contractor shall deliver and install the following Point-to-Point fiber optic terrestrial links and high-speed internet service to the U.S.
Embassy in Brussels:

        1. Delivery and installation of a Point-to-Point  fiber optic terrestrial link between:
         -  the U.S. Embassy, Blvd du Régent 27, 1000 Brussels and
         NATO HQ, Blvd Leopold III, 1110 Brussels.


            Speed: 50 Mbps symmetrical.
            Point-to-Point circuit interface connectors: RJ-45 with 10/100BaseT Interface.


        2. Delivery and installation of a separate Point-to-Point fiber optic terrestrial link between:
         - the U.S. Embassy Blvd du Régent 27, 1000 Brussels and
        the Logistics Service Center (Warehouse), Fabriekstraat 13, 1930 Zaventem.


      Speed: 50 Mbps symmetrical.
            Point-to-Point circuit interface connectors: RJ-45 with 10/100BaseT Interface

        3. Provision of a separate high-speed internet connection with 16 public IP addresses at:

   5.  A separate Point-to-Point connection between the American Embassy, NATO HQ and the
         Logistics Service Center (Warehouse) – Cambridge solution at 2Mbps for voice.

         • These are 4 independent circuits are not linked with each other with one exception: The public subnet assigned to the Embassy
           internet connection must be routable to the public subnet assigned to the NATO HQ location.


    • Neither of the two high speed internet connections should be linked in any way so one connection malfunction or failure does not affect the
      other.

    • No link to the Internet connection for the connection between the Embassy and the Warehouse so that an outage will not affect all 3
      circuits at the same time.

    • The Embassy does not require a VPN service.  The Embassy handles the encryption for out traffic.

   6.  Circuit Specifications:


      - ISP Interface connectors: RJ-45 with 10/100BaseT Interface.


      - ISP Availability: 24/7 operation, 365 days per year.


      - ISP Connection must NOT use Network Address Translation (NAT).


      - ISP must permit all IP protocols (including but not limited to UDP, TCP, and IPSEC) to transit without filters or proxies. Unfiltered
        access to the Internet is required without ISP firewall blocking.


      - ISP must permit installation of Customer VPN encryption devices on circuit.


      - ISP must permit ping and trace route traffic from 169.252.0.0/16 and 169.253.0.0/16 to the ISP connection (RJ45 10/100BaseT router
        interface which terminates at Customer VPN encryption device).

     7.  Quality of Service for Service Level Agreement
      -     Availability should not be less than 99.9%.
      -     Latency should be less than 200ms
      -     Packet Loss less than .5%.

B.    Circuit Downtime and Credits

Credits shall be assessed against the Contractor in those instances where the circuit during any given month or year that fail to achieve and
sustain the minimum acceptance standards stated above.


      1.  Definitions:


            Circuit Availability Acceptance Level:  Yearly Circuit Availability Acceptance Level is computed by 365 calendar days times 24 (hours
      per day) times 99.5% acceptance level equals 8,716.20 hours annum.  (365 x 24 = 8760 x 99.5% = 8,716.20).  Monthly Circuit Availability is
      computed by the calendar days per month times 24 (hours per day) times 99.5% acceptance level (example: 31 x 24 = 744 x 99.5% = 740.28)


            Downtime:  That period of time when the circuit becomes non-operational or unusable for communication or transfer of data or failures
      to meet the minimum acceptance standards. The maximum cumulative Annual downtime that shall be acceptable for corrective or preventative
      maintenance is 43.80 hours (8760 x .5%). The maximum cumulative Monthly downtime that shall be acceptable for corrective or preventative
      maintenance shall be .5% of the total available hours for the month (example: 31 x 24 = 744 x .5% = 3.72).


            Period of Downtime:  Downtime shall commence at the time first attempt for contact is made by the Government (or its representative)
      to the Contractor’s Point of Contact and shall be annotated on the Remedy Ticket and shall continue until the circuit is returned into
      Service by the Contractor.


            Downtime Credits:  Monetary value returned to the Government for failure to meet the Circuit availability requirements. Downtime
      Credits shall be assessed based on cumulative downtime time with the minimum assessment being one hour.  Downtime credit shall be computed
      as an hourly portion of the monthly subscription rate (subscription rate ÷ 30/31 days ÷ 24 hrs. = hourly rate).  There are two (2)
      situations when circuit Downtime Credits can be accumulated:


            1) Below Availability Level,
            2) Extended Downtime.


      2.    Credit for Circuit Downtime by Situation


            Below Availability Level: If the downtime accumulated for a circuit adds up to 43.80 (8760 x .5%) cumulative hours or more during any
      one contract year (365 calendar days) or depending on the number of hours for the month (example 744 x .5%) cumulative hours per month
      (example: 31 calendar day month) the Contractor shall grant a hourly credit to the Government for each hour of downtime. Each additional
      one hour increment or portion thereof will be assessed as an additional hour.


            Extended Downtime Credit(s):  Cumulative time of more than 18 hours but not greater than 24 hours for any one outage shall be
      assessed at a daily rate.  Any increment of 24 hours beyond the initial 24 hours of any one outage shall be assessed at the standards for
      the hourly rate up to 12 hours, however between 12 and 24 hours the credit shall be assessed at the daily rate.


      3.    Exceptions to Cumulating of Downtime


            Cumulating of circuit downtime shall include all unscheduled downtime deemed to be the responsibility of the Contractor, with the
      following exceptions:


            a.  When the failure to perform arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor or Sub-
      contractor as defined in the Termination for Default clause in Section I of this contract.


            b.   Malfunction of equipment, frequency fading and interference, errors of commission and/or omission by the Contractor or Sub-
      contractor, and commercial power surges or failures are considered to be normal hazards of the industry and therefore do not qualify as
      causes beyond the control of the Contractor or Sub-contractor.  The Contractor shall be charged with credits for all reported outages
      determined “no trouble found” or “came clear while testing” but which exceed 45 minutes.


      The Contracting Officer shall make final determination as to whether downtime is the responsibility of the Contractor.  If requested by the
      Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide documentation to support claims of excusable downtime.  For downtime determined to be the
      Contractor’s responsibility, the Contracting Officer may elect to assess a credit for each instance of non-performance.


      4.    Payment Reduction for Downtime Credits


            When Circuit Downtime credit(s)  is due to the Government, the total number of creditable hours shall be accumulated for the month
      and will be deducted from the payment due the Contractor in the month they accrued.


      5.    Trouble Escalation Procedure


            a.   The Government shall refer the problem to the carrier after performing tests as prescribed in the Trouble Analysis procedure.
      Obtain the name of the carrier test person and a carrier ticket number, record this information on the Government’s Remedy Ticket.


            b.   After the trouble has been referred to the carrier for two (2) hours, recall the carrier for an update on the current trouble.
      Record the carrier’s response, the name of the individual you talked with, and the carrier ticket number on the Remedy Ticket.


            c.  After the trouble has been referred to the carrier for four (4) hours, recall the carrier for an update on the current trouble.
      If the carrier’s response is not satisfactory escalate the trouble to the carrier’s management.  Record the carrier’s response, the name of
      the individual you talked with, and the carrier ticket number on the Remedy Ticket.


            d.   After the trouble has been referred to the carrier for six (6) hours, escalate the trouble to the carrier’s manager, notify ENM
      (Enterprise Network Management) at DTS-PO (Diplomatic Telecommunications Service Program), and the Operations Manager at BIMC (Beltsville
      Information Management Center).  Record the carrier’s response, the name of the individual you talked with, the carrier ticket number, and
      the names of the DTS-PO and BIMC mangers that were notified on the Remedy Ticket.

            Any other day designated by Federal law, Executive Order, or Presidential Proclamation.

      (b)   When any such day falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the following Monday is observed.  Observance of such days by Government personnel
shall not be cause for additional period of performance or entitlement to compensation except as set forth in the contract. If the contractor’s
personnel work on a holiday, no form of holiday or other premium compensation will be reimbursed either as a direct or indirect cost, unless
authorized pursuant to an overtime clause elsewhere in this contract.

      (c)   When the Department of State grants administrative leave to its Government employees, assigned contractor personnel in Government

requirements of critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by the instructions issued by the contracting officer or
his/her duly authorized representative.

      (d)   For fixed-price contracts, if services are not required or provided because the building is closed due to inclement weather,
unanticipated holidays declared by the President, failure of Congress to appropriate funds, or similar reasons, deductions will be computed as
follows:

            (1)  The deduction rate in dollars per day will be equal to the per month contract price divided by 21 days per month.

            (2)  The deduction rate in dollars per day will be multiplied by the number of days services are not required or provided.

If services are provided for portions of days, appropriate adjustment will be made by the contracting officer to ensure that the contractor is
compensated for services provided.

   e) If administrative leave is granted to contractor personnel as a result of conditions stipulated in any “Excusable Delays” clause of this
      contract, it will be without loss to the contractor. The cost of salaries and wages to the contractor for the period of any such excused
      absence shall be a reimbursable item of direct cost hereunder for employees whose regular time is normally charged, and a reimbursable item
      of indirect cost for employees whose time is normally charged indirectly in accordance with the contractor’s accounting policy.

652.225-71  SECTION 8(A) OF THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1979, AS AMENDED (AUG 1999)


    (a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with
any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the
object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and
therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited
activities under the Export Administration Act:
           (1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli business concern, or with any
      national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting
      country;


           (2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race,
      religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person;


           (3) Furnishing information with respect to the race, religion, or national origin of any U.S. person or of any owner, officer,
      director, or employee of such U.S. person;


           (4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or proposes to have any business relationship (including a
      relationship by way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply)
      with or in the State of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the State of Israel, with any Israeli national or
      resident, or with any person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in Israel;


           (5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or
      involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the State of Israel; and,


           (6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing a letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against
      doing business with the State of Israel.


    (b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden ``compliance with the boycott,'' and are therefore exempted from
Section 8(a)'s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1)-(6) above:

            (1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:

                     (i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern
                 organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,
                     (ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the
                 boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;

           (2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of
      the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no
      information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar
      exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply
      with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;
    (3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or
national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods
which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;
           (4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of
      exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;


           (5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country
      with respect to such individual or any member of such individual's family or with requests for information regarding requirements of
      employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,


           (6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country
      with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the

      identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that
      country, as may be defined by such regulations.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
principals—
    (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;
    (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property;
    (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,
this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.

      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly
average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract
period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used
for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or
(k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this
