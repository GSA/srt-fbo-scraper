SECTION C – STATEMENT OF WORK
C.1.0 Scope

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requires commercially available software that will serve as tools for SEC staff enabling
them to use interactive data in their regulatory work.  The SEC also requires technical services to install and deploy such software in the
SEC’s information systems environment.

The software tools must comport with the following guidelines:

 • Commercially Available/Off the Shelf – Software must currently exist in substantially the same form that would be used by SEC staff and would
   require no or only minor modifications to be useful to staff.

 • Capable of accommodating Interactive Data in multiple formats – Software must be flexible to accommodate data from multiple sources that staff
   may want to use, whether it is in XBRL, XML, or other interactive data formats.

 • SEC Rights in Custom Code – the SEC will have unlimited rights in any minor modifications, custom, or ad hoc software created under this
   contract.  Contractors may integrate such work into an existing “off the shelf” software product and offer it to the commercial market.  See
   the intellectual property rights clauses in Section I.

The software acquired by this solicitation/contract will serve as a system for processing and using interactive data filings that will
complement EDGAR and the Public Dissemination System (PDS).  This system is not meant to replace EDGAR.  It will access publicly disseminated
filings from EDGAR, process them on a platform separate from the EDGAR system, and provide enhanced analysis and reporting capabilities separate
from EDGAR for SEC staff.

Please be aware that the scope of this solicitation/contract excludes:

 • Validation tools – software that validates XBRL filings prior to their storage on the EDGAR system.  Contractors should assume their proposed
   solution accesses validated and accepted filings,

 • XBRL instance document creation and tagging tools, and

 • External rendering tools – this solution is not intended to render public filings for use by the public.

C.1.1 Background

The SEC is pursuing interactive data as a tool to improve the timeliness and accessibility of information contained in filings.  In 2009, the
SEC established binding schedules for operating companies to file financial statements in XBRL format and investment companies to file
risk/return summaries in XBRL format.  Previously, the SEC mandated that stock ownership forms filed by insiders (Forms 3, 4, and 5) be filed in
an interactive data format called XML.  The SEC continues to look for other forms and data systems into which interactive data could be
incorporated to help the SEC fulfill its responsibilities.

Investors, businesses, rating agencies, and other market participants benefit from data filed in interactive data format because no time
consuming steps are needed to put the data in a machine-readable format conducive to analytical applications.  Additionally, data-driven
disclosure allows computers that process the data to quickly and automatically perform calculations, filter, and apply business rules on data,
which processes would otherwise require time-consuming human effort.  Such automation is not possible if data is trapped in documents.

Data in interactive format is intended to benefit not only market participants but also SEC staff in their review, reporting, and analysis
activities.   Accordingly, the SEC seeks software designed to process, query, report on, and analyze interactive data.

C.1.2 Objectives

The SEC seeks one or more commercially available software products designed to utilize XBRL and other interactive data.  These products must fit
into one or both of the categories listed below.

NOTE: The SEC seeks to acquire at least one product for each category.  Offerors may submit proposals for either of these functionality groups
or integrated proposals for both of them.  Offerors may also submit joint proposals with business partners covering one or both groups.

   A) Interactive Data Repository (See Section C.3.2.1) – a centrally accessible repository for interactive data where filings are processed and
      made available to SEC staff for review, reporting, and analysis.  This system will store and execute analyses and business rules against
      the stored data and will perform actions based on the results.  This repository is likely to be used for additional types of interactive
      data in the future.

   B) End User Product (See Section C.3.2.2) – desktop application(s), which may be delivered in multiple ways; for example, a plug-in to
      existing desktop applications, a software application, or a browser interface.  These applications will use interactive data from a
      repository, such as the repository described above, to facilitate review, reporting, and analysis by SEC staff.

C.1.3 Operational Environment

To the extent possible, the Contractor must utilize the current SEC technology environment, providing system interoperability, reducing
complexity, and maximizing reuse of previous investments.  The SEC does not want to introduce new technology platforms into its environment
unless, in the sole judgment of the SEC, the benefits of such new technology platforms far outweigh the cost and inconvenience of their
introduction.

The SEC's current software development and production environment includes the following:

 • Existing SEC desktop applications such as Internet Explorer 6, Office 2003 or higher, and EDGAR workstation;

 • The Microsoft suite of tools (Access, Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, Visio);

 • Development tools and technology such as Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE), HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Universal Modeling Language
   (UML), XML, eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT), Java Server Page (JSP), SPRING, Java Server Face (JSF), Java Server Pages
   (JSP), IceFaces, ieSpell, iBATIS, JBoss;

 • Development tools such as Eclipse, JBuilder, ER-Studio, Rapid SQL;

 • Database systems such as Oracle, and Sybase IQ, data modeling, database programming;

 • Oracle Fusion: Oracle Application Server, Oracle Service Oriented Application (SOA) Suite, Oracle WebCenter, and Oracle Universal Content
   Manager (UCM);

 • Reporting tools such as Business Objects and Crystal Reports;

 • Web services technologies such as Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), Service Oriented Architecture Protocol (SOAP), Web Services Definition
   Languages (WSDL), and Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI);

 • Testing tools such as Test Director, Load Runner, Bobby 508 testing;

 • Version control and defect tracking tools such as Serena Version Manager (VM) and TeamTrack; and

 • Software for integration into Enterprise Portal; support for JSR 168 and other relevant portal standards.


C.1.4 Definitions

 • Interactive Data – Data that has been labeled using a computer markup language that can be processed by software for viewing and analysis. Two
   types of interactive data are XBRL and XML.

    o XBRL – eXtensible Business Reporting Language; A language for labeling data that has been developed specifically for business and financial
      reporting.  The terms below relate to XBRL:

         ▪ Linkbase - components of an XBRL taxonomy that provide information about relationships between elements and link them with
           specified external resources (e.g., providing human readable labels, links to external resources).

         ▪ Extension – A user-created addition to an XBRL taxonomy that defines new (“custom”) elements or changes element labels or
           relationships  (such as presentation, calculation, or dimension) without altering the original element.

    o XML – eXtensible Markup Language; a language for labeling data.  XBRL is an XML based language.

    o Tags/Elements - a business concept (such as Assets, Liabilities, Income) presented in computer readable format

    o Metadata – data attributes that are attached to and describe data facts.

 • Commercially Available/Off the Shelf (COTS) – Ready-made products that can be implemented in substantially the same form as they are currently
   commercially available.

 • Instance Document – An XML file that contains XBRL elements. The financial statements of a company or any part thereof, expressed in XBRL,
   would be an instance document as would an HTML file that had various XBRL items embedded in it. An instance document contains the “code” for
   the tags and the structure that belongs to the tagged data. Instance documents are built from a combination of XML specifications and XBRL.  A
   number of XBRL taxonomies are in use, including US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

 • Business Rule – A set of instructions programmed into the Interactive Data Repository and the End User Product to be performed when a
   condition is present in processed data.  These conditions may be in the form of logical and mathematical computations, thresholds,
   constraints, and/or field definitions that run against individual or combined instance documents, data, metadata, and statistics.

 • Filer – an entity that submits information to the SEC pursuant to statutory requirements.  Examples of submitted information include financial
   statements in XBRL format.

 • EDGAR – the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System; currently, filers use this system to submit documents to the SEC in
   HTML, ASCII, and XML  format.

C.3.1.4 Installation and Configuration

The Contractor shall license and install the software for the Interactive Data Repository and/or End User Product and configure them for use in
the SEC’s operating environment.

C.3.2 Functional Requirements

C.3.2.1 INTERACTIVE Data Repository  (“Repository”)

C.3.2.1.1 Processing

C.3.2.1.1.1  The SEC requires that the Repository shall –

   1) receive XBRL and other interactive data filings, including from the EDGAR data stream and load that data into a database.  Files from the
      EDGAR system include instance documents and one or more extension schema, presentation, calculation, reference and definition linkbases.
      Once configured, the Repository must perform this work in an automated manner.

   2) load, store, and process all associated metadata, including metadata in the taxonomy and linkbases that accompany the filing, in the
      database. Metadata includes but is not limited to descriptions of elements, parent/child relationships between elements defined in the US
      GAAP Taxonomy, and calculations defined in the US GAAP Taxonomy and in filers’ calculation linkbases.  The SEC considers the appropriate
      use of metadata in its systems to be of high importance. When retrieving data from previous periods, the Repository must utilize the
      appropriate taxonomy.  Once configured, the Repository must perform this work in an automated manner.

   3) make the data it processes and stores accessible to other applications, particularly the End User Product described below, through standard
      interfaces.

   4) make the metadata it processes and stores available to SEC staff for analysis and reports.

      For example, using parent/child or calculation relationships and calculation linkbases relevant to each filer will allow ratios to be
      calculated across a wide range of industries.

C.3.2.1.1.2  The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Repository -

   1) permit connection and access to multiple data sources.  Such data may include, when the data becomes available, interactive data on
      Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization websites.  The Contractor should indicate if the Repository can upload data from
      external sources, including XBRL and other interactive data files, and how the uploaded data can be segregated.  The Contractor must
      indicate if its solution requires additional data subscriptions and/or any other third party products or services that are not included
      within their proposal.

   2) perform time sensitive functions, such as generating alerts and calculating statistics, within seconds of a triggering condition.

C.3.2.1.2 Business Rules and Analyses

C.3.2.1.2.1  The SEC requires that the Repository shall –

   1) capture, store, and manage business rules and analyses that detect anomalies such as those defined in the Use Cases (see Appendix A-1).
      Once configured, the Repository must perform this work in an automated manner.  If the Contractor writes such business rules on the SEC’s
      behalf, the Contractor must keep information relating to the business rules confidential.

   2) process data according to the business rules and trigger defined actions through a business rules engine.

   3) restrict access to business rules to authorized users.

   4) schedule the execution of the analyses and business rules (e.g., continuously, periodically, event-triggered, and ad-hoc).

C.3.2.1.2.2  The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Repository –

   1) permit the Repository administrator, an in-house SEC staff member, to define and implement business rules and analyses that detect
      situations that require further action (as opposed to requiring that the Contractor write and implement business rules on behalf of the
      SEC).

   2) have a programming language for business rules that the Repository administrator described above could use to configure business rules and
      analyses flexibly.  The Repository administrator is not expected to be a technology professional.  Such a language may include, but is not
      restricted to, natural language programming, familiar syntax (e.g., Microsoft Excel), and a command line interface.

   3) permit the Repository administrator to configure and execute ad hoc logical, mathematical, and text operations and procedures on one or
      more instance documents, data, and metadata located in the Repository.  These may include, but are not limited to, company and industry
      data compilation, metadata (custom element, tag) analyses, statistical data generation, the attachment of ticker symbols and other
      externally-sourced data, and report generation.  Examples are contained in Appendices A-1 and A-2.

   4) permit the set up of a range of statistical calculations to be performed on the data and metadata ((e.g., average Total Revenues for a
      specific SIC (Standard Industrial Classification), as used by the Division of Corporation Finance)).

C.3.2.1.3 Notifications and Alerts

The SEC prefers, but does not require that the Repository -

   1) support automated processes that notify designated staff of specific conditions (e.g., a filing is ready for review, a threshold has been
      crossed).  The means of notification may be email, SMS, or online notifications and alerts.  The content of the notifications may take the
      form of hyperlinks, text, or graphical information.  The Repository should not copy and distribute the file or data that triggered the
      alert; rather, it should link to it.

   2) generate alerts and notifications within seconds of a triggering condition.

   3) integrate with Microsoft Active Directory for purposes such as access control, setting up profiles, and selecting staff to receive
      notifications, alerts, and email.

NOTE: If the Repository does not have a built in alert and notification service, it is acceptable if the Repository seamlessly interfaces with
an external one.

C.3.2.1.4 Administrator Reporting

The SEC requires that the Repository shall –

   1) generate administrator-defined and predefined reports about its configuration, contents, compiled data, and related systems for purposes of
      evaluating how the Repository is used.

   2) calculate and compile metrics about filings and their use.  These may include the number of filings processed, a report on Level One
      business rules triggered (Level One rule is defined as a rule triggered as a result of a critical threshold crossed), and metadata reports
      (refer to Appendix A-2 of this document for examples of metadata reports and metrics).

C.3.2.1.5 User Facility

The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Repository have a user facility to support the following tasks that are described more fully in
the End User Product section:

   1) drill down (see C.3.2.2.5),

   2) audit (see C.3.2.2.7),

   3) linking back to source data (see C.3.2.2.6),

   4) reporting (see C.3.2.2.2).

                                                                  *     *     *

C.3.2.2 End User Product (“Product”)

C.3.2.2.1 Business Rules and Analysis

C.3.2.2.1.1  The SEC requires that the Product shall -

   1) capture, store, and manage user-defined business rules and analyses both to detect situations that require further action and to trigger
      user-defined actions.  These business rules will be executed against –

        a. the data repository to which the Product is connected, and

        b. any data the user has imported into the Product for analysis and reporting.

   2) permit the user to run the business rules in a user-specified manner (e.g., real-time, periodically, event triggered, and ad-hoc).

C.3.2.2.1.2  The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Product –

   1) permit business rules to be created by end users who are not technology professionals using either natural language or syntax similar to
      that found in Microsoft Excel.  Basic functions should require little or no instruction while more complex functions should require no more
      than a single training course.

C.3.2.2.2 Reports and Analytics

C.3.2.2.2.1  The SEC requires that the Product shall -

   1) enable users to create reports using the data in the repository to which the Product is connected.

   2) enable users to export reports in a variety of commonly used file formats that are either native to, or can be opened by, Microsoft Office
      products.

C.3.2.2.2.2  The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Product –

   1) permit users to configure and execute ad hoc logical and mathematical operations on one or more instance documents, data, and metadata.

   2) permit users to create reports using the following criteria:

     a) Metadata – reports on the tags that are used, including but not limited to custom elements, extension taxonomies, and industry use.
        Examples of such reports can be found in Appendix A-2.

     b) Performance measurements – reports on the number of filings analyzed, including those in progress.

     c) Time series reporting – reports on changes in attributes of entities over time.

     d) Comparisons – reports on entity attributes with results displayed side–by-side. Comparison reports may incorporate monetary,
        statistical, and text data (e.g., footnotes), and/or the respective metadata for those data.

     e) Filers – reports on filing entities with their contact information and filing history; also a sorting function to sort by industry.

    3 enable users to create reusable reporting and analysis templates.

   4) enable users to share reports and report templates with other users and to contribute templates to a centrally accessible library.

   5) permit the user to join multiple data types from multiple sources to create reports.

   6) when a user exports a report, permit the exported file to retain embedded formulas where appropriate.

C.3.2.2.3 Text Analysis

The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Product –

   1) perform free-text searches, which would include a search using Boolean criteria and filters based on metadata and other specified
      attributes.  Wildcards, regular expressions, and English stemming searches are preferred methods.

   2) perform text mining: extract text from filings and imported data and assign rank, relevance, and priority to results to gain insights.

C.3.2.2.4 Notifications and Alerts

The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Product -

   1) support automated processes that notify designated staff of specific conditions (e.g., a filing is ready for review, a threshold has been
      crossed).  The means of notification may be email, SMS, and online notifications and alerts.  The content of the notifications may take the
      form of hyperlinks, text, and graphical information.  The Product should not copy and distribute the file or data that triggered the alert;
      rather, it should provide a link to it.

   2) integrate with Microsoft Active Directory for selecting staff to receive notifications, alerts, and email.

NOTE: If the Product does not have a built-in alert and notification service then it is acceptable if the Product seamlessly interfaces with an
external one.

C.3.2.2.5 Drill Down Capability

The SEC prefers, but does not require that the Product –

   1) enable users to drill into (that is, examine supporting data and derived computations) any fact or data element to view its composition and
      source, including metadata. Where the data is a statistic, the user should be able to view the data that comprise it (e.g., where the
      current ratio is displayed the user can easily view current assets and current liabilities and their underlying data).

   2) enable users to create individualized multi-tab information dashboards with drill down capability.

C.3.2.2.6 Link to Original Filing

Where a user is accessing data about one or more entities, the SEC prefers but does not require the Product to provide a mechanism to easily
access the official source document or file of record relating to the data (e.g., provide a hyperlink to the company 10-K stored in EDGAR in
HTML format).  Such links should be present in reports and other analyses created by the user.

C.3.2.2.7 Auditing Function

The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Product -

   1) record, store, and retrieve work performed on data for purposes of internal documentation, litigation support, and auditing.

   2) store audit reports in a centrally accessible location for backup, restore, and archiving purposes.

   3) enable users to add comments to audit reports.

   4) indicate if the data used in an end user application has been modified from the original (e.g., if the amount in a spreadsheet has been
      edited from the original amount in the database to which the Product is connected, the cell changes color).

C.3.2.2.8 Custom Element Handling

The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Product –

   1) explicitly identify custom elements (e.g., by highlighting them) for easy identification by an end user.

   2) support mapping of custom elements to standard tags.  The Product should retain these mappings for future use, potentially storing them in
      the data repository to which the Product is connected.

C.3.2.2.9 Help and User Support

The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Product –

   1) provide online end user help functions.  Examples of online help functions include context-sensitive help, searchable topic files, and end
      user documentation.  Please indicate if the help files would be available when the user is not connected to an internal network or the
      internet.

   2) provide assistance in performing some tasks such as creating reports, business rules, and analyses.  For example, assistance may take the
      form of a wizard (step-by-step guidance) function.

   3) document and explain user-generated errors.  Input errors should not result in application termination or loss of data.

C.3.2.2.10 Security Measures and Access Control

C.3.2.2.10.1 The SEC requires that the Product shall -

   1) permit the implementation of application level controls that will prevent unauthenticated users from having access to the Product.

   2) permit the configuration of access controls for both individual Product functions and specific data according to roles of individual users.



   3) comply with the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) for security on the desktop.

   4) comply with Section 508 requirements for desktop or browser-based applications, as appropriate (see C.2.5 and H.6 of this document above
      for more information on Section 508).

C.3.2.2.10.2  The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Product -

   1) integrate with existing authorization and authentication systems including the use of Active Directory.

C.3.2.2.11 Product Usage Reports

If the Product has a centrally administered or controlled component (e.g., a hosted service, a subscription service, a product with a variable
usage fee), then the SEC requires that the system shall generate administrator-defined and predefined reports about its configuration, usage,
user activities, contents, compiled data, and related systems for purposes of evaluating how the system is used.  This includes a mechanism to
determine usage fees, if any.

                                                                  *     *     *

C.3.2.3 USE CASEs
The use cases in Appendix A-1 are an integral part of this solicitation and illustrate some of the functionality sought for both the Interactive
Data Repository and the End User Product. Contractor(s) must respond to the use cases applicable to their proposal.  The Use Case response
exhibit to the Proposal should not exceed 15 pages.  Responses to the Useful Metadata Reports in Appendix A-2 are encouraged, but not required.

The Contractor shall keep the Interactive Data Repository and/or End User Product operational and maintain functionality throughout the term of
this contract.  The Contractor shall respond to production issues, provide for escalated user inquiries, and provide disaster recovery support
and software bug fixes.  In addition to these services, the Contractor shall provide software updates to accommodate updated versions of
standard taxonomies, which can be located at  http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/edgar taxonomies.shtml.  The SEC regards cyclical updates that
enable Contractor’s software to accommodate new taxonomies to be a part of ordinary maintenance.

C.3.4.2 Enhancements to COTS Product

Any enhancements (including new or changed functionality) made by the Contractor to its software which, as stated previously, is expected to be

guaranteed time to respond to user and system-wide problems, how problems will be fixed, and how planned enhancements are to be deployed.


The Contractor shall incorporate feedback from the COTR and shall provide a revised version of the SLA to the COTR for review and approval. The
approved SLA will be incorporated into the contract as a modification.  Once the software is operating under the SLA, the Contractor shall
provide SLA reports each quarter detailing support calls, the work performed, and time to resolve problems.

C.3.4.4 Software Upgrades


The SEC prefers, but does not require, that the Contractor monitor changes to interactive data specifications, changes to interactive data
standards, and changes to the regulatory requirements concerning interactive data. The Contractor shall, on request, assess the impact of these
changes on the Contractor’s software.  The Contractor shall state its ability to upgrade its software in a timely manner to accommodate changes
to the specifications, standards, and regulations. It shall also state if the work would be included under the software maintenance contract.
Additionally, the Contractor shall inform the SEC if and how its software could accommodate the possible changes listed below under the expected
software maintenance contract:
      o   Formula specification;
      o   Inline specification;
      o   Versioning specification; and
      o   Rendering specification.

C.3.5 Travel

Travel shall be pre-approved by the COTR by submitting travel plans with names, dates, locations and estimated expenses at least two weeks in
advance of the planned travel.  Reimbursement is subject to the following limitations: (1) any subsistence allowance (i.e., meals and lodging)
is limited by a per diem allowance prescribed by the Federal per diem schedule
(http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentId=17943&contentType= GSA_BASIC); (2) expenses incurred as a result of travel using a
personal automobile are reimbursed as prescribed on the link above; (3) reimbursement of air and train travel is limited to the most economical
rate and reasonably traveled route; and (4) each out-of-pocket travel and allowable miscellaneous administrative expense exceeding $75 requires
a receipt that is to be attached to the invoice. The Contractor shall submit the required documentation to the COTR no later than ten (10)
business days after completion of each trip.

C.3.6  Contract Termination

CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is viewable at http://www/access-board.gov.

For contracts issued on or after June 25, 2001, Subsection 508(a)(30) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires that: When federal departments
or agencies develop, procure, maintain or use Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) they must ensure that the EIT allows Federal employees
with disabilities to have access to and use of information and that data is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by other
Federal employees; and, that individuals with disabilities who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal
Department or agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public without disabilities.
The Contractor agrees to abide by this law and to ensure that all information created or used under this contract conforms to the above
requirements.

In order to comply with the Functional Performance Criteria (36 CFR 1194.31) and Information Documentation and Support (36 CFR 1194.41) aspects
of Section of 508, the Contractor shall submit all soft copies in a format that will be readable by SEC’s standard screen reader.  All imbedded
charts, graphs, pictures, etc., must be accessible and understandable through a screen reader.  To view the entire text on 36 CFR Part 1194, go
to www.section508.gov or www.access-board.gov and for 48 CFR Subpart 39.2, go to www.arnet.gov/far.

All web sites and applications have to be compliant with Section 508.  See also section C.2.5.

H.7 Organizational Conflicts Of Interest (OCOI)

The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor’s knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could
give rise to an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCOI), as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5.  The Contractor further warrants that it has
disclosed all such relevant information to the Contracting Officer.

The Contractor agrees that if it discovers an actual, apparent, or potential OCOI after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure, in
writing, to the Contracting Officer.  This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take,
after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual, apparent or potential conflict.

If the SEC discovers an actual or potential conflict after award, it may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part.  If the
OCOI is discovered prior to award and the SEC concludes, in its sole discretion, that the OCOI cannot be mitigated, no award will be made.  If
the Contractor did not disclose relevant information or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the SEC may terminate
the contract for default, debar the Contractor from SEC contracting, or pursue other remedies as may be permitted by law or by this contract.

In protecting the SEC’s integrity, the Contracting Officer is vested with the broadest possible discretion as to determining whether an OCOI
exists and what remedy is appropriate.  For this contracting action, all that is required in finding such a conflict is some evidence that facts
exist which could be alleged to constitute an actual or apparent conflict of interest.  Accordingly, it is in each Contractor’s best interest to
fully inform the Contracting Officer as early as possible to allow the Contracting Officer the maximum opportunity to find ways to mitigate or
resolve such potential conflicts of interest.

H.8  Contractor Personnel

H.8.1  Contractor Responsibilities/Standards Of Conduct


The Contractor shall furnish all managerial, supervisory, and personnel to successfully, effectively, and efficiently accomplish the work
required under this contract.

Contractor personnel are employees of the Contractor and under its administrative control and supervision.  The Contractor shall select,
supervise and exercise control and direction over its employees under this contract.  The SEC will not exercise any supervision over the
Contractor’s employees.  The Contractor is accountable to the SEC for the actions of Contractor’s personnel.
The Contractor’s employees, when on-site at SEC facilities under this contract, shall only engage in duties specified in Section C, and not in
other business, or political, charitable or other duties.
The Contractor shall not recruit on SEC premises or otherwise act to disrupt official SEC business.

The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining satisfactory standards of employee competency, conduct, appearance, and integrity, and shall
be responsible for taking such disciplinary action with respect to its employees as may be necessary.  Contractor employees are expected to
adhere to standards of conduct that reflect credit on themselves, their employer, the SEC and the Federal Government.

The SEC reserves the right to review all resumes of all personnel assigned to this contract and the results of the background investigations
conducted by the Contractor. The SEC has the right to require the removal of any Contractor personnel assigned to this contract, at any time,
for any reason.


H.8.2  Key Personnel


The Contractor shall designate specific key personnel who are essential to the successful performance of this Contract.  Key personnel shall be
available for full-time assignment as necessary to efficiently manage the Contract work and shall be available on the effective date of award.



H.8.2.1  Contractor Substitution Of Key Personnel


Following award, and throughout the life of this Contract, the Contractor shall permit no substitution of key personnel without the written
consent of the Contracting Officer, unless such substitutions are necessitated by an individual’s sudden illness, death or termination of
employment.  In the event that substitution of personnel is desired, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least
thirty (30) calendar days before any key personnel substitution is made, if possible.  The Contractor shall submit a justification in sufficient
detail to permit evaluation of the impact on the contract or its performance, with the resume of the proposed replacement personnel. The
Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer’s written approval prior to any changes in the contract participation of the personnel named as
key personnel.  Proposed substitute personnel shall have experience and education at least substantially equal to those of the personnel being
replaced.  Requests for substitutions shall provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating such changes, a resume for each
proposed substitute, and any other information as requested by the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer will evaluate such requests and
promptly notify the Contractor of approval or disapproval thereof.

H.8.3     Background Check for Contractor Personnel

H.8.3.1  Pre-Employment Check

The Contractor shall be subject to a complete pre-employment check, which will be completed by the SEC.  The pre-employment check shall include
a background investigation of each proposed employee under this contract to determine suitability for employment on the basis of qualifications
for the job.  The Contractor shall submit U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Standard Form 85P for each prospective employee.  OPM
Standard Form 85P is available at http://www.opm.gov/forms.  The Government reserves the right of final approval for prospective employees.  The
pre-employment check shall include, but not be limited to the checks identified below.  The Contractor shall make its best efforts to provide
employees that pass the SEC’s security screening.  Failure of employee(s) to pass the security screening is not a justifiable cause for schedule
slippages.  The SEC is currently revising its security processes and there may be a change to this process by time of award.

H.8.3.2  Criminal History Check

The SEC may contact local law enforcement authorities and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to determine the criminal history of each
prospective contract employee.

H.8.3.3  Credit History Check

Credit history shall evidence the Contract employee to be responsible with credit obligations. A Contract employee receiving an unfavorable
credit rating must be approved by the COTR prior to acceptance to this Contract. In the event of an unsatisfactory credit rating, the Contractor
shall submit an explanation of the circumstances and the employee shall not be assigned to the contract prior to Contracting Officer approval.

H.8.3.4  Background Checks

Due to the sensitive nature of this work, the SEC may conduct background checks of proposed key personnel in addition to reference checks.  It
shall be the responsibility of the Contractor throughout the life of this contract to inform the SEC of any changes in its key personnel so that
the appropriate background and reference checks may be conducted.  The Contractor also agrees to include the substance of this clause in any of
its subcontracts.

The Contractor shall conduct a background investigation regarding the criminal record and credit history of all employees who will be assigned
to work on the contract.  The Contractor shall not assign to work on the contract and shall immediately remove from work on the contract any
employee who has been convicted within the past ten years of fraud or any other felony.

The Contractor shall certify to the SEC that a background investigation has been conducted on each employee who is assigned to work on the
contract.  The Contractor shall conduct follow-up background investigations every twelve months on each employee assigned to the contract,
unless the SEC directs otherwise.

H.9 Intellectual Property Rights

The SEC is buying commercial items under this Contract, and the parties’ intellectual property rights are governed generally by Section I,
clauses 52.227-14, Alt. III, and 52.227-15.  Under clause 52.227-14, the SEC shall have unlimited rights in any data first produced in
performance of this Contract.

L.6  Proposal Preparation

L.6.1 Exceptions, Deviations, Assumptions

Within the first two (2) pages of each proposal the Offeror shall identify and explain any exceptions, deviations taken, or conditional
assumptions made with respect to its proposal versus the requirements of the RFP.  Any such items shall contain sufficient explanation and
justification to permit evaluation.  All benefits to the SEC shall be explained for each item.  Such items may not make a proposal unacceptable
unless they fail to provide sufficient benefits to the SEC, or result in material deviations from the requirements of the contract as stated in
Section C.  The SEC maintains the right to determine if any exceptions, deviations or conditional assumptions constitute a material deviation.
Therefore, Offerors are cautioned that any exceptions or deviations to the RFP may render its proposal to be non-compliant and ineligible for
award.

L.6.2 Price Proposal

The Price Proposal containing pricing information shall be submitted in a separate volume from the Technical Proposal

L.6.2.1  Offerors are encouraged to propose fixed prices to the extent that fixed pricing is appropriate.  If the Offeror proposes labor hours,
the Offeror must propose one or more labor categories with hourly rates and the estimated number of hours.  The proposed pricing shall be for
working off-site (not at SEC facilities).

L.6.2.2  The Price Proposal shall include a total price for Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) 0001 through 0006, including a breakdown of all
pricing for each CLIN in Section B except Travel.  Do not propose cost for Travel which is reimbursable per the Federal Travel Regulation.  All
pricing must be preferred customer commercial pricing or better.

L.6.2.3  Price Proposals shall include:

      a.  A copy of the company’s most recent financial statement or an up-to-date Dun & Bradstreet report validating your company's ability to
financially support and fulfill the requirements.
      b.  A copy of the company’s current CCR registration to confirm that the data is accurate and up to date.

      complete and concise manner.

   b. The Offeror shall demonstrate its ability to comply with the applicable requirements and explain how such compliance is achieved.
      Statements such as “the Offeror understands,” or “the Offeror will comply” and statements that paraphrase the Statement of Work or other
      contract requirements are inadequate.

   c. The Technical Proposal shall not refer to price.  However, information concerning resources such as labor hours, materials, and
      subcontracts, if applicable, shall be included in the Technical Proposal so that the SEC can evaluate the Offeror’s understanding of the
      scope of the required work.

   d. The SEC welcomes Offerors to partner with other firms that may have software products or particular expertise in XBRL to improve the
      overall product quality.

SECTION M – EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS FOR AWARD



M.1 Evaluation of Proposals

    a.      The SEC reserves the right to award the contract based on initial Proposals received without discussions or negotiations of such
       Proposals.  Therefore, it is critically important that each Proposal be fully responsive to the RFP, without exception to any provision.
       The SEC reserves the right to make a competitive range determination and select the evaluated proposals to receive further consideration.
        The SEC also reserves the right to conduct discussions, if later determined to be necessary, with Offerors making the competitive range
       (i.e. the most highly rated proposals, unless the range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency).

    b.      To be accepted and eligible for evaluation, proposals must be prepared in accordance with this solicitation and must comply with the
       instructions given in this solicitation document and must meet all the solicitation requirements.

    c.      The SEC anticipates awarding a contract to the Offeror(s) whose proposal is the best value to the SEC, based upon an analysis of the
       factors below.  Note that proposals will be evaluated on all factors and no one factor is determinative.  For instance, the SEC may award
       an Offeror that does not offer the lowest price or an Offeror that has the highest technically rated proposal.  Offerors will be awarded
       when in the best interest of the SEC.  The SEC reserves the right to make no award pursuant to this solicitation.

    d.      The Functional and Technical Requirements factor is more important than User Session and Past Performance factors, which in turn are
       of more importance than Management Approach and Key Personnel factors.  Technical factors combined are more important than Price.


M.2 Technical Evaluation Factors for Award

Proposals will be evaluated on the following factors:

Factor 1: Functional and Technical Requirements
The SEC will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror’s COTS solution meets the applicable functional and technical requirements, either
individually or jointly with a partner.  Attachment 4, Functional Requirements Matrix, will be included in the evaluation of this Factor.  The
Offeror’s proposal will also be evaluated on its demonstrated understanding of relevant technology, such as XBRL 2.1 and Dimensions 1.0.

Factor 2: User Sessions
The evaluation of Offeror’s software based on its proposed User Session script and its actual performance at a User Session, if invited to
perform.



After evaluating submitted proposals, the SEC reserves the option to establish a competitive range.  Those Offerors making the competitive range
may be invited to perform the User Session.  If no competitive range is established, the SEC may invite all Offerors to perform User Sessions.

Factor 3: Past Performance
The SEC will evaluate the Offeror’s record of Past Performance in similar projects. Specific criteria for evaluating Past Performance include
the Offeror’s ability to conform to contract requirements, to adhere to contract schedules, and Offeror’s commitment to customer satisfaction.
If no direct or similar experience is provided, this factor will receive a neutral rating.

Factor 4: Management Approach
The SEC will evaluate the degree to which the Offeror’s overall management solution demonstrates an understanding of, and meets the management
requirements of, this solicitation.

Factor 5: Key Personnel
The SEC will evaluate the documentation/resume of Key Personnel provided pursuant to the instructions in Section L in order to determine the
qualifications of the Key Personnel being proposed by the Offeror.


M.3 Price Evaluation

Price evaluation will be based on comparison of the proposed prices and price reasonableness.   The SEC may compare Offerors' pricing to the
following:
      1. Pricing from other Government contracts for work of a similar nature.
      2. Government Cost Estimates.
      3. Pricing from other Offerors for this competition.
      4. Market prices.



                                                             Appendix A-1: Use Cases

The use cases in this section are specific examples of how SEC staff may use the Interactive Data Repository and End User Product.  Offerors are
encouraged to respond to the use cases that can be executed by their proposed solution.  Responses should indicate the extent to which the goals
in each use case can be fulfilled and should include supporting evidence, such as reports, analyses, system walk through/screenshots, diagrams,
and other presentation methods.  If a solution cannot perform all the functions in the use case, please clearly explain what it can and cannot
do.

The SEC has provided sample data below for Offerors to use in preparing their use case responses. The SEC prefers that Offerors use this data.

Data from Forms 3, 4, and 5 filed on EDGAR:

http://www.sec.gov/nb/oid_demonstration/ownership-20090929.pdf

http://www.sec.gov/nb/oid_demonstration/ownership-20090929.zip

http://www.sec.gov/nb/oid_demonstration/xml-20090929.zip

Data from XBRL Filings filed on EDGAR:

http://www.sec.gov/nb/softwaretools/data-20091215.zip

Forms 3, 4, and 5 refer to ownership related filings and may be used to demonstrate the data repository’s capability to process and store data
in additional formats, or the End User Product’s ability to connect to and use data in additional formats.



Use Case 1

A.  Use Case Goal: Using the End User Product, create a report containing text block elements from multiple filings that relate to a particular
disclosure.

Step 1: Set Criteria
Using the set of XBRL filings, apply the following criteria to create reports:
1) Identify a group of companies by selecting one or multiple Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Codes from all SIC Codes, as used by the
   Division of Corporation Finance, or uploading a list of CIK codes from Excel,
2) Enter the filing date range for the documents from which information is sought,
3) Select the Form type (10-K, 10-Q, etc)
4) Select whether to show original and amended filings, or only the most recent amended filing of a given type and period.

Step 2: Create Reports
Report One – Text blocks across companies in SIC codes selected above:
1) Select text block element (for example, Revenue Recognition Policy Text Block),
2) Create a report with all the Revenue Recognition Policy Text Blocks from selected SIC codes that met the criteria, displayed adjacent to one
   another for easy comparison.

Report Two – Text block for same company from multiple reports:
1) Select Company by Name or CIK,
2) Specify “Last 4 Quarters,”
3) Select Form 10-Q,
4) Select whether to show the original or the most recently amended filings, if any,
5) Select one of the same text block elements as above,
6) Report will have text blocks for all four quarters displayed side-by-side for easy comparison.

B.  Use Case Goal: Create a report showing the ratio of Impairments divided by Total Assets for all or a selection of SIC codes from filings
filed between February 2009 and April 2009.  The report should permit drill down into the report results.  Explain how the End User Product
retrieved the source set of filings from the sample data.

Step 1: Set Criteria
Using the set of XBRL filings, apply the following criteria to create reports:
1) Select one or multiple SIC Codes from all SIC codes (or upload list of CIK codes).
2) Enter the filing date range for the documents,
3) Select the Form type (10-K, 10-Q, etc)
4) Select whether to show original and amended filings, or only the most recent amended filing of a given type and period.

Step 2: Create Formula and Apply to Report
1) Create the following formula and use as a report metric: Goodwill Restructuring Charges (US GAAP Taxonomy tagged item) divided by Assets,
   Total (US GAAP Taxonomy tagged item).

   NOTE: Preferably, the user will be able to select tags within a formula building application from a taxonomy listing within the program; user
   should not have to enter tags from memory or manually.

2) Report is displayed, showing ratios for the instance documents from companies that fit the criteria in step 1.  Report should display the
   results adjacent to one another for easy comparison.


Step 3: Demonstrate the End User Product’s Ability to Drill Down Into Detail Elements
1) From the created report, user should be able to view underlying data facts and tags that went into the ratio calculation,
2) From the created report, user should be able to access and view the original filing (10-K, 10-Q) of a displayed company from which the
   underlying data originated,
3) User should be able to export the created report to Excel.  Once exported, the report should retain any formulas used to calculate results,
   which formulas may be used in subsequent analysis.

   NOTE: the Product should also have a comprehensive range of accounting ratios defined in the software for use in reporting and analysis.  One
   example of a ratio would be the quick ratio, which can be calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities.  The Product should
   also permit the user to set up ad hoc formulas for custom XBRL tags.  The Product should also support the ability to automate report
   generation in addition to creating reports manually.


Use Case 2

A.  Use Case Goal: Generate reports of filings that meet certain financial criteria. This will require that the Interactive Data Repository
process filer XBRL financial statements to generate statistics that can be used to flag filings in a subsequent period.

Write business rules for the data repository to perform the following calculations and actions.

1) Calculate return on assets (ROA) and return on sales (ROS) for each filing as it arrives:
     a) Example: ROA = Net Income + Interest Expense / Total Assets [US GAAP elements = Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders,
        Basic + Interest Expense, Total / Assets, Total]
     b) Example: ROS = Net Income / Sales [US GAAP elements = Net Income (Loss) Available to Common Stockholders, Basic / Revenues, Total]


      NOTE: We expect that the ratios will utilize the metadata in  the  calculation  linkbase  and  the  standard  US  GAAP  taxonomy  to  bring
      comparability across a wide range of industries. For example, we expect that Revenues,  Total  will  include  ALL  the  child  elements  of
      Revenues, Total.  This would include, for example, (1) Advertising Revenue, Total and (2) Financial Services Revenue,  Total.  Using  these
      parent-child relationships in the standard taxonomy will allow the ratio to be calculated across a range of industries.

2) Within the calendar quarter, aggregate ROA and ROS across all firms, calculating in real-time:
     a) Mean, median, and standard deviation of all filings,
     b) Mean, median, and standard deviation of industries by individual or multiple SIC codes.

3) Create a report summarizing these statistics at the end of each quarter.

B.  Use Case Goal: Flag filings based on the calculations contained in the report, notifying staff of their existence via email, with a  link  to
the filing in the email.

1) Based on the previous calculations, flag all subsequent filings whose ROA is two standard deviations above or below the mean from a set of
   companies:
   a) Subset – the mean for all companies in one or more SIC codes in a particular time period,
   b) Global – the mean for all companies that filed in a particular time period

   NOTE: Please indicate if this processing would be performed in near real time.

2) Based on the previous calculations, flag a filing based on potential changes that may take place from one quarter to the next.  One such flag
   should be placed through the following process:
   a) Calculate the difference between each filer’s current ROS and what it reported the previous quarter (e.g., if 10% in Q1 filing and 5% in Q2
      filing, then the difference is -5%)
   b) Calculate the percent increase or decrease in each filer’s accounts receivable from what it reported in the prior quarter (e.g., $100M in
      Q1 filing and $50M in Q2 filing is a change of -50%)
   c) Flag all filings that, based on the above calculations, have both of the following characteristics:
        i. Report a change in ROS that is one standard deviation below the mean for a set of filers in the same quarter, and
       ii. Report a change in accounts receivable that is one standard deviation above the mean for a set of filers in the same quarter.


Use Case 3

Use Case Goal: Alert staff that data in a filing has exceeded several user-defined thresholds that are calculated by comparing one reporting
period to the next.

Example:  A user wants to alert two staff members if a filing contains data indicating that a filer has a decline in reserves from one quarter
to another greater than 10%, but also has increasing net income and increasing income from operations during that same period.

Please demonstrate the following functions:
1) Create the business rule(s) for the Interactive Data Repository setting up these conditions.
2) Create a report showing this condition.
3) Alert two staff members via email and link to the report within the email.



                                                      Appendix A-2 – Useful Metadata Reports


These reports, created using the End User Product, should provide analysis, statistics, and reporting on the metadata provided to the SEC in
Exhibit 101 filings.  Exhibit 101 refers to the interactive data filing attached to the HTML file transmitted to EDGAR.

Please note that the SEC prefers, but does not require, that the End User Product be able to create these reports.  It is anticipated that the
End User Product will access processed metadata from the data repository to which it is connected.

1) Provide an open report-builder application that can constrain the report examples below in Item 2 by some or all of the following criteria:
   a) Date from, date to, or as at a particular date,
   b) Type of filing (10-Q, 10-K, etc),
   c) Amended or original filing,
   d) SIC code or multiple SIC codes,
   e) Report of filings by A/D group or multiple A/D groups (SEC staff would provide detail of the entities in each group),


        NOTE - Assistant Director (A/D) Group – One of eleven groups within the Operations subdivision of the SEC’s Division of Corporation
        Finance, each focusing on particular industries that have been assigned to an Assistant Director’s office.

   f) Base taxonomy version,
   g) Filing agent,
   h) By financial statement (e.g., Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow, Other Comprehensive Income and Notes – data would only be drawn
      from the selected type of financial statement),
   i) Accession number, and,
   j) Name of filer.

2) The system should be able to produce the following reports:
   a) Elements used – A report on the number and type of the elements used in each instance document or across multiple instance documents. It is
      preferable that the system categorize information in this report by type of financial statement, element metadata, and other criteria.

   b) Custom Elements used –
       i. Custom Element Listing - A report listing all custom elements used. The product should be able to further sort and constrain this
          report by XBRL and US GAAP data type: monetary, string, text block, etc.
          1. The report should contain information on the custom elements including attributes such as data type, xbrli:periodType,
             xbrli:balance, and preferred documentation label (if it exists).
          2. The report should group these custom elements by parent element defined in the calculation or presentation linkbases so SEC staff
             can determine where filers are extending.  NOTE: SEC staff may run this report across one filer or multiple filers.
      ii. Extension rate – A report that shows the use of custom elements in a filing or set of filings.  Measurements can include a percentage
          amount of custom elements, which would be calculated by dividing custom elements over total elements used (Extension rate = custom
          elements used divided by total elements used).
          1. This report could show extension rates in multiple ways (e.g., individual filer, an average for all filers that use the 2009 US GAAP
             taxonomy, or all filers for a Form 10-Q from a particular period).
          2. The report should have full details of the filer name, date and form type and a live link to the source documents.

   c) Negative facts –
       i. A report of all monetary facts with a numeric value less than zero for one or more filings. For example, a report of all facts less
          than zero in filings submitted during the period from September 30, 2009 to November 15, 2009.  The report should contain full details
          of the filer name, date and form type of the filing, and a live link to the documents.
      ii. The End User Product should be able to further constrain the report by interactive data type - monetary, string, text block, etc.
     iii. The report should contain information on the custom elements, including attributes such as data type, xbrli:periodType, xbrli:balance,
          and preferred documentation label (if it exists).
      iv. The Product should be able to group these custom elements by parent element defined in the calculation or presentation linkbases so
          staff can determine where filers are extending.


          NOTE: Staff may run this report across one filer or multiple filers for particular financial statements (e.g., Balance Sheet).

   d) Negated items –
       i. A report of all negated items for one or multiple filings. The system should break this data into categories by Balance Sheet, P&L,
          Cash Flow, Shareholders’ Equity, and notes to the financial statements.
      ii. Staff may want to search for filings with a particular number of negated items; for example, they may want a report of filings with no
          negated items or a report of filings with more than 20 negated items. This report should have full details of the filer name, date and
          form type, and a live link to the documents.

   e) Calculations  – A report on how well the calculations contained in a calculation linkbase match items reported in an instance document.
      The calculations written into the linkbase may yield facts that differ from those tagged by the filer.
       i. Instance document – based on a single instance document, a report comparing facts tagged by the filer in the instance document to the
          calculations defined by the filer in the calculation linkbase.  The report should highlight differences between the facts, if any, that
          could be errors.

      ii. Multiple instance documents – a report comparing two or more filings and identifying calculation inconsistencies across them.

     iii. Compare calculations to another XBRL filing – a report comparing calculations from multiple filers over time.  For example, compare a
          filer’s current 10-Q to the filer’s 10-Q from a previous period, or compare 10-Qs across industries for the same period.

      iv. Reports should be capable of separating information into financial statement categories, such as Balance Sheet, P&L, Cash Flow,
          Stockholders’ Equity, and Statement of Other Comprehensive Income.


   f) Public Float – A report containing information relating to the public float of one or more filers, extracted from one or more Form 10-Ks.
      The report should include information on amount, when reported, and the measurement date.  The report should draw attention to (i.e. flag)
      any listed figures that are more than a year old.  The report should also flag any filings where public float or common shares are reported
      for separate share classes (A, B, etc.).

   g) Label search – a search for a text string against all filer determined labels used for standard and custom elements.  Searches would allow
      the user to specify exact matches, wildcards, regular expressions, and English stemming matches.
       i. Individual – Based on a search of one filer, a report that lists labels,  the associated standard or custom elements, and the filings
          they were from, sorted by relevance.   The report should identify the label that was used in the search and the same/similar labels
          identified in other filings.  The report should present the standard element or custom element name, filing name, filing type, filing
          date and a live link to the filings identified.

      ii. Group – A report that lists labels based on a search of multiple filers, similar to the search described above.  .
   h) Element report – A report that would provide information on an element selected by a user from the US GAAP Taxonomy.  For example, a report
      on all filers who use Advertising Revenue as a tag.


3) General Functionality for Reports

   a) Statistics - All reports should permit inclusion of standard statistical measures and calculations (e.g., mean, median, mode, standard
      deviation).  All reports should reference and link to filings that meet the criteria.

   b) Data conversion requirement - The data from all reports must be generated as, or easily opened from, Microsoft Office applications for
      further analysis.  Reports should seamlessly integrate with Microsoft Office applications, such as permitting users to save data into an
      Excel spreadsheet and re-run their queries after changing the parameters in Excel.

                                                                 c) ATTACHMENT 1

A.  Intending to be legally bound, _________________, (the “Contractor”) hereby accepts the obligations contained in this Agreement in
consideration of being granted conditional access to SEC confidential and non-public information.  For purposes of this Agreement, “confidential
or non-public information,” is defined as information generated by or in the possession of the SEC that is commercially valuable, trade secret,
market sensitive, proprietary, related to an SEC enforcement or examination matter, subject to privilege, protected by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C.

access to information or materials that the SEC determines in its sole discretion is inappropriate for disclosure to Contractor.

C.  Contractor acknowledges that the SEC Regulation Concerning Conduct of Members and Employees and Former Members and Employees of the
Commission expressly prohibits the improper use and unauthorized disclosure of confidential or non-public information or documents.  See 17

(b)(7) and the terms set forth herein.  Contractor, for itself and its employees, agents, and subcontractors, agrees not to disclose to any
unauthorized person any confidential or non-public documents or information to which Contractor or its employees, agents, or subcontractors have
access in the performance of duties under the underlying Contract.

D.  In accordance with the SEC Regulation at 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(1), the Contractor, for itself and its employees, agents, and
subcontractors, agrees not to engage, directly or indirectly, in any personal business transaction or private arrangement for personal profit
the opportunity for which arises because of performance under the Contract, or that is based upon confidential or non-public information which
the Contractor and its employees, agents, and subcontractors gain in the course of performance under the Contract.

E.  In accordance with the SEC Regulation at 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(7)(i), the Contractor, for itself and its employees, agents, and
subcontractors, agrees not to disclose to any unauthorized person or release in advance of authorization for its release, any confidential or
non-public document or information : (1) protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. §§ 552, 552a, and 552b or any rules or regulations of the SEC;
or (2) in circumstances where the SEC has determined to accord such information confidential treatment, unless the SEC authorizes the disclosure
of such information as provided for under 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(7)(ii).  Confidential and non-public information shall be shared with
authorized persons only on a need-to-know basis.

F.  For purposes of this Agreement, an "unauthorized person" is anyone other than (1) an officer or employee of the SEC, (2) an employee of the
Contractor who has executed a non-disclosure agreement with the SEC under the Contract, (3) an employee of a subcontractor of the Contractor who
has executed a non-disclosure agreement with the SEC under the Contract, and whose employer advises Contractor as such, or (4) any individual
that the Contracting Officer expressly designates as a person authorized to receive the confidential or non-public information at issue.

G.  Contractor acknowledges that other federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to the following, may also prohibit the
disclosure of confidential and non-public information received pursuant to the Contract:  the Government Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. § 1905)

information is an unauthorized person, the Contractor shall request clarification from the Contracting Officer.

I.  The Contractor acknowledges that it has received and read the SEC Regulations 17 C.F.R. § 200.735-3(b)(1) & (b)(7) and has referred any

J.  The Contractor acknowledges that disclosure of confidential or non-public information in violation of this agreement could subject the
Contractor to administrative, civil, or criminal action, as appropriate, under the laws and regulations applicable to the information involved.

and debarment from receiving future federal contracts.  Contractor understands that the United States Government may seek any remedy available

Contract and thereafter with respect to information accessed by Contractor that remains confidential or non-public.

N.  The person signing this Agreement on behalf of Contractor warrants that he or she has the authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf

      A.    Identify if you are registered with the PCAOB.


      B.    Identify any pending civil or criminal investigations of which you are aware by any Federal, State or foreign entities.  Identify
pending civil or criminal investigations by such entities of clients on matters audited or consulted on of which you are aware.
