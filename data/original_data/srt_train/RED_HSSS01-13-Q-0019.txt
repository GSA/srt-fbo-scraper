Past Performance.

Exhibits A & B.



The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror’s Offers demonstrates the success of efforts on current and previous contracts, which are relevant to the SOW in terms of type, scope, complexity, and size. A highly rated Offer will provide relevant experiences from the areas required and will demonstrate a similarity of work to be performed under this effort. The highly rated Offers will also demonstrate the Offeror’s ability to overcome difficulties encountered during performance with minimum impact to the program.



When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the Offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the Offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the Offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the Offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.



Past Performance form, Exhibit A, must be completed and submitted by the Offeror. The Offeror shall send Exhibit B, Past Performance, to the reference(s) to complete. Exhibit B, Questionnaire shall be completed and submitted directly from the rater. Note: Exhibit B will not be accepted from the Offeror.  



Past performance is an indicator of a contractor’s ability to perform satisfactorily on future awards and is a record of contractor’s conformance to specifications, quality conformance, adherence to contract schedules, and commitment to customer satisfaction. Having no past performance shall equal a neutral rating.



The Government may utilize the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at  to evaluate contractor past performance for those contractors having previously performed on a Federal Government contract(s).  PPIRS is a web-enabled, government-wide application that collects quantifiable and narrative contractor past performance information from all Federal contracting agencies and provides a contractor’s previous performance based on Federal Stock Class (FSC) or Product Service Code (PSC).  Offerors must provide information concerning performance in providing services or supplies relevant to the requirement. Contracts similar in nature either completed or currently being performed during the last three years.  Offerors shall describe the relevance of each listed contract to the current solicitation’s requirements.  Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Complete and submit Exhibit A to identify references. 





PART III – Price – Page Limitation: 3

The Offeror’s price Offers must include the Business Name, Solicitation Number, CAGE, CLIN, item description, quantity, unit price, extended total price, and shipping costs. The vendor is requested to provide any discounts that it can to assist the government in obtaining the best value.



The Offeror shall carefully review the SOW and propose all costs that will be necessary for the Offeror to successfully perform the contract.



Any significant inconsistency, if unexplained, raises a fundamental issue of the Offeror’s understanding of the nature and scope of the work required. It also may reflect on the Offeror’s ability to perform the contract within financial restraints and may be cause for not selecting the Offers for award. The burden of proof as to cost/price credibility rests with the Offeror. 



Offeror's price Offers must include a spreadsheet containing the proposed price, broken down by major cost element, for each Contract Line Item Number as follows. Show any price reductions offered. 



The attached (Pricing Spreadsheet) elemental price breakdown is provided as a sample only. It is not intended to imply a required or desired number of labor categories or specify required Other Direct Cost (ODC) categories. It is up to the Offeror to carefully review this solicitation and SOW and propose all costs that will be necessary for the Offeror to successfully perform the contract. 



The spreadsheet must be readable using Excel MS Office 2007. Subcontractor or consultant rates and prices, if applicable, shall be presented in the pricing spreadsheet an attachment to this RFQ.





12.  Evaluation and Award Criteria.



 Evaluation – Commercial Items 



(a)   The Quote submitted in response to this solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth hereunder. It is imperative that Offeror respond directly to each area specified and that adequate and specific information be furnished. The Offeror is urged to ensure that their Offers is submitted on the most favorable terms, since less than their best potential could result in exclusion from further consideration. Assurances of experience, capability or qualifications, without a clear demonstration to support the claim, may adversely influence the evaluation of the Quote. Responses which merely repeat the SOW cannot be considered as being responsive to the requirements of the RFQ.  Significant deficiencies identified in the factors and sub-factors may eliminate a Offers from further consideration.



(b)  The Offers will be reviewed and evaluated to determine compliance with the RFQ and SOW requirements ensuring the Best Value to the Government. 



Evaluation of price will be accomplished separately from the technical evaluation; however, technical Offerss will be compared to the pricing evaluation to determine the overall best value for the government. 



The evaluation factors for award follow with the non price factors being in descending order of importance:



Technical capability

experience

Past performance

Price



The non-price factors (technical capability I, experience II, and past performance III) when combined are significantly more important than Price IV.  If two or more offers are tied with respect to their overall rating, price will be the deciding factor. The Government may award the resulting contract to other than the highest rated Offeror or to the other than lowest priced Offeror.



The Government intends to make award based on initial offers received.  Therefore, a written notice of award or acceptance of an offer furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  



(c)   The Government will use the evaluation criteria as stated for each factor below:



The Government will award a blanket purchase agreement resulting from this solicitation to the responsible contractor whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The estimated performance period is five years from award date. 



(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  



Offers will be evaluated and rated for contract award on the basis of Factors:

I-Technical Capability, II-Program Management, III-Past Performance, and Price-IV;  



The ratings to be applied to the Technical Evaluation are Exceptional (E), Good (G), Acceptable (A), Marginal (M), and Unacceptable (U) with the Past Performance overall rating risk levels consisting of Low Risk (LR), Moderate Risk (MR), High Risk (HR), and Neutral (N).



The Government will evaluate all offers in accordance with the terms of this RFQ and its attachments. Marginal or Unacceptable ratings will be considered to not meet the requirement.



Factor I – Technical Capability.  



The Offeror must demonstrate in their Offers the ability to provide services and deliverables that meets or exceeds the Governments required minimum objectives. Offers will be evaluated on the strength and relevancy to assess the Offeror's understanding of the scope of work and its overall approach in providing the required services and deliverables. Offers will be evaluated to assess the content and completeness of the overall technical approach and responsiveness to the requirements identified in the RFQ. Offers will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the Offeror has technical knowledge, experience, and expertise related to the requirements specified in the SOW using the following elements:





Understanding and Execution:

Provide a discussion of the Offeror’s understanding of the requirements specified in the SOW and its attachments(s) and the Offeror’s ability to execute the requirement.  The Offeror should include a discussion of anticipated difficulties and problem areas, together with potential or recommended approaches for their resolution with an emphasis on risk mitigation. The Offeror should also include the approach for the armor samples.





Factor II – Experience



The Government will evaluate the degree of strength and relevancy of the experience, current and/or past, and skills proposed in regard to the RFQ, SOW, and its attachments.



Staffing:

Describe the skills and size of the proposed staff to perform the requirements specified in the SOW to include security requirements. 



Functional Level:

Expert/intermediate, etc.; Senior/Associate, etc.,





Factor III – Past Performance.  



The Government will evaluate to the extent to which the Offeror’s Offers demonstrates the success of efforts on current and previous contracts, which are relevant to the RFQ in terms of type, scope, complexity, and size. Highly rated Offers will provide relevant experiences from the areas required and will demonstrate a similarity to work to be performed under this effort. The highly rated Offers will also demonstrate the Offeror’s ability to overcome difficulties encountered during performance with minimum impact to the program.



The Offers will be evaluated on its performance under existing and/or recently completed contracts both inside and outside the Federal Government for similar services.  The Government will consider past performance information obtained through source(s) from the Offeror as well as in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).  A neutral rating may be applied to those contractors not having assessments in PPIRS or references for the same or similar requirement.



Past performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which Offerors will be evaluated to determine best value to the government.  Assessment of the Offeror’s past performance will be one means of evaluating the credibility of the Offeror’s Offers, and relative capability to meet performance requirements. Offeror’s past performance will be evaluated to determine how well the Offeror demonstrated compliance with prior contract requirements for work similar in nature to the work described in the SOW.  



The Contracting Officer will seek responses from proposed references to the items found in Exhibit A, Past Performance Form.  In addition, sources such as other customers known to the Government, consumer protection organizations, and others who may have useful and relevant information may be contacted.  Information will also be considered regarding any significant subcontractors and key personnel records.  



Evaluation of past performance is often subjective based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will include a determination of the Offeror’s commitment to customer satisfaction and will include conclusions of informed judgment.  However, the basis for conclusions of judgment will be documented.



Award may be made from the offers without discussions.  However, if discussions are held, Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, if the Offeror has not had a previous opportunity to review the rating.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.



The following four (4) past performance ratings will be used for the rater to assess Exhibit B. The criteria for the different rating levels (i.e., outstanding, satisfactory, marginal and unsatisfactory) are identified in the Past Performance Questionnaire, set forth in Exhibit B to the solicitation. 



A. Quality of Product or Service 

B. Schedule 

C. Business Relations 

D. Management of Personnel



Factor IV - Price.

	

	Price will be evaluated based on the Total Evaluated Price, the sum of all CLIN amounts. Adjustments the Government deems appropriate will be made to include Government costs required to accomplish the Offeror’s proposed approach with the exception of those costs to the Government that are equal across all offers. The proposed unit and total evaluated prices will be evaluated to determine reasonableness. In addition, the price Offers will be evaluated to determine consistency with the Offeror’s technical Offers and to determine a clear understanding of the solicitation requirements. Inconsistencies between the Technical and Price Offers may result in a higher risk rating.







TOTAL OFFERED PRICE. 

Evaluation of price will be accomplished separately from the technical evaluation.  Total offered price will not be a rated factor.  Once the technical Offers have been evaluated, the evaluated technical Offers will then be compared to the price Offers as submitted to determine the best overall value for the Government.  The total offered price will be determined by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirements. An offer may be rejected or not be considered for award if it is materially unbalanced.  An offer is considered to be materially unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less for some deliverables and prices which are significantly higher for other similar deliverables; and/or when discrepancies are present between prices for the basic requirement and prices for the option requirement.

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
