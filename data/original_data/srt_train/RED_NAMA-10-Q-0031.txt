This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; fixed price quotations are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-10-Q-0022 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ), and quotations furnished are not offers.  This request does not commit the government to pay any costs incurred in the preparation of the submission of this quotation or to contract for supplies or services.  Any representations and/or certifications attached to this RFQ must be completed by the vendor.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38 effective February 1, 2010.  COMPETITION: This is an unrestricted procurement, subject to full and open competition.  EVALUATION: The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussions of this procurement. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation.  Award will be made to the offeror whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this award will be obtained through a lowest priced technically acceptable evaluation, based on the lowest life cycle price (see Part B of Enclosure 1).  NARA recognizes that the cost of printers is not simply tied to the hardware itself but also the consumables used during the life cycle of the printer.  For the price evaluation of the printers that are the subject of this RFQ, NARA requires Vendors to provide life cycle pricing to include the price of the printer and the toner cartridges that are to be consumed during the life cycle of the printer.   However, NARA is not obligated to award contract line item (CLIN) 0003 and 0004, as they are option CLINs.  Vendors must provide pricing for each CLIN.  The Government will only accept commercial-off-the-shelf items.  In order to facilitate a comprehensive Government evaluation, itemized technical specifications—that address each enumerated requirement of the Salient Characteristics—MUST be submitted by Vendors quoting Equal items for CLINs 0001 and 0002.  CONTRACT TYPE: The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to award an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract.  This anticipated contract shall be comprised of an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) CLIN that utilizes firm fixed unit prices for the purpose of effectuating orders.  The Government guarantees that it will place orders for, at the very least, the Minimum Quantity for each CLIN with the successful vendor.  The initial order will be placed immediately following award.  NARA may issue additional orders to the successful vendor for 12 consecutive months from date of the IDIQ contract, up to the Maximum Quantity listed.  AFFIRMATION STATEMENTS: Vendors must confirm in their quote that all products quoted meet the Energy Star® or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) energy use requirements.  All items quoted must be IPv6 compliant.  These products comprising this requirement are required to be compliant with Section 508.  Supplies furnished under this RFQ are of domestic origin unless otherwise indicated by vendor.  Vendors must include the Trade Agreement Act (TAA) Country of Production (for each CLIN) in their quotation submissions in order to assist with verification of TAA compliance.  Vendors must complete and return Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices, as well as, Enclosure 2, RFQ Information Sheet, in order for their quotations to be considered.  REQUIREMENTS: F.O.B. Destination pricing is requested for each CLIN, all delivery costs must be included in total firm fixed price.  See Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  Submit pricing in accordance with the directions, tables, and Life Cycle Worksheet for Printer located in Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  See Attachment 2, Salient Characteristics for specifications.  DELIVERY: Packaging must be in a manner that prevents damage to the equipment during shipment.  Delivery must be undertaken during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, unless mutually agreed upon by NARA and the Contractor.

PART B, Life Cycle Cost Worksheet for Printers 



Completion and submission of this worksheet is required.  Failure to submit this worksheet with the quotation will result in rejection of the entire quotation without review.



NARA recognizes that the cost of printers is not simply tied to the hardware itself but also the consumables used during the life cycle of the printer.  For the price evaluation of the printers that are the subject of this RFQ, NARA requires Vendors to provide lifecycle pricing to include the price of the printer and the toner cartridges that are to be consumed during the lifecycle of the printer.  NARA requires refurbished toner cartridges if available and Vendors must clearly indicate whether or not the cartridges are new or refurbished along with the make and model number.  Toner calculations must be based on the number of toner cartridges required to meet this lifecycle demand.  



The low price determination, therefore, will be based on the lowest lifecycle price.  All prices used for this calculation must be prices that the Vendor is willing to honor and as such the prices for the printers and toner will be the prices of the respective CLINs.



CLIN 0001 Printer---The life cycle of this printer is four years with an annual usage rate of 675,000 pages / year for a total usage of 2.7 million pages for the four-year life.





CLIN 0002 Printer---The life cycle of this printer is four years with an annual usage rate of 240,000 pages / year for a total usage of 960,000 pages for the four-year life.  Toner calculations must be based on the number of toner cartridges required to meet this life cycle demand.





ENCLOSURE 2, RFQ Information Sheet

 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for
 Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement
 constitutes the only solicitation; fixed price quotations are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number
 is NAMA-10-Q-0022 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ), and quotations furnished are not offers.  This request does not commit the
 government to pay any costs incurred in the preparation of the submission of this quotation or to contract for supplies or services.  Any
 representations and/or certifications attached to this RFQ must be completed by the vendor.  The solicitation document and incorporated
 provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38 effective February 1, 2010.  COMPETITION: This is an
 unrestricted procurement, subject to full and open competition.  EVALUATION: The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial
 quote without discussions of this procurement. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting
 Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation.  Award will be made to the offeror whose conforming quotation in
 response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this award will be obtained through a lowest priced technically
 acceptable evaluation, based on the lowest life cycle price (see Part B of Enclosure 1).  NARA recognizes that the cost of printers is not
 simply tied to the hardware itself but also the consumables used during the life cycle of the printer.  For the price evaluation of the printers
 that are the subject of this RFQ, NARA requires Vendors to provide life cycle pricing to include the price of the printer and the toner
 cartridges that are to be consumed during the life cycle of the printer.   However, NARA is not obligated to award contract line item (CLIN)
 0003 and 0004, as they are option CLINs.  Vendors must provide pricing for each CLIN.  The Government will only accept commercial-off-the-shelf
 items.  In order to facilitate a comprehensive Government evaluation, itemized technical specifications—that address each enumerated requirement
 of the Salient Characteristics—MUST be submitted by Vendors quoting Equal items for CLINs 0001 and 0002.  CONTRACT TYPE: The National Archives
 and Records Administration (NARA) intends to award an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract.  This anticipated contract shall be
 comprised of an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) CLIN that utilizes firm fixed unit prices for the purpose of effectuating orders.
  The Government guarantees that it will place orders for, at the very least, the Minimum Quantity for each CLIN with the successful vendor.  The
 initial order will be placed immediately following award.  NARA may issue additional orders to the successful vendor for 12 consecutive months
 from date of the IDIQ contract, up to the Maximum Quantity listed.  AFFIRMATION STATEMENTS: Vendors must confirm in their quote that all
 products quoted meet the Energy Star® or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) energy use requirements.  All items quoted must be IPv6
 compliant.  These products comprising this requirement are required to be compliant with Section 508.  Supplies furnished under this RFQ are of
 domestic origin unless otherwise indicated by vendor.  Vendors must include the Trade Agreement Act (TAA) Country of Production (for each CLIN)
 in their quotation submissions in order to assist with verification of TAA compliance.  Vendors must complete and return Enclosure 1, Schedule
 of Prices, as well as, Enclosure 2, RFQ Information Sheet, in order for their quotations to be considered.  REQUIREMENTS: F.O.B. Destination
 pricing is requested for each CLIN, all delivery costs must be included in total firm fixed price.  See Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  Submit
 pricing in accordance with the directions, tables, and Life Cycle Worksheet for Printer located in Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  See
 Attachment 2, Salient Characteristics for specifications.  DELIVERY: Packaging must be in a manner that prevents damage to the equipment during
 shipment.  Delivery must be undertaken during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, unless mutually agreed upon by NARA and the
 Contractor.  Deliveries will be made in accordance with Attachment 1, Delivery Schedule.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 12 consecutive months from date
 of contract.   SUBMISSION OF QUOTATIONS: Two copies of each quotation should be mailed to National Archives and Records Administration (NARA),
 Attention: Evelyn Carter – Contractor Support, 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 3340, College Park, MD 20740-6001 or e-mailed to: evelyn.carter@nara.gov
 . Quotations should be received by 12:00 PM ET on March 29, 2010. Questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing to Ms.
 Evelyn Carter no later than 12:00 PM ET on March 19, 2010 to be considered. Please allow one extra business day for delivery and receipt if
 quotation is sent via e-mail, as the e-mail will need to pass through IT security. Telephonic responses will not be processed.  The following
 clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant firm-fixed price IDIQ contract and associated delivery
 orders: Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal (Aug 1999): The following provision is applicable to CLINs

PART B, Life Cycle Cost Worksheet for Printers

Completion and submission of this worksheet is required.  Failure to submit this worksheet with the quotation will result in rejection of the
entire quotation without review.

NARA recognizes that the cost of printers is not simply tied to the hardware itself but also the consumables used during the life cycle of the
printer.  For the price evaluation of the printers that are the subject of this RFQ, NARA requires Vendors to provide lifecycle pricing to
include the price of the printer and the toner cartridges that are to be consumed during the lifecycle of the printer.  NARA requires
refurbished toner cartridges if available and Vendors must clearly indicate whether or not the cartridges are new or refurbished along with the
make and model number.  Toner calculations must be based on the number of toner cartridges required to meet this lifecycle demand.

The low price determination, therefore, will be based on the lowest lifecycle price.  All prices used for this calculation must be prices that
the Vendor is willing to honor and as such the prices for the printers and toner will be the prices of the respective CLINs.

CLIN 0001 Printer---The life cycle of this printer is four years with an annual usage rate of 675,000 pages / year for a total usage of 2.7
million pages for the four-year life.
