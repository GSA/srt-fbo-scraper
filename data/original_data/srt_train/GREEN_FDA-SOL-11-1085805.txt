      Rockville, MD 20857

The proposals shall clearly be marked as “Response to RFP No.: 1085805 Nonclinical Data Tools and Capabilities”.

Technical Proposals must not make reference to pricing data in order that the technical evaluation may be made strictly on the basis of
technical merit.

Each proposal submitted shall contain copies of the appropriate proposal volume in two formats: pdf (Adobe Acrobat 7.0 or older) and in the
original format (e.g., Word or Excel).  Offerors shall submit documents compatible with Microsoft Office 2003 or earlier.

The Offeror shall certify that each proposal has been checked using the latest version of virus detection software and is virus free. The
certification shall identify the virus detection software and version used.

The FDA will provide Offerors with an opportunity to pose questions to the FDA.  The FDA will review and answer the questions received and
anticipates providing a response within one week of receipt.    Offerors shall submit all questions to Brendan McCarthy via email at
brendan.mccarthy@fda.hhs.gov. The FDA must receive the questions no later than 1:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, July 21, 2011.  FDA will not answer
questions received after this date and time and will not answer questions submitted to individuals other than the named contact.  No phone calls
please.

Period of Validity for Proposals. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its proposal firm until September 30, 2011.


General Technical Proposal Instructions

All text in the body of the proposal shall be black.  The Offeror may choose to use color in graphics or charts for greater clarity. Text in
graphics and charts shall be no smaller than 9-point Arial Narrow, and text in tables shall be no smaller than 9-point Arial. No fonts may be
condensed.

The written Technical Proposal is limited to 25 pages.  Offerors shall use only 8.5 inch by 11 inch (210mm by 297mm) paper, double-spaced pages
with margins no less than one inch on each border and shall number each page consecutively.  FDA prefers that Offerors use Arial 11 font, but
the Offeror may use any legible font that is equal in size to or larger than Arial 11.

analyses derived from the data, for public disclosure or regulatory decision-making.

The Offeror’s proposal should present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan
for achieving the objectives of the scope of work.  Technical proposals shall not merely paraphrase the requirements of the Agency’s scope of
work or parts thereof, or use of phrases such as “will comply” or “standard techniques will be employed.”  The technical proposal must include a
detailed description of the techniques and procedures to be used in achieving the proposed end results in compliance with the requirements of
the Agency’s scope of work.  A successful technical proposal shall have all of the following sections.

    (3) Have a satisfactory performance record (See FAR 9.104-3(b) and Subpart 42.15). A prospective contractor shall not be determined
    responsible or non-responsible solely on the basis of a lack of relevant performance history, except as provided in FAR 9.104-2;


    (4) Have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;

Evaluation of Proposals (Single Award)

Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999)


      Basis for Award:  The Government will award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to  the  responsible  offeror  whose  offer,
      conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, price and other factors  considered.   The
      Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror. The Government also reserves the right to award  an
      order based upon initial offers.
      The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each quotation. Risk is defined as the likelihood that the Government will be
      negatively impacted by the offeror’s failure to meet the technical, management and business factors as listed in this solicitation.

      (a)  General.  In order to determine the offer providing the best value, the following factors and risk assessment will be considered:

      Factor I:        Technical Approach
      Factor II:       Management Approach
      Factor III:      Key Personnel
      Risk Assessment I:     Past Performance

      (1) Technical evaluation factors (factors I, II, and III) are listed in descending order of importance but, when combined, are weighted
      significantly higher than price.  Factors I, II and III will be evaluated adjectivally and categorized as Excellent, Highly Acceptable,
      Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory.

      (2) Past Performance: The Government will evaluate past performance as a risk assessment; not as a weighted technical evaluation factor.
      Past Performance will be given a rating of Exceptional/Very Low Performance Risk, Very Good/Low Performance Risk, Satisfactory/Moderate
      Performance Risk, Marginal/High Performance Risk, Unsatisfactory/Very High Performance Risk, or Neutral.

      (3) Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals, nor does the importance of price bear a linear
      relationship to the technical proposal.  The importance of price in the evaluation for award will increase with the degree of equality in
      the non-price factors of the proposals.

Evaluation of Technical Quotation – Volume 1

      Offerors shall be evaluated based upon the following criteria:

      Factor 1 - Technical Approach (All Subfactors are weighted equally)


      Subfactor 1.1 – Software meets or exceeds required functionality

         • The FDA will evaluate whether the software proposed meets or exceeds all salient functional characteristics described in the SOW


      Subfactor 1.2 – Technical Approach to Overall Contract


         • The FDA will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror demonstrates it understands the requirement, has a logical and cohesive
           approach to providing the services required, and has proposed a labor mix that includes the skill sets necessary to successfully
           accomplish the work in an economic and efficient manner.

Subfactor 1.3 – Technical Approach to Task Order 2

         • The FDA will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror demonstrates it understands the work to be accomplished, has a plan that is
           likely to result in the timely achievement of key milestones and the attainment of overall objectives, understands and has mitigated
           risks associated with the work, and has proposed a labor mix that is likely to be effective and economical.  This shall include a
           comprehensive and effective training plan and timely technical support.

Factor 2: Management Approach


      • The FDA will evaluate the extent to which the Offeror’s proposed management plan provides an efficient and effective organizational
        structure and approach that will enable the offeror to provide the goods and services required in a timely manner.  The FDA will also
        evaluate the extent to which the Offeror demonstrates that it can have staff available for Task Orders.




      A highly rated quotation is one that demonstrates a feasible, efficient and effective management approach.

Factor 3: Key Personnel

      • The FDA will evaluate whether the Offeror proposes personnel that have the experience, education, and knowledge necessary to accomplish
        the objective described in the SOW.


Factor 4: Risk Assessment #1: Past Performance.

      The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offer.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's
      likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. The assessment
      of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of
      contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.


      When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition
      requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the
      offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and
      cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the
      customer.


      The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general
      trends in the offeror's performance.  The Government may rely upon data from sources other than the references submitted by the offeror.


      An offeror without a record of relevant experience or past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available, will
      not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably but will be given a neutral evaluation.

 Price Evaluation



 The Government will evaluate the Contractor’s ability to deliver efficient, low-risk performance at a fair and reasonable price.

The FDA’s evaluation of price realism will consider the extent to which proposed pricing indicates a clear understanding of solicitation
requirements, reflects a sound approach to satisfying those requirements, and is consistent with the approach described in the offeror’s
technical volume. The price realism assessment will consider technical and management risks identified during evaluation of the quote.
Unrealistically low proposed prices (initially or subsequently) may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis
that the offeror either doesn’t understand the requirement or has made an unrealistic quote.  When providing pricing for the requested
products/services use, “Attachment A – Pricing Worksheet” as a guideline. The suggested software quantities and labor hours contained in
“Attachment A – Pricing Worksheet, Base Period tab, Option Period One tab, Option Period Two tab, Option Period Three tab, and Option Period
Four tab” are for evaluation purposes only. Specific requests made by the Government are defined at the Task Order levels which are contained in
the “Attachment A – Pricing Worksheet” tabs labeled “Task Order One” and “Task Order Two”.



 Technical factors, when combined, are significantly more importance when compared to price.  The Government reserves the right to make an award
 to other than the lowest priced offeror.  Technical factors shall be evaluated qualitatively and categorized as Excellent, Very Good,
 Acceptable, Marginal, and Unacceptable in relation to the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.
 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
 requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
 shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
 (c) The overall evaluated price shall be based on the total price of the following –
      1. Offerors pricing for the 30 software licenses requested under Task Order One.
      2. Offerors pricing for the software licenses during the optional years. These software
          licenses are labeled “for evaluation purposes only” in “Attachment A – Pricing
          Worksheet.”
      3. Offerors labor category pricing and hours. These categories are labeled “for evaluation
          purposes only” in “Attachment A – Pricing Worksheet.”
      4. Offerors pricing for Task Order Two (Training and Customer Support).
(d) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

IDIQ Statement of Work

1. Background

Acquiring, storing, managing and presenting nonclinical toxicology data is a fundamental aspect of the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations
regulatory review and research mission. Currently, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) receives nonclinical toxicology study data
primarily in paper or PDF format with a small proportion of the data being submitted in non-standardized format. This study data is in support
of regulatory applications.  CDER recognizes that access to electronic structured scientific data about FDA regulated products will improve
science-based, regulatory decision making.  Furthermore, it is expected that nonclinical data will be increasingly submitted in electronic
standard format as the pharmaceutical and related industries adopt electronic formats and standards for data warehousing and transfer.

In light of this, CDER has been actively engaged in enabling electronic submissions of nonclinical study data, particularly, in the development
and testing of a Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC), Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data (SEND) for the representation
of nonclinical toxicology study data.  In order for CDER reviewers to effectively use electronic study data submissions, automated tools must be
acquired to support reviewer access, manipulation, and visualization of the data.  An automated tool for nonclinical data analysis must be able
to adapt to a variety of formats during the gradual transition from paper/PDF submissions to fully electronic and standardized submissions.

CDER recognizes that the study size and variety of formats that will need to be supported for nonclinical data require robust, innovative tools
and database systems.  It is understood that tools that facilitate better access and analysis for nonclinical toxicology data review will
ultimately lead to safer, more effective and higher quality products in the market.  In light of this, the FDA is seeking an off-the-shelf
software tool(s) that provide nonclinical study data management, analysis, and visualization functionalities, Project Management services to
oversee the integration and implementation of the tools, training tools and services to better equip the end users, and enhancement/development
services to integrate the software with existing FDA applications.  This action will address the requirements described in this Statement of
Work.

2. Software Licenses, Maintenance, and Technical Support

Overall objectives of this statement of work are that the FDA is seeking an off-the-shelf software tool with validation and search/discovery
modules to be used for nonclinical data review. As part of this requirement, the Contractor shall install, maintain, and support a software
tool(s) hosted at the FDA White Oak campus to access, visualize, and analyze nonclinical toxicology data. This tool must provide an integrated
environment that includes a hosting repository, visualization and analysis functions, and search and discovery capabilities.  The software tool
with validation and search/discovery module and data repository will support FDA pharmacologists/toxicologist (P/T) reviewers and statisticians.
 This software tool will be used to help FDA reviewer’s access, visualize, and analyze nonclinical toxicology datasets.  The data repository
will be used for staging and hosting the nonclinical data.  This software tool and data repository will be purchased on a “brand name or equal
to” basis (FAR 52.211-6).  The FDA requests proposal responses from all qualified small business sources capable of providing the following
software products (brand name or equal to) as well as the other products and services outlined in this Request for Quote.  The requested
software shall be “brand name or equal to” the PointCross Nonclinical Study Data Software product.

                                                         FDA Infrastructure Architecture


The architecture for the FDA Development, Test, Pre-Production, and Production Environments is characterized as a “Multi-Zone” architecture with
each zone separated by switches and firewalls to support application systems’ security.  The first or outermost zone—the “Presentation
Zone”—supports web and proxy servers.  The second or middle zone—the “Application Zone”—supports business logic for the applications.  The third
or innermost zone—the “Data Zone”—contains database servers used by the applications.  Additional “Transport Zone” and Management Zone” network
segments support routing into the data center as well as specialized network and management services such as Active Directory, Domain Name
Services (DNS), Backup/ Recovery, and Monitoring.  The following paragraphs describe other zoned regions.


Virtualization is a key characteristic of the FDA TRA.  This architecture leverages virtual server environments and network virtualization
techniques to help the agency operate its computing resources more efficiently.  The Office of Information Management goals for virtualization
are to achieve greater infrastructure cost efficiencies and to provide more agile technology support to the agency and its business partners.
In addition, the FDA requires that communications between different physical and virtual systems are established on an exception-by-exception
basis in accordance with FDA Security Policy.


The terms Zone, Enclave, and Core/Distribution are used throughout the following subsections and are defined as follows:

    • Zone:  A network boundary that provides a physical demarcation between horizontal Extranet/Intranet infrastructure components and vertical
      Presentation, Application, and Data infrastructure components
    • Enclave:  One or more virtual network segments that provide logical demarcation within a zone
    • Core/Distribution:  A common set of dedicated support infrastructure for a zone.


FDA TRA zones and their respective enclaves are supported by dedicated Core/Distribution infrastructure environments, containing redundant
border routers, firewall and other security devices, physical switches, and load balancers.  The redundant load balancers provide Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) and high-availability support.  The dedicated firewalls and other security devices provide a concentration of security services that
include, at a minimum, packet and protocol filtering, information hiding, and audit logging consistent with the FDA Security Policy.


1 FDA Core Network


This section provides a high-level overview of the FDA Core Network.  The FDA Core Network supplies redundant Wide Area Network (WAN)
connectivity among the FDA’s White Oak Data Center (WODC), Contractor Hosted Data Center (CHDC), and Parklawn/PSC Data Centers.  This core
network consists of Internet, HHSnet, and FDAnet WAN components to facilitate redundant, high-speed connectivity among the FDA’s main data
centers.  The components of the FDA Core Network components are as follows:

    • FDA Core Network:  A high-speed, dedicated point-to-point fiber optics network that connects the WODC, CHDC, and Parklawn/PSC data centers
    • Internet:  A high-speed network that provides access to FDA extranet applications via the Internet, or other sources external to the FDA,
      including access to facilitate business functions
    • HHSnet:  A high-speed network that provides access to FDA applications for business partners via the Health and Human Services (HHS)
      network
    • FDAnet:  A high-speed network that provides access to FDA applications for Intranet business partners.


The following subsections provide architectural descriptions for the components that reside inside each of FDA’s main data centers.


2 Multi-Zone Architecture Overview


This subsection presents general architectural guidelines for all of the FDA data centers.  Subsections 2.3 and 2.4, respectively, address the
WODC and CHDC.


1 Presentation, Application, and Data Zones


The FDA TRA supports the Presentation, Application, and Data Zones and their specific access requirements and protections to support the needs
for customers of each zone.  Each FDA Development, Test, Pre-Production, and Production Environment employs these three zones to separate user
and application connectivity for security purposes.  The major drivers for the FDA TRA implementation are to:

    • Provide a reliable, standardized, secure computing environment for FDA applications
    • Provide the necessary control to implement policy and requirements changes so FDA can comply with executive mandates, statutes, and
      regulations on a timely basis
    • Enhance interaction with the FDA Development, Test, Pre-Production, and Production Environments by providing standard interfaces for
      entities that access FDA applications and data.


The FDA Multi-Zone Architecture consists of four main groups of Extranet and Intranet infrastructure components: the Transport Zone, Production
& Pre-Production Zones, Development & Test Zones, and the Management Zone.


The Zones are comprised of Extranet and Intranet Presentation, Application, and a common Data Zone that separate user, application, and database
connectivity to ensure security defense-in-depth.  The common Data Zone hosts database environments that support both Extranet and Intranet
Application Zone connectivity.  Extranet and Intranet Application Zone-to-Data Zone connectivity leverage their respective Data Zone
Core/Distribution environment for primary communications.  When required, Extranet and Intranet Data Zone communications are supported via cross-
connected network paths between the Extranet and Intranet Data Zone Core/Distribution environments.  The use of these Data Zone cross-connects
is highly restricted and is avoided wherever possible.  The FDA TRA – Core Infrastructure Services Supplement, Version 1.0 provides
implementation guidance for the specific Core/Distribution solutions deployed in each of the zones.


1 Presentation Zone


The Presentation Zone is the first physical zone supported by one or more enclaves.  The Presentation Zone controls how users and applications
interface with FDA Development, Test, Pre-Production, and Production Environments.  The Presentation Zone separates the user or end-application
from the Application and Data Zones.  This separation provides the first layer of security for the FDA Development, Test, Pre-Production, and
Production Environments.  All screen forms and Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are located in the Presentation Zone.


The Presentation Zone contains the web pages for Extranet and Intranet websites and all web servers.  The Presentation Zone servers contain
presentation logic (HTML) for websites containing static content.  No application/business/database logic/processing is executed on servers in
the Presentation Zone.  All support applications, business logic, databases, tables, and sensitive information for the FDA Extranet and Intranet
applications reside on dedicated servers in the Application Zone and the Data Zones.


The Presentation Zone is supported by redundant load balancers to ensure high availability.  Redundant, external Domain Name Services also
reside in the Extranet Presentation Zone to provide name resolution for external-facing applications.


2 Application Zone


The Application Zone resides below the Presentation Zone and contains application servers.  This separation ensures that connectivity from the
Internet, HHSnet, and FDAnet must traverse the Presentation Zone before connecting to the Application Zone.  The Application Zone controls the
operation of application-specific business functionality.  These application-specific business functions include data validation, execution of
business rules, calculations, manipulation of data, and control of the environment.  When an Application Zone application requires information
or actions from the Data Zone, the application makes the request and processes the response.  Business results from the Application Zone are
then returned to the Presentation Zone and formatted by the Presentation Zone for delivery to the end user or application for viewing or further
processing.  In addition, load balancers are available for applications that have high-availability, load-balanced traffic requirements.


3 Data Zone


The common Data Zone resides below the Application Zone and contains all data access logic and data sources, including data warehouses and data
marts as well as operational databases for applications.  All information to be stored in the Data Zone comes through the Application Zone.  The
Data Zone interfaces with the Application Zone and is separated from the Presentation Zone for security purposes.


2 Transport Zone


The Transport Zone is composed of router and switch infrastructure for the sole purpose of managing and controlling network traffic.  The
external sources of network traffic destined for FDA Development, Test, Pre-Production, and Production Environments are the Internet, HHSnet,
and FDAnet Networks.  Both inbound and outbound Internet, HHSnet, and FDAnet traffic are governed by discrete stacks of border routers, physical
switches, and security devices.  In addition, connectivity between FDAnet and HHSnet traverse the Transport Zone.  All connectivity to and from
the Presentation and Management Zones traverses the Transport Zone.


3 Management Zone


The Management Zone provides network and security, monitoring, and management in support of all other Zones and also hosts redundant firewalls,
security devices and physical switches.  All network traffic destined for this Zone is routed by redundant border routers, physical switches,
and security devices.  The Management Zone is separated into functional areas that support a high level of availability, integrity, and
accountability for all data center management in support of FDA applications.  Security, backup, and management services for all servers in the
Presentation, Application, and Data Zones are provided via an out-of-band network.


3 White Oak Data Center Architecture


1 White Oak Infrastructure Architecture


The White Oak Data Center (WODC) provides support for the FDA’s Development & Test environments as well as Pre-Production and Production support
for file and print services.  Figure 2 depicts the WODC Infrastructure Architecture.


                                                                      [pic]
                                                 Figure 2.  FDA WODC Infrastructure Architecture


Each of the WODC Presentation, Application, and Data Zones, as well as their supporting enclaves, has the following characteristics:

    • Core/Distribution infrastructure support that includes dedicated, redundant firewalls, switches, and optional load balancers, with the
      exception of the Data Zone, to ensure consistent and scalable infrastructure services for applications that are deployed into each Zone
    • Separation into their own virtual server environments to ensure accommodation of their individual configuration and access needs
    • Common server hardware support wherever possible for each application deployment in the Zone enclaves.


The following subsections present additional description of the functionality and architectural deployment guidelines for each of the
environments depicted in Figure 2.


2 Development & Test Zones


The WODC Development & Test Zones (Zones 4 and 5 as shown in Figure 2), are supported by common physical server hardware where possible.
Virtual server environments are provided to support application development and testing needs.  The FDA has constructed the Intranet Development
& Test environments (Zones 4c and 4d as shown in Figure 2) and will do so for Extranet Development & Test environments (Zones 4a and 4b as shown
in Figure 2) as business needs arise.


The WODC Development & Test Data Zone (Zone 5 as shown in Figure 2) Core/Distribution infrastructure serves as the primary communications path
to and from the Intranet Application Zone.  Intranet database deployments into this Data Zone are supported by specific Intranet database server
hardware where necessary.


3 Production & Pre-Production Zones


The WODC Production & Pre-Production Zones (Zones 1 and 2 as shown in Figure 2) are supported by common physical server hardware where possible.
 Virtual server environments are provided to support production application needs.  The FDA has constructed the Intranet Production environments
(Zones 1c and 1d as shown in Figure 2) to support File and Print services and will construct the Intranet Pre-Production, Extranet Production &
Pre-Production environments (Zones 1c, 1d, 1a, and 1b as shown in Figure 2) as business needs arise.


The WODC Production & Pre-Production Data Zone (Zone 2 as shown in Figure 2) Core/Distribution infrastructure serves as the primary
communications path to and from the Intranet Application Zone and the Management Zone.  Intranet database deployments into this Data Zone are
supported by specific intranet database server hardware where necessary.


The FDA has also designed support for a future WODC Legacy Zone (Zone 1e as shown in Figure 2) in the event an FDA application cannot be
accommodated by the existing Multi-Zone architecture.  FDA requires executive management approval from the CIO, CTO, and CISO as well as funding
plans before this Legacy Zone can be constructed.


4 Contractor Hosted Data Center Architecture


1 CHDC Infrastructure Architecture


The Contractor Hosted Data Center, also known as the Ashburn Data Center, provides support for the FDA’s main Production and Pre-Production
environments.  The CHDC and WODC data centers adhere to the same multi-zone architecture and are scaled according to their specific computing
requirements.  As depicted in Figure 3, the CHDC is a lights-out data center facility that is managed and monitored remotely.  In addition, no
direct Internet connectivity is allowed to the CHDC Management Zone in accordance with FDA Security Policy.


                                                                      [pic]
                                                 Figure 3.  FDA CHDC Infrastructure Architecture


The following subsection presents a description of the functionality and architectural deployment guidelines for each of the environments
depicted in Figure 3.


2 Production & Pre-Production Zones


The CHDC Production & Pre-Production Zones (Zones 1 and 2 as shown in Figure 3) are supported by separate physical server hardware, and virtual
server environments are provided to support production application needs.  The FDA has constructed the Production & Pre-Production Extranet and
Intranet environments to support most, if not all, FDA production application deployments.  The FDA intends to utilize the Pre-Production Zone
for validation of application release packages, user acceptance testing, application stress testing and other forms of operational testing prior
to an application release to the Production Zone.  The Production Zone hosts the FDA’s main production applications including training
environments.


Each of the CHDC Production & Pre-Production Extranet and Intranet Presentation, Application, and common Data Zones (Zones 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, and 2
as shown in Figure 3), as well as their supporting enclaves, have the following characteristics:

    • Core/Distribution infrastructure support that includes dedicated redundant firewalls, switches, and optional load balancers to ensure
      consistent and scalable infrastructure services for applications that are deployed into each Zone
    • Separate physical server hardware support each Zone
    • Separation into their own respective virtual server environments to ensure accommodation of individual performance, configuration, and
      access needs
    • Common server hardware support wherever possible for application deployments into each of the Production & Pre-Production Zone enclaves.


Each of the CHDC Production & Pre-Production Extranet and Intranet Data Zone (Zone 2 as shown in Figure 3) Core/Distribution infrastructures
serve as the primary communications path to and from their respective Extranet and Intranet Application Zones.






                                                           Core Infrastructure Services


Core Infrastructure Services are those services that fundamentally support applications in the FDA Development, Test, Pre-Production, and
Production Environments to facilitate communications and core tasks.  The Core Infrastructure Services referenced in this section are designed
to ensure technical interoperability between the FDA’s Development, Test, Pre-Production, and Production environments across FDA data centers.
The Infrastructure Services described here were defined, specified, and agreed to by FDA OIM technical and management leadership in
collaboration with the FDA’s ICT21 data center contractors.  The FDA TRA – Core Infrastructure Services Supplemental documentation provides
specific engineering implementation details related to the FDA Core Infrastructure Services.

maintenance of Configuration Management Database (CMDB) Design, Change Management Processes, and Release Management Processes.






                                                           Common Application Services


The FDA Development, Test, Pre-Production, and Production Environments employ Common Application Services (also referenced as “Tech Stacks” or
Application Reference Architectures) for direct support of applications to facilitate communications and common tasks for business logic.  The
Common Application Services described in this section are designed to ensure technical interoperability, high availability, scalability, proper
resource management, and application co-location support when deployed in the FDA’s Development, Test, Pre-Production, and Production
environments.  The FDA Centers, OIM technical and management leadership, and the FDA’s data center contractors have collaborated in defining and
specifying the Common Application Services reference architectures described in this section.  This list of Common Application Services is not
exhaustive.  OIM, with support from the Centers, will define additional reference architectures in the future to support FDA application
business needs.  The FDA TRA – Common Application Services Supplemental document provides specific engineering implementation details related to
these services.


1 Oracle Application Server (Java EE)


The Oracle Application Server (Java EE) Reference Architecture leverages fully redundant components at each layer.  Presentation and Application
Zone server instances are load balanced and actively monitored for failures.  As individual application load increases or additional
applications are introduced to the Oracle Application Server (Java EE) environment, Presentation and Application Zone server instances are
deployed to provide horizontal scaling.  Individual applications are isolated at a resource level by deploying them into separate Oracle
Application Server (Java EE) instances or separate virtual server instances.  The Oracle Application Server (Java EE) Management Server monitors
Oracle Application Server (Java EE) server instances and provides performance reporting and alerting.  Multiple applications reside in the
shared Oracle Application Server (Java EE) environment.  Each application receives at least two (2) dedicated Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) and
Oracle Application Server (AS) instances allocated on separate virtual server instances.  OHS and Oracle AS may host more than one (1)
Presentation Zone or Application Zone server instance respectively.


2 Oracle Application Server (Forms and Reports)


The Oracle Application Server (Forms and Reports) Reference Architecture leverages fully redundant Application Zone server components.
Application server instances are load balanced and actively monitored.  Application server instances are also clustered and configured with
session replication to provide seamless failover between application server instances.  As individual application load increases or additional
applications are introduced to the Application Server instances, the deployment uses standard virtual machine templates to provide horizontal
scaling.  Individual applications are isolated at a resource level by deploying them into separate Oracle Application Server (Java EE) instances
or separate virtual server environments.  The Oracle Application Server (Java EE) Management Server monitors Oracle Application Server (Java EE)
server instances and provides performance reporting and alerting.  Multiple applications reside in the shared Oracle Application Server
environment.  Each application will receive at least two (2) dedicated Oracle HTTP Server (OHS) and Oracle Application Server instances
allocated on separate nodes.


3 Apache Web Server and Tomcat


The Apache Web Server and Tomcat Reference Architectures leverage fully redundant components at each layer.  The servers contain high-
availability agents that monitor databases to ensure that all databases are online and required services as well as the Apache Web Server/Tomcat
servers are running.  As individual server loads increase or new Apache web server instances are introduced to the Presentation Zone, additional
cluster nodes can be added to Apache web server clusters to increase resources available to provide computing power for additional instances.
Individual Apache Web Server and Apache Tomcat instances are isolated at a resource level by deploying them into separate instances.  Multiple
applications can use the same web server environment.


4 ASP.NET and Internet Information Server


The ASP.NET and Internet Information Server (IIS) Reference Architectures leverage fully redundant components at each layer.  As individual
server loads increase or new IIS server instances are introduced for both static and dynamic websites, additional instances are added to
increase computing resources.  Individual IIS instances are isolated at a resource level by deploying them into separate instances.  Resource
management is performed using Microsoft Management Console (MMC).  Multiple applications can use the same web server environment.


5 Business Objects


The Business Objects Reference Architecture leverages fully redundant components at each layer.  Business Objects server instances are load
balanced externally and actively monitored for failures.  Business Objects server instances are also clustered at the application level and
configured with session replication to provide seamless failover between application server instances.  As individual application loads increase
or the concurrent usage is increased, quick vertical scaling is achieved by adding additional Business Objects services.  In addition, new
application servers are added to the current Business Objects cluster to provide horizontal scaling.  Business Objects will provide reporting
services to multiple applications from a single, consolidated enterprise instance.


6 ColdFusion


The ColdFusion Reference Architecture leverages fully redundant components at each layer.  Presentation and Application Zone server instances
are load balanced and actively monitored for failures.  Application Zone server instances are also clustered and configured with session
replication to provide seamless failover between application server instances.  As individual application loads increase or additional
applications are introduced to the ColdFusion environment, Presentation and Application Zone server instances are deployed from standard virtual
machine templates to provide horizontal scaling.  Individual applications are isolated at a resource level by deploying them into separate
ColdFusion server instances or separate virtual servers.  The ColdFusion Management Server monitors ColdFusion server instances and provides
performance reporting and alerting.  Multiple applications can reside in the shared ColdFusion environment.  Each application receives at least
two (2) dedicated IIS web sites and ColdFusion instances allocated on separate virtual server instances.  IIS Web Server and ColdFusion
Application Servers may host more than one (1) IIS site or ColdFusion application server instance respectively.


7 Documentum


The Documentum Reference Architecture leverages fully redundant components at each layer.  Documentum provides distributed architecture and
clustering capabilities capable of Active/Active and Active/Passive configurations.  Load balancing Documentum Content Server requests are
achieved by configuring each Content Server to broadcast the same proximity value to each available Docbroker.  The Docbroker randomizes
connection requests across available Content Servers, providing seamless access if one Content Server or Docbroker are rendered unavailable.
Multiple Rendition Servers and Index Servers are configured against the same Documentum repository, providing increased availability if one of
the hosts becomes unavailable.  As individual application loads increase or additional applications are introduced to the Documentum Application
Server environment, Documentum Application Server instances are deployed from standard virtual machine templates to provide horizontal scaling.
As needed, additional Documentum Content Servers, Rendition Servers, and Index Servers are introduced to the environment and leveraged to
accommodate increased user load.  Documentum Content Server installations host multiple repositories for different application needs.
Documentum Index Servers and Rendition Servers are configured against multiple repositories, which increase economies of scale and reduce the
Agency server footprint.  Additional applications residing within the same Documentum environment are logically isolated and function
independently of one another.


8 Microsoft SQL Server


The Microsoft SQL Server Reference Architecture leverages fully redundant components at each layer.  Microsoft SQL Server contains high-
availability agents that monitor databases to ensure that all databases are online and required services are running.  As individual database
load increases or new database instances are introduced to the SQL Server environment, additional cluster nodes are added to SQL Server clusters
to increase resources available to database instances and provide computing power for additional instances.  Individual SQL Server instances are
isolated at a resource level by deploying them into separate instances within a database server.  The SQL Server Management Studio monitors SQL
Server instances and provides performance reporting, alerts, and notifications.  Performance monitoring and alerting are also performed on
databases in clustering environments.  Databases for multiple applications can reside in the same SQL Server environment.
