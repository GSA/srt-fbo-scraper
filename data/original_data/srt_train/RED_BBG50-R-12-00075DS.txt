STATEMENT OF WORK

General Information
The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) is seeking a tag management tool to manage web analytics tags and to enable the BBG to easily and consistently roll out other javascript tag based products on specific websites for all of US International Media (USIM). The BBG’s initial purposes for this tag management tool are: 

To aid in implementing a new web analytics tool and unified tagging structure across all BBG websites and to facilitate accurate and complete tagging.

To decrease, where possible, the impact of web analytics and other tags on our page load time. 

To be able to stand up new web analytics tools quickly and on whatever subset of sites is relevant, especially to try new tools or modify existing ones.

To make it simple to customize tags on specific site sections or pages to get as much information as needed from online measurement and analysis tools.

Problem Statement
BBG is seeking a tag management tool to manage and optimize 3rd party code snippets across all USIM websites, mobile sites, and mobile applications. The tag management tool shall manage tags including, but not limited to: analytics, surveys, widgets, marketing campaigns, chat, conversion tracking, a/b testing, events.  The tag management tool shall make it easy specify a site section or page where certain tag or tag element should be placed. 


Scope of USIM
USIM has a growing digital media footprint across five international news networks which include 100+ news channels targeting audiences worldwide.  This includes 100+ public facing news websites in 60+ languages, with about 25 million page views weekly and about 1.25 billion page views annually.  These websites generated between 32 million and 45 million visits monthly over the past year. Mobile versions of the websites are also available, and account for an additional 1.5 million page views weekly and 60 million page views annually, and more than 3 million visits monthly.  USIM currently supports a few iOS and Android mobile applications, but we will have more in the future.


USIM is comprised of five networks. Please visit the sites referred below for the most up-to-date list of websites and domains:



Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (includes all sites listed here:  - click on “Sites by Language” on the top left corner of the page)

Radio & TV Marti - 

Radio Free Asia (includes all sites listed here:  - websites are linked in the grey nav bar across the top of the page)

Alhurra /Radio Sawa –  and  

Voice of America (includes all sites listed here: http://www.insidevoa.com/about/faqs/  - scroll down to “In 43 Languages”)



USIM is currently in transition from 5 core content management systems to 1-3 core content management systems (CMS). Many USIM sites are moving to the same .NET based CMS that has been developed in-house and is supported fully by USIM.  Some sites may remain on .NET or Plone. Additionally, USIM uses self-hosted Wordpress for blogs and smaller websites. USIM uses one additional CMS for mobile optimized websites.


Core users:
USIM has several offices and individuals vested in tagging and analytics. There is one central technical office for all website management (based in Prague) and a group of web analysts spanning the organization (DC area and Prague) who will need access to the tag management tool and administrator-level training. There are also inbound marketing groups, developers, and content creators who may need to tag individual projects or to configure or add additional tools through the tag management tool.


Initial use: 
The initial setup of the tag management tool will be to apply a new web analytics (unknown) to all BBG sites. A detailed explanation of the setup requirements for the new web analytics tool can be found in Appendix A.  


Additionally, this tool will be used to manage Facebook, Twitter, Google and Bing webmaster authentication tags on all websites.


Future uses:
Some future use cases for adding tags to the site include: 

Onsite surveys or web-based usability testing.

A/B or multivariate testing.

Marketing campaign conversion tracking.

Small-scale web analytics tool implementation or trials on certain sites.

Small-scale launch of chat, poll, or other widget-based technology.

Unique challenges:
USIM’s digital audience comes through high-speed Internet connections in some countries and from dial-up connections in others. Many users access USIM content through mobile optimized websites using devices ranging from WAP flip phones to 4G smart phones. An ideal web analytics tool will be able to organize traffic by device (mobile, desktop, tablet – and their respective brands and models), and will have a rigorous method for tracking  or accounting for visits that come through less advanced technology, including dial-up, browsers that do not run javascript or do not accept cookies, WAP phones, etc.


As an organization, the BBG works in 60 languages using UTF-8 fonts. USIM content is produced in all 60 of these languages, and a tag management tool shall support these languages used as elements of tags (the title of an article, the keyword that was searched, other tags, etc.) or input via the tag management tool.   It is not required that a tool have a user interface in these languages.  A complete list of our languages is in Appendix 2.


Period and place of performance
The tag management service will be a 12-month base period from the effective date of award (i.e. July 1, 2012 – June 30, 2013), with (4) one-year option periods. Kickoff meeting and technical training may be held at BBG headquarters in Washington, DC. All other work is to be performed at the Contractor’s facility unless specified and approved by the Contracting Officer.


Deployment Schedule and Deliverables
Within 7 days of award: 

All licensing or provisioning of tool is complete and BBG technical implementation team has access to the tool and documentation. 

A Kick-Off meeting with the Contractor bringing key personnel (Contractor’s project manager/representative, lead technical staff and lead translation manager) to a meeting at BBG. – To be scheduled with Contracting Officer.

Within 10 days of contract award: 

Delivery dates set with Contracting Officer. This tag management tool will be used in the initial deployment of a web analytics tool contracted at the same time. As such, initial setup, technical training, and tag configuration delivery deadlines will be coordinated with the web analytics deployment schedule. – To be scheduled with Contracting Officer, in coordination with Web Analytics tool provider, BBG implementation lead, and COR.

Weekly, after Kick-Off meeting:

During implementation – Weekly call with implementation lead and COR on the status of implementation and setup of tag management tool. To be scheduled with the COR each week

After implementation – weekly call with COR on the status and performance of tool. To be scheduled with COR each week.

Optional line items: 
BBG’s initial deployment of a tag management tool will fulfill basic needs, as outlined in the problem statement above. However, over the lifetime of this project, the BBG may seek additional technical or professional services. As such, please provide any recommended services or add-ons as optional line items in the proposal, including, but not limited to, the following:

Professional services and training for initial implementation

Additional professional services and training

Professional services and training for additional tools (ie. Adding a different type of tag after initial implementation)

24/7 support

Standard (business hours) support

Auxiliary or add-on tools to supplement core proposed tool

Based on 80-100 websites, we recommend _____.
