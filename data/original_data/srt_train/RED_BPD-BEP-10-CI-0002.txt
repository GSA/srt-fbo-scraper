II.  PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT


                                                       The Bureau of Engraving and Printing
                                                       Performance-Based Statement of Work
                                                            Computer Training Services


      Background

The Bureau of Engraving & Printing (BEP) is a component of the Department of the Treasury that designs, engraves, and prints U.S. currency, and
other security products. The BEP has approximately 1,400 employees in Washington, DC and approximately 600 employees in Ft. Worth, Texas.  The
Bureau of Engraving and Printing is a white and blue collar manufacturing organization.  The BEP operates 24-hours a day, seven days a week. The
BEP’s Year End Shutdown period typically will occur from  December 25th through January 1st each year, therefore no deliveries of materials will
be accepted during this time.

2.0     Mission
The BEP-Center for Excellence (BEP-CE) objective is to assist the workforce in adapting to new technologies, and to add to the productivity of
the BEP through promoting an atmosphere of personal growth and development. The BEP-CE goal is that these varied learning opportunities will
enrich BEP employees' careers and promote organizational excellence.

3.0   Scope of Work
Services to be provided under this Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) consist of the following:

    • Instructional services for off-the-shelf computer training courses for BEP's diverse workforce located in Washington, DC and Ft. Worth, TX.



    • Books, manuals, workbooks, tools, materials, etc. in support of the training.

It is anticipated that each course will be offered at least once or twice a year to BEP employees located in Washington, DC or Ft. Worth, TX
and/or both.  The tentative 2010 Training Calendar can be viewed in ATTACHMENT C.  This schedule is subject to change depending on the needs of
BEP.  There are 29 courses anticipated to be offered on the tentative 2010 training calendar January through December, 2010 which can be found
in ATTACHMENT C.  Courses listed in January through April are currently or in process of being awarded, however it is anticipated that these
courses will be offered in the subsequent years of the BPA. The objectives for each of these courses are listed in ATTACHMENT D.  It is
anticipated that each course will be offered at least one time to BEP employees located in Washington, DC or Ft. Worth, TX and/or both, however
different course offerings may be offered to meet the specific needs of BEPs employees.

This acquisition will result in an award of one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for a period of 5 years. Funding for each subsequent
year is contingent upon the availability of funds, the satisfactory performance, and the agreement of both parties to continue with the joint
effort.

In order to support the mission of the BEP-CE, the BEP is seeking a contractor(s) to provide the necessary training to support an environment of
continuous learning and development.  The contractor shall be required to provide training at all levels of the organization.  The contractor
shall provide all personnel and materials required to perform training to the BEP in accordance with the terms and conditions of this BPA.

The BEP-CE posts the available courses at the start of each fiscal year and the courses offered typically vary depending upon circumstances and
interest.

The BEP-CE offers a variety of information technology skills training.  The training is conducted at the BEP and shall be conducted in the
learning laboratory and contain specific instruction on various commercial off-the shelf software packages.  The vendor shall have contractors
who can provide training in both the Washington, DC area and Ft. Worth, TX area.   The number of participants will vary depending on the
location of the training.  Typically, the minimum/maximum class size will be 10/18 students at the Washington, DC facility and 6/12 in Ft.
Worth, TX.  The following courses identified below shall be off-the-shelf courses available in both the 2003 and 2007 versions and offered at
the introductory, intermediate and advanced levels.

4.1   Course Materials and Supplies
The contractor shall provide course materials for each session, specific to the course being presented.  The BEP's Year End Shutdown period is
typically from December 25th through January 1st of each year, therefore no deliveries of materials will be accepted during this time.  The
contractor may be requested to prepare training at the 8th grade level or below.  The materials shall include certificates of completion, course
evaluations, videotapes, workbooks, handouts, agendas and other instructional tools.  The Contractor is responsible for presenting these

are taken collectively.  A reasonable expectation for any course is a collective evaluation score between an 85 and a 100.

The COTR shall provide a list of all participants to the contractor prior to the course start date for preparation and distribution of
certificates of completion.  Each student shall receive a Certificate of Completion. Certificates and evaluations shall be distributed at the
close of the last class for each session.

Contractor service requirements are summarized into performance objectives that relate directly to the mission essential items.  The performance
threshold briefly describes the minimum acceptable levels of service required for each requirement.  These thresholds are critical to mission
success.  The Government may use various methods to monitor performance, including regular or random attendance at the training, training
evaluation forms, and customer complaints.

standards and applicable BPA call references.

2.0 Ordering Procedures under the Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA)


      a.  Order of Precedence
      All BPA calls are subject to the terms and conditions of the BPA.  In the event of conflict between a BPA call   and the BPA, the BPA will
take precedence.








      b.  Ordering Officials
      Only warranted Contracting Officers are allowed to place orders against the awarded BPA(s).  BPA calls will be   solicited and awarded by
the Government only through the designated Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer  reserves the right to request additional discounts.

      c.  Single Award BPA Orders
      BPA calls will be directed to the successful BPA contract holder.


      d.  Multiple Award BPA Orders:  Under $3,000
      BPA calls estimated at or below Micro-purchase Threshold of $3,000.00 will be rotated between the BPA contract holders.


      e.  Multiple Award BPA Orders:  Above $3,000
      BPA calls estimated above Micro-purchase Threshold of $3,000.00 will be competed between all BPA contract holders for that service area.


      f.  Purchase Limitations.
      The amount of any one purchase under this agreement shall not exceed $100,000.00.


     g. BPA Call Issuance Procedures
      When services are required, the BPA Administrative Contracting Officer will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP).  A call specifies and
      authorizes work to be accomplished by the Contractor to satisfy Government task requirements.  The calls issued under this BPA will not be
      synopsized.  All calls will be issued by The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP).  The Government intends to place calls at a firm fixed
      price.  The Government will specify the following, at a minimum, in each BPA Call scope:


            A.  Scope of Work that shall include at a minimum the following:
                 (1)   Contractor BPA number
                 (2)   A description of the work to be performed/course to be provided
                 (3)   Start and end dates of each training course
                 (4)   Travel requirements, if any
                 (5)   Government Furnished Equipment, Materials, Information/Data,
                       and/or Facilities being provided
                    6) Security, technical or environmental requirements, if applicable.
                    7) Additional Invoicing and Payment procedures, if applicable.
           B.  Due date of the proposal

      h.  Task Proposal
      The Contractor shall provide a written response to the RFP within the required timeframe as specified in the RFP. The Contractor’s written
      response shall consist of the following:


           1) A technical proposal that specifies the Contractor’s approach to performing the required work.
           2) A firm-fixed price proposal for the required work to be performed.  If travel is required, any travel estimate shall be priced in
           accordance with FAR 31.205-46.  Prices shall be reasonable and Contractor shall itemize transportation, lodging, and meal charges.
           The Contractor shall also include any other direct costs associated with material or shipping costs.


      i.  Proposals
      Contractors should be allowed adequate time to prepare price proposals for each BPA call.  Contracting Officers are    encouraged to
confirm requirements with contractors if proposals are not in line with the Government Estimate       for the work.  The costs for preparation
of BPA call proposals shall be the responsibility of the contractor and not    directly reimbursable.  Proposals will be evaluated on a lowest
price technically acceptable basis unless the request    for proposal specifies otherwise.  In the event that a proposal will be evaluated on a
best value basis, the instructions      to Offerors will be provided and the method of evaluation will be described at the time the call is
made.


      j. Award and Commencement of Work/Notice to Proceed
      No work under this contract will commence until the Contracting Officer issues a written  BPA call, which will   be considered the
official Notice to Proceed.  Award of the BPA call will be executed by a written BPA call signed      by the Contracting Officer.  BPA calls
will be firm fixed price     and clearly define the course requirements and    services to be performed.  The Government reserves the right to
execute a BPA call award without  discussions.  The contractor shall respond to confirm acceptance of the BPA call within two days of receipt of
the   BPA call.

      k.  Terms and Conditions
      Neither party shall be responsible for any failure of performance due to Acts of God, war, disaster, strikes, accidents     or governmental
acts that make performance impossible.  Acts of God are covered, though weather is only   considered covered when the Federal and State
Departments of Transportation, as well as local police   departments (within the geographical area of the Washington, DC and/or Ft. Worth, TX
locations   consider the roads    not passable.  This includes any airline flight cancellations due to inclement weather.  This applies in the
event of    snow and/or ice in all from this event.

      l.  Cancellation Policy

BEP.

      Delivery of services under this BPA will be evaluated based on the deliverables identified in the quality assurance   surveillance plan
(i.e. completion and delivery of student evaluations)


3.0 BPA Contract Annual Review
Although there will be no option periods included in each BPA, there will be an annual review of each BPA by the BPA Contracting Officer.  The
purpose of the review is to determine whether the BPA still represents the best value (considering price, special qualifications, market
conditions, etc.).

4.0  Annual BPA Assessment (Potential for Open Competition and Additional Courses)
The BPA will be reviewed annually to determine whether it would be appropriate to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the purpose of adding
additional BPA holders.  If it is in the best interest of the Government, the BPA administrative contracting officer  may conduct a competition
to add additional BPA holders.

The Government reserves the right to add additional training courses within the general subject matter (computer courses) and will do so by
execution of a modification to the BPA.

5. 0 Post Award Evaluation of Contractor Performance
A successful BPA Contractor will have their performance evaluated throughout the life of the BPA.  The evaluation(s) may be used to determine
suitability for future Federal contracts.


This BPA is subject to a performance evaluation.  Following the end of each annual period and BPA completion, a completed Government evaluation
shall be forwarded to the Contractor.  The Contractor may submit written comments, if any, within the time period specified in the evaluation
transmittal.  The Contractor’s comments shall be considered in the issuance of the final evaluation document.  Any disagreement between the
parties regarding the evaluation shall be forwarded to the Bureau Chief Procurement Officer (BCPO).  The final evaluation of the Contractor’s
performance is the decision of the BCPO.  A copy of the final performance evaluation report will be sent to the Contractor and to the
Government’s past performance database at www.ppirs.gov.

will be responsible for administering the BPA and any resulting BPA calls.

2.0  Invoices and Payments
Invoices shall be submitted electronically through the Internet Payment Platform (IPP).  The IPP is a comprehensive payment information service
provided at no charge by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Management Service (FMS).  The IPP provides a centralized location to
view all transactions in the order-to-pay process, transforming paper-based processes into an electronic process for both the agency and
supplier.  IPP is the BEP’s preferred method of submitting invoices for payment. For contractors who require more information on the IPP
program, including enrollment, please contact the support activity using the information below:

            Internet Payment Platform (IPP) Support
            (617) 973-3069
            IPPgroup@bos.frb.org

Invoices shall be submitted upon completion of each course, or if multiple courses occur within a month, at the end of the month.

VI.  SPECIAL BPA REQUIREMENTS

1.0  Rights/Guarantees

in the event the Contractor is solicited and/or awarded a BPA call.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of BPA calls or
actual amount of work to be ordered and a BPA does not obligate money and shall not be construed as a guarantee on behalf of the Government to
solicit or issue a BPA call.  The Government reserves the right to issue no BPA Call Request for Proposals and no BPA calls under a BPA.  There
is no minimum guarantee of work ordered against any awarded BPA.

2. 0 Travel
a. Travel may be required during the performance of a BPA call and will be specified, if  required, during BPA call issuance.  Travel shall be

Worth, TX.  Only travel costs outside the 50-mile radius of the training site location will     be reimbursed.  This is the case regardless of
location of the home or branch office of the BPA contract holder.


      c. The Contractor shall not be reimbursed as a direct charge under this BPA for any costs of transportation      associated with Contractor
personnel travel to and from their place of residence to their primary place of      employment.

    (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.
    (iii) Final decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if—

        (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see 32.607-2).
    (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the

of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor
can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination.  The
Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.  This paragraph does

amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided

contracts funded under that Act; 49 U.S.C. 40118, Fly American; and 41 U.S.C. 423 relating to procurement integrity.
        (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following
order:
      (1) The schedule of supplies/services.
      (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, and Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts paragraphs of
      this clause.
      (3) The clause at 52.212-5.

      (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
      (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
      (7) The Standard Form 1449.
      (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
      (9) The specification.
        (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
      (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance
on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review
and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is
current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute
for a properly executed contractual document.
      (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and
(C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the
notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
          (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement
at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information
that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the
meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
      (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect
an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the
CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.
            (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate
offers:

      Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  As offerors' rating for non-price factors approach
equivalency, price becomes more important in the award decision.  As pricing approaches equivalency, the non-price factors becomes more
important in the award decision.

      (b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the
basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of
options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
      (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for
acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified
expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a
written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2, EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

Evaluation of Proposals
Proposals received in response to the solicitation will be evaluated based on best value to Government.  Specifically, the best value approach
permits the Government to select the most advantageous offer based on price factors and non-price factors.

The proposals will be evaluated on the following factors:

Technical
      Course Material  - The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the requirement and overall scope of work required, and the
      Offeror's technical capability.  Course materials will be evaluated to determine if they meet the stated requirements in accordance with
      the PWS.


      Instructor Qualifications and Experience - The Government will evaluate the relevancy of the work experience of the instructor(s) to the
      scope of work to be performed as outlined in the PWS in section 3.0 and the environment in which instruction has been provided (i.e Federal
      and/or manufacturing).  The Government will evaluate the instructor's experience in providing same or similar computer training as defined
      in the PWS to a diverse workforce to include a mix of professional, administrative, technical, clerical and blue collar workers.


Past Performance
      Relevancy:
      Past performance will be evaluated for its relevance to the requirements of this PWS.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's
      experience in the development and delivery of same or similar services (i.e Microsoft and Keyboarding courses) to a diverse workforce to
      include a mix of: professional, administrative, technical, clerical and blue collar workers and the relevancy to the requirements in the
      PWS.  The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past instructional experience in a Federal and/or manufacturing agency.




      Past Performance References:
      The Government will evaluate the responses received from the references and/or other sources to evaluate the types of trainings provided
      and the Offeror's performance in the delivery of same or similar training topics.


Price
      The Government will use price analysis techniques to evaluate price to determine that prices are fair and reasonable.  For purposes of
      evaluation only, price proposals will be evaluated based on the price for the maximum number of students and based on each course offering
      being offered one time each year.

      (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
-
         (1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;
         (2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
         (3) * Are, * are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any
of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
         (4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
           (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
           (ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a
proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the
Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax
liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax
liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial
appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

      (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in

      [  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in
the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or
indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those
efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
      (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to
this solicitation is predominantly—
         (1) ο In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States

that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
           [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that—

subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly
average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract
period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
(     iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used

   (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror’s relationship with the
