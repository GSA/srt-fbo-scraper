                                                       Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

1.  Objective.  This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) serves as the principal basis for assessing overall performance quality
associated with the United States Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) support services contract.  This document will be used by the
Government to assess the effectiveness of the Contractor’s management and technical services consistent with their proposed quality standards.
This QASP provides the methodology by which the Contractor's performance will be monitored to determine compliance with established performance
objectives and to establish performance benchmarks that ensure a quantifiable basis for measuring effectiveness.  The plan is designed so that
surveillance is limited to that which is necessary to verify the Contractor is performing management and technical services satisfactorily and
relates directly to performance objectives of the performance objectives delineated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).

2.  Government Surveillance.  The MCWL will identify an individual to function as the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) for this task,
and her/his authority will be limited to administering specific technical aspects of the contract and task orders as set forth in Section E,
Inspection and Acceptance.  The COR will not provide direction that is outside the scope of responsibilities delineated under this contract and
task orders and will defer any conditional interpretations of performance expectations to the Contracting Officer.  The COR will perform the
following:

    • Maintain a detailed knowledge of the technical requirements of the contract;
    • Document Contractor performance in accordance with the QASP and the approved Contractor Quality Plan (QP);
    • Identify and immediately forward notifications of deficient, or non-compliant performance to the Contracting Officer; and
    • Approve priorities of support, resources, and associated schedules.

3.  Surveillance Methods. Surveillance of Contractor performance is the method used by the Government to determine whether the contractor is
effectively and efficiently complying with all terms and conditions of the contract and task orders.  In addition to statistical analysis, the
functional expertise of the COR plays a critical role in adequately evaluating contractor performance.  The below listed methods of surveillance
shall be used in the administration of this QASP and the standards are delineated by Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) elements in the Performance
Requirements Survey (PRS) table:

Demonstration:  A qualification method that is carried out by operation and relies on observable functional operation.  It does not require the
use of instrumentation or special test equipment;

Analysis:  A qualification method that is carried out by examining and assessing the application of techniques in order to determine if they are
appropriate and sufficient. The quality of performance can be determined from government or contractor task-based or Management Information
System (MIS) reports, contractor ISO 9000 techniques and procedures, or from government observation of completed tasks. In some instances,
reports may be available in the form of information on a contractor's performance against contract requirements. Reports generally provide
information regarding various characteristics of tasks and can, therefore, be used to determine acceptability of a contractor's performance.


Inspections:  A qualitative inspections can be accomplished through one of the following techniques:

Random or Stratified Sampling: With random sampling, services are sampled to determine if the level of performance is acceptable.  Random
sampling works best when the number of instances of the services being performed is very large and a statistically valid sample can be obtained.
Stratified sampling focuses on selected parts of total contractor output for sampling. Computer programs may be available to assist in
establishing sampling procedures.

Periodic Inspection, Judgmental Inspection or Planned Sampling: This method, sometimes called "planned sampling,” consists of the evaluation of
tasks selected on other than a 100% or random basis.

4.  Performance Requirements. The performance requirements set forth in this section correspond to the material content cited in the PWS and the
evaluation factors.

Corresponding ratings will be generated for each of the weighted performance areas and aggregated monthly.  The COR will track performance using
a moving average and reconcile performance with the Contractor’s Program Manager and Task Leads.  This information will also be shared with the
Contracting Officer and included in CPARs reports and any past performance assistance requests:

The criteria that will be used to accomplish the evaluation ratings is derived from the RFP and from the elements of performance determined to
be most influential to performance.

Numerical values for the adjectival ratings are: >.95 – Excellent – Exceeds standard compliance; .85 - .94 – standard compliance – Acceptable;
and <.85 – unacceptable.

USMC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION (March 2008)
 To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, "ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF PAYMENT REQUEST (MAR 2008)", the United States Marine Corps (USMC) utilizes Wide
Area WorkFlow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to
submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents electronically.
The contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports under this contract/order, unless the provision
at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies.
The contractor shall:
 i) Ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov
ii) Register on WAWF-RA at https://wawf.eb.mil, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification.  Systematic

UPS, Transportation/Shipping Documentation, etc.) allowing confirmation of delivery by the Government.  Tracking information and packing slip or

52.203-5     COVENANT AGAINST CONTINGENT FEES (APR 1984)

(a) The Contractor warrants that no person or agency has been employed or retained to solicit or obtain this contract upon an agreement or
understanding for a contingent fee, except a bona fide employee or agency. For breach or violation of this warranty, the Government shall have
the right to annul this contract without liability or, in its discretion, to deduct from the contract price or consideration, or otherwise
recover, the full amount of the contingent fee.

(b) "Bona fide agency," as used in this clause, means an established commercial or selling agency, maintained by a contractor for the purpose of
securing business, that neither exerts nor proposes to exert improper influence to solicit or obtain Government contracts nor holds itself out
as being able to obtain any Government contract or contracts through improper influence.

"Bona fide employee," as used in this clause, means a person, employed by a contractor and subject to the contractor's supervision and control
as to time, place, and manner of performance, who neither exerts nor proposes to exert improper influence to solicit or obtain Government
contracts nor holds out as being able to obtain any Government contract or contracts through improper influence.

person or concern has in securing a Government contract.

"Improper influence," as used in this clause, means any influence that induces or tends to induce a Government employee or officer to give
consideration or to act regarding a Government contract on any basis other than the merits of the matter.

(End of clause)


52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)

(a) Definitions. As used in this provision--

“Proposal revision” is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer
as the result of negotiations.

“Time”, if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and

local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due.

(ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified
for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that
accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--

the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or

(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under
the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

(3) It is the only proposal received.

(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered
at any time it is received and may be accepted.

(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on
the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.

(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated
for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on
the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be
withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before
award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror

(5) Offerors shall submit proposals in response to this solicitation in English, unless otherwise permitted by the solicitation, and in U.S.
dollars, unless the provision at FAR 52.225-17, Evaluation of Foreign Currency Offers, is included in the solicitation.

(e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for
any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall--

(1) Mark the title page with the following legend: This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not
be duplicated, used, or disclosed--in whole or in part--for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded
to this offeror as a result of--or in connection with-- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or
disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information
contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets
[insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and

(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the
restriction on the title page of this proposal.

(f) Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s)
whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.

(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest.

(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in
FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.
The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting
Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient
competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that
will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices
offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the
proposal.

(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the
Government's best interest to do so.

(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline
items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is
significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the
Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.

(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or
schedule risk.

(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal
shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:

(i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer.

(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on
the debriefed offeror.

(iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.

(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.

(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.

(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the
solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items

The Government will select for award the proposal, conforming to the solicitation requirements, determined to provide the “best value” to the
Government and to be most advantageous to the Government considering technical, management, past performance, and price factors.  The Government
may select for award the offeror whose total evaluated price is not necessarily the lowest, but whose non-price proposals (technical capability,
performance execution and management, and past performance) are sufficiently more advantageous to the government so as to justify the payment of
additional price.  Conversely, the government may select for award the offeror whose total evaluated price is lower than one or more other
proposals when the offerors ‘ non-price proposals are not sufficiently more advantageous so as to justify the payment of additional costs.

The Government may evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the
offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer
later determines it to be necessary.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Of the following Factors, Factor 1, Technical Capability, and Factor 2, Performance Execution and Management, are equal in importance to each
other and each is significantly more important than Factor 3, Past Performance.  Factor 3 Past Performance is more important than price.  When
combined, the non-priced factors are more important than the price factor. Although price is the least important factor, it becomes increasingly
important when offerors receive similar ratings for the non-priced factors.  Prospective Offerors are forewarned that a proposal meeting
solicitation requirements with the lowest evaluated price may not be selected if award to a higher evaluated priced Offeror is determined to be
most advantageous to the Government.  The Government may select for award the offeror whose total evaluated price is lower than one or more
other proposals, when the other offerors’ non-price proposals are not sufficiently more advantageous so as to justify the payment of additional
costs.

Factor 1.  Technical Capability.  The Government will evaluate each Offeror’s technical capabilities to assess how well they may be expected to
perform the contract based on the following:  (1) The offerors demonstrated understanding of the PWS requirements; (2) The offeror’s ability  to
handle the complexities and minimize risks that are inherent in the PWS requirements; (3) The offeror’s knowledge and understanding to
effectively and efficiently manage the contract requirements;  (4) The  Program Manager’s ability to maintain visibility and control of all
levels of support; and (5) The offerors innovative approaches in providing services required by the PWS.

Factor 2.  Performance Execution and Management.  The Government will evaluate each Offeror’s performance  execution and management capabilities
to assess how well they may be expected to perform the contract based on the following criteria:  (1) The offeror’s understanding of  contract
management,  modification management, subcontractor interaction and management, Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) and OCI Mitigation
Plan; (2) The offeror’s management approach in planning, managing, and controlling the multiple tasks that may be specified by the
modifications; (3) How suitable the offeror is to efficiently  manage and provide an active, responsive staffing vacancy-filling system to
ensure adequate manning throughout the contract period (process for new personnel);  and (4) The offeror’s ability in recruiting and initially
staffing the requirements of the PWS.

Factor 3. Past Performance.  The Government will evaluate this factor on  (1) The relevant background and experience of Key Personnel, in matrix
form, that shows their related experience, expertise, qualifications, and direct correlation to the PWS requirements and, (2) the relevant
background and experience of the non-key personnel in direct support of the PWS, showing experience, expertise, qualifications, and direct
correlation to the PWS requirements.  The Offerors will be rated on relevance of corporate experience to this task and the quality of relevant
experience.  Experience relative to this task will be assessed by considering aspects such as the following: quality of products and services;
timeliness of performance; cost control, cost monitoring and reporting; business relations; overall customer satisfaction.   In addition to the
sources identified by the offeror, the Government may review Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and/or DOD Past
Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) ratings and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. The Government may
also contact previous customers, and review other relevant past performance information contained in local files and other sources, including
Federal, State, and local Government agencies, Better Business Bureaus, published media and electronic databases.

Factor 4. Price . Evaluation of the proposed prices for the support services may be compared to the Government Estimate and/or other proposed
price competition to determined price reasonableness.  The Government will evaluate the incidental services based on the firm fixed labor rates,
and the total extended dollar amount, which will serve as the not-to-exceed amount for incidental services.   The proposed incidental service
prices may be compared to the Government Estimate and/or, if available, other proposed contact prices to determine price reasonableness.

Prospective Offerors are forewarned that a proposal meeting solicitation requirements with the lowest evaluated price may not be selected if
award to a higher evaluated, higher priced Offeror is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government.  If proposed prices are
considered unreasonable, greater risk will be assessed, and the Government may infer a lack of understanding of the requirements.

Options.  The price for the base year and options years will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (July 2009).
The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.
The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not
obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

RATINGS:  Note:  The rating definitions in Table 1 will be used in evaluating Factors 1 and 2 and Table 2 and 3 will be used to evaluate Factor
3.  A proposal that receives an “Unacceptable” rating for any Factor will not be considered for award.  No further evaluation of the proposal
shall be performed.  (i.e. price proposals) and the Offeror will not be considered for award.

The combined technical/risk ratings below, includes consideration of risk in conjunction with the strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies in
determining technical ratings. Combined
technical/risk evaluations shall utilize the combined technical/risk ratings listed in Table 1, below.

*** A proposal that receives a final "Unacceptable" rating from the source selection authority for any Factor will result in the entire proposal
being determined to be "unacceptable."  The proposal will not be considered to be in the competitive range, and no discussions will be conducted
with the offeror.  No further evaluation of the proposal shall be performed and the offeror will not be considered further for award."
Past Performance Evaluation Ratings.  There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation.

The first aspect is to evaluate the offeror’s past performance to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the offeror  is  to  the
effort to be acquired. Common aspects of relevancy include similarity of service/support, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and degree  of
subcontract/teaming. Table 2 is the Past Peformance Relevancy rating.

The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts.  Table 3 is the
Performance Confidence Assessment

                                                                     Table 3





                            Attachement 2

I understand that in connection with my participation in the N00024-12-R-0002 acquisition, I may acquire or have access to information relating
to any aspect of that acquisition. I hereby agree that I will not discuss with or reveal to any representative of any governmental entity,
business organization, other entity, or any individual person (except persons specifically authorized by the Procuring Contracting Officer
(PCO)), either within or outside the U.S. Government, any aspect of the this acquisition. The term “any aspect of the this acquisition”
includes, but is not limited to, information contained (or to be contained) in any acquisition documentation created by the United States Navy
pursuant to FAR Subpart 7.1, DoD Directive 5000.1, DoD Instruction 5000.2, DoD Regulation 5000.2-R, or SECNAVINST 5000.2B, requests for
quotations/proposals, source selection information (as that term is defined in FAR § 2.101), trade secrets and other proprietary information (18
U.S.C. §§ 1832, 1905), the number and identity of Government personnel involved, and the schedule of key technical and acquisition events in the
acquisition process. Except as specifically authorized by the PCO, release of such information is not authorized. I agree that this obligation
shall continue both during the period of my current participation and thereafter.

      I recognize that a significant factor in the successful and proper completion of the this acquisition is the strict confidentiality
observed by all participants in the various evaluation, review, and discussion groups concerning all of the activities and procedures involved
in acquisition development, and that failure to comply with these requirements may compromise the award decision. I acknowledge that the
unauthorized release of acquisition information may result in the termination of my participation in this acquisition. Furthermore, I am aware
that the unauthorized release of such information may subject me to criminal and civil penalties and adverse personnel actions.

      In the event that I release any information described above or become aware that someone else has released such information, I agree to
advise the Contracting Officer. When advising the Contracting Officer, I will provide him/her with the following information: (1) the business
organization or other entity, or individual person, to whom the information in question was divulged, (2) the identity of the person that
disclosed the information, and (3) the content of the information.

      I further affirm that if I am notified of the identity of offerors, their subcontractors, joint venture partners, and team members by
whatever means, I will (1) disclose to the Contracting Officer and to HQMC Office of Counsel whether I or any member of my immediate family*
have any holdings or interest whatsoever in any offeror, their subcontractors, joint venture partners, or team members, and (2) if I or a member
of my immediate family* acquire holdings or interest in any offeror, their subcontractors, joint venture partners, or team members, notify the
Contracting Officer and will not participate in any aspect of the N00024-12-R-0002 acquisition unless authorized to do so by the Contracting
Officer and HQMC Office of Counsel. If I am an HQMC employee and have been required by the Contracting Officer to complete the OGE Form 450 or
SF 278, a copy of my most recent OGE Form 450 or SF 278 is on file or is to be submitted prior to my participation in the N00024-12-R-0002
acquisition.
