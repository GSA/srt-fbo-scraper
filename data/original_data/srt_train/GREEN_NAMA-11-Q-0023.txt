This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; fixed price quotations are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-11-Q-0023 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  Quotations furnished are not offers.  This request does not commit the government to pay any costs incurred in the preparation of the submission of this quotation or to contract for supplies or services.  Any representations and/or certifications attached to this RFQ must be completed by the vendor.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-52 effective May 31, 2011.  COMPETITION: This is an unrestricted procurement, subject to full and open competition.  EVALUATION: The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussions of this procurement. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation.  Award will be made to the offeror whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this award will be obtained through a lowest priced technically acceptable evaluation, based on the lowest life cycle price (see Part B of Enclosure 1).  NARA recognizes that the cost of printers is not simply tied to the hardware itself but also the consumables used during the life cycle of the printer.  For the price evaluation of the printers that are the subject of this RFQ, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requires Contractors to provide life cycle pricing to include the price of the printer and the toner cartridges that are to be consumed during the life cycle of the printer.  However, NARA is not obligated to award CLIN 0002, as it is an option CLIN.  Contractors must provide pricing for each CLIN.  The Government will only accept commercial-off-the-shelf items.  Contractors must submit itemized specifications—that address each enumerated requirement of Enclosure 5, Salient Characteristics—for each quoted item to facilitate a comprehensive Government evaluation.  Section 508 Evaluation Factors- Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for receipt of the contract after it has been determined that the quotation adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508.  Only quotations which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (completed Enclosure 4, Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT)) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.  CONTRACT TYPE: NARA intends to award an indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contract.  This anticipated contract shall be comprised of a CLIN that utilizes firm fixed unit prices for the purpose of effectuating orders.  The Government guarantees that it will place orders for, at the very least, the Minimum Quantity for CLIN 0001 with the successful Contractor.  The initial order will be placed immediately following award.  NARA may issue additional orders to the successful firm from the Date of Award through September 30, 2011, up to the Maximum Quantity listed.  REQUIREMENTS: F.O.B. Destination pricing is requested for CLINs 0001 and 0002; all delivery costs must be included in total firm fixed unit price.  See Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  Submit pricing in accordance with the aforementioned directions and table in Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.  See Enclosure 5, Salient Characteristics for specifications.  DELIVERY: Packaging must be in a manner that prevents damage to the equipment during shipment.  Delivery must be undertaken during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, unless mutually agreed upon by  and the Contractor.  Deliveries will be made in accordance with Enclosure 2, Delivery Schedule.  ORDERING PERIOD: Date of Award through September 30, 2011.  AFFIRMATION STATEMENTS: Contractors must include the Trade Agreement Act (TAA) Country of Production in their quotation submissions in order to assist with verification of TAA compliance.  Contractors must confirm in their quote that all products quoted meet the Energy Star® energy use requirements.  All items quoted must be IPv6 compliant.  Section 508 Program Need - Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the following program need: "HP LaserJet P2055dn or Equal."  Section 508 Deliverable Requirements - Technical standards from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those technical provisions identified as applicable in Enclosure 4, Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).  Functional performance criteria from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart C have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those functional performance criteria identified as applicable in Enclosure 4.  Information, documentation, and support requirements from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart D have been determined to apply to this acquisition.  Solicitation respondents must describe how the information, documentation, and support proposed for HP LaserJet P2055dn or Equal deliverables meet at least those information, documentation, and support requirements identified as applicable in Enclosure 4.  Section 508 Acceptance Criteria - HP LaserJet P2055dn or Equal delivered as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility.  HP LaserJet P2055dn or Equal delivered must include a completed GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of this solicitation.   Contractors must complete and return Enclosure 3, Required Quote Information.  It is the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure that  is not provided either counterfeit or grey market products.  In the event that such IT products  determined to be counterfeit or grey market,  will seek  available legal remedies including criminal prosecution.  Counterfeit information technology product means any item of information technology (IT), including hardware  software that is an unauthorized , replica, or substitute.  A grey market or gray market also known as parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer.  As a result manufacturers will not honor associated warranties and service agreements.  Unless you, the Contractor, are authorized by the manufacturer to resell the particular items you are quoting in the USA, it is in your best interest as well as the Government’s that you simply do not respond.  NARA will verify with the manufacturers immediately upon order issuance that the Contractor is an authorized reseller for this buy.  Any issues with the information provided by the manufacturer to the Government about the grey market status of the items must be addressed by the Contractor to the manufacturer.  The Government will immediately cancel any order based on a quotation of grey market items.  In an effort to further ensure NARA is receiving new, manufacturer approved Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) items and will receive the benefits of any warranties or other manufacturer guarantees, NARA requires contractors to submit with their quote proof in writing from the OEM manufacturer of their status as an authorized/certified OEM Contractor of the manufactured items.  Contractors must complete and return Enclosure 3, Required Quote Information, and Enclosure 4, Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT), in order for their quotations to be considered.  QUESTIONS: Questions regarding this RFQ must be submitted in writing to Ms. Evelyn Dean no later than 4:00 PM ET on June 17, 2011 to be considered.  Questions submitted in any other manner will not be answered.  The Government will answer questions or requests for clarification via a written RFQ amendment.  RFQ CLOSE DATE: Two copies of each quotation should be mailed to National Archives and Records Administration (), Attention: Evelyn Dean – Contractor Support, 8601 Adelphi Road, Room 3340, College Park, MD 20740-6001 or e-mailed to:  . Quotations should be received by 4:00 PM ET on June 24, 2011.  Please allow one extra business day for delivery and receipt if quotation is sent via e-mail, as the e-mail will need to pass through IT security. Telephonic responses will not be processed.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant fixed price IDIQ contract, with the exception of FAR provisions which will be removed prior to issuance of the contract:

SCHEDULE OF PRICES – PART A



Contract Line Items (CLINs) Required: For evaluation purposes, the firm-fixed price for each contract line item (CLIN) will be determined by multiplying the Unit Price by the Maximum Quantity of units, and the Total firm fixed price will be determined by totaling the firm-fixed price of each CLIN.

SCHEDULE OF PRICES – PART B

LIFE CYCLE COST WORKSHEET FOR PRINTERS

Completion and submission of this worksheet is required.  Failure to submit this worksheet with the quotation will result in rejection of the entire quotation without review.

NARA recognizes that the cost of printers is not simply tied to the hardware itself but also the consumables used during the life cycle of the printer.  For the price evaluation of the printer(s) that are the subject of this RFQ, NARA requires Contractors to provide lifecycle pricing to include the price of the printer and the toner cartridges that are to be consumed during the lifecycle of the printer(s).  NARA requires refurbished toner cartridges if available, and Contractors must clearly indicate whether or not the cartridges are new or refurbished, along with the make and model number.  Toner calculations must be based on the number of toner cartridges required to meet this lifecycle demand.  

The low price determination, therefore, will be based on the lowest lifecycle price.  All prices used for this calculation must be prices that the Contractor is willing to honor and as such the prices for the printers and toner will be the prices of the respective CLINs in Part A.

CLIN 0001 Printer---The life cycle of this printer is four years with an annual usage rate of 600,000 pages / year for a total usage of 2.4 million pages for the four-year life.

The GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation respondents as a part of their quotation/proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable Section 508 requirements. The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding to the six technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables correspond to accessibility information about information content deliverables and labor hours, respectively.

NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard. Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for this acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information. 



Please fill the information below as a part of request for accessibility information of your proposed product(s) and/ or service(s).
