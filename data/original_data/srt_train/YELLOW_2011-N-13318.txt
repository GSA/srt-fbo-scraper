Your physical exam revealed a rapid heart rate. We recommend making an appointment with your primary care physician for an electrocardiogram and treatment with medication if necessary. Your physical exam revealed a slow heart rate. We recommend making an appointment with your primary care physician for an electrocardiogram and treatment with medication if necessary. Your physical exam revealed an irregular heart rate. We recommend making an appointment with your primary care physician for an electrocardiogram and treatment with medication if necessary.







For your records, your height is _________, and weight is _________.
 

Your physical examination showed a normal Body Mass Index, indicating a normal weight. Your physical exam revealed an elevated Body Mass Index, which may indicate that you are overweight. We suggest seeing your primary medical doctor for lifestyle modification and weight loss recommendations. Your BMI is above the defined normal. On physical examination, however, you appeared to be heavily muscled rather than overweight.



 

Examination of your ears, sinuses, and nose revealed no abnormalities. Your chest and lung examination was normal. There were no other significant clinical findings on physical examination. Your physical examination was normal except for the following: EYES: We recommend scheduling an eye examination with either your primary medical doctor or eye doctor for follow up for the following findings.
 



Your physical exam revealed an abnormal eye exam. Your eye exam revealed irritation and inflammation of the whites of your eyes. This may be caused by infection, allergies, or environmental irritants.



EARS, NOSE and SINUSES:, We recommend follow up with an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for a repeat examination for any of the following findings.
     

Your physical exam revealed a perforated eardrum. Your physical exam revealed an external ear canal infection. Your physical exam revealed an internal ear infection. Your physical exam revealed fluid in your ear. This may be a sign of infection or allergies. Your nasal exam shows an abnormality in your nasal septum. Your nasal exam had some abnormal findings, which may be a result of allergens, infections, or environmental irritants. If your symptoms persist, we recommend follow up with your primary medical doctor or an ENT specialist for nasal steroids, decongestant, and/or antihistamines. Your symptoms and physical exam indicate you may have allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is an inflammation of the nasal passages and upper respiratory tract that is usually caused by exposure to allergens such as pollens and animal dander. If your symptoms persist, we recommend follow up with your primary medical doctor or an ENT specialist for nasal steroids, decongestant, and/or antihistamines. Your symptoms and physical exam indicate you may have irritant-induced nasal inflammation, also known as chronic rhinitis. We recommend follow up with an ENT specialist for further evaluation and treatment, including possible oral antibiotics, decongestants, and nasal steroids. Your sinus exam revealed inflammation and sinus congestion. This may be from allergic rhinitis, acute sinusitis, or chronic sinusitis. We recommend follow up with an ENT specialist for further evaluation, including possible oral antibiotics, decongestants, and nasal steroids.

Your history and physical exam suggest you may have sinusitis. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses and can be acute (several days) or chronic (several months). We recommend follow up with an ENT specialist for further evaluation, including possible oral antibiotics, decongestants, and nasal steroids. Your physical exam and symptoms are consistent with an upper respiratory tract infection. This is most commonly caused by viral infections and does not usually require prescription medications. If your symptoms persist, please follow up with your primary medical doctor.





THROAT


Your throat exam revealed inflammation. This may be due to allergies, infection, or irritation. If symptoms persist, please follow up with your primary medical doctor.



NECK: For the following findings, please follow up with your primary medical doctor for further evaluation and/or testing.


Your neck exam revealed enlarged lymph nodes. This may be a sign of infection, allergic reaction, or more serious underlying medical condition. You have a possible abnormality of your thyroid. Please follow-up with your primary medical doctor to check thyroid function tests. Your physical exam revealed a carotid bruit, an abnormal sound in the blood vessels in the neck. This suggests arterial disease that may put you at risk for a stroke or heart disease. Your physical exam revealed stridor on forced inspiration. Your physical exam revealed stridor on forced expiration.





 



CHEST


You had an abnormal lung exam. Please make an appointment to discuss these results with your primary medical doctor as soon as possible. You have reported symptoms of coughing/and wheezing/and chest tightness/and shortness of breath when you are exposed to irritating materials in the air or to cold air, this may be an indication that your airways are abnormally irritable. This should be investigated further with testing (such as a special test called the methacholine challenge test). You have reported shortness of breath on exertion. This may be a manifestation of variety of underlying conditions, including heart or lung disease. We recommend further evaluation, including an electrocardiogram by your primary medical doctor.







HEART: For the following findings, we recommend further evaluation in the near future by your primary medical doctor, including an electrocardiogram and/or other tests of heart function.


Your physical exam revealed an abnormal heart sound. This may be a sign of a variety of underlying conditions, including heart or lung disease. Your physical exam revealed an irregular heart rhythm.

MUSCULOSKELETAL: We recommend further evaluation by your primary medical doctor for the following findings:


Your physical exam revealed an abnormality in the following area(s): __________________________________________________________________________________________

PRELIMINARY SPIROMETRY TEST RESULTS:

   

Your pulmonary function test results were normal. Your pulmonary function test results were suggestive of a restrictive pattern. A restrictive pattern indicates that the amount of air you took into your lungs is less than normal. This may be due to conditions of the lung tissue itself or the chest wall. You should follow up with your primary care doctor for further evaluation. Your pulmonary function test results were suggestive of obstructive lung disease Obstructive lung disease indicates a narrowing of your airways and a decreased ability to exhale forcibly. We recommend that you follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and a complete set of pulmonary function tests. Your pulmonary function test results were suggestive of a combined obstructive and restrictive pattern of abnormality A restrictive pattern indicates that the amount of air you took into your lungs is less than normal. This may be due to conditions of the lung tissue itself or the chest wall. Obstructive lung disease indicates a narrowing of your airways and a decreased ability to exhale forcibly. We recommend that you follow up with your doctor for further evaluation and a complete set of pulmonary function tests. Your pulmonary function tests results were normal. However, your symptoms of dry cough/and/shortness of breath/and/chest tightness/and/wheezing are of concern, since they may indicate you have underlying lung problems. We recommend follow up with your primary medical doctor for further testing. Although your baseline pulmonary function tests were normal you indicated in your medical history that you experience coughing/and/wheezing/and/chest tightness/and/shortness of breath when you are exposed to irritating materials in the air or to cold air. This may be an indication that your airways are abnormally irritable, and this should be investigated with further testing (such as a special test, the methacholine challenge test). Your pulmonary function test results were suggestive of upper airway obstruction during inspiration (taking a breath in). This may occur with irritation of the vocal cords or windpipe and can decrease your ability to inhale forcefully. We recommend that you follow up with your physician for further evaluation and possible referral to an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist.

COMPARISON TO YOUR Last Visit SPIROMETRY RESULTS

   

Your lung function has improved since your Last WTC exam. Your lung function has worsened since your Last WTC exam. We recommend that you take these two breathing test reports to your doctor to confirm this change and discuss the possible need for further evaluation and treatment. There has been no significant change in your lung function since your Last WTC exam. We will repeat the breathing test again during your next exam. It is unclear whether or not your lung function has changed significantly since your Last WTC exam. The quality of the tests was not optimal. If you feel that your respiratory symptoms have worsened, consider asking your doctor to repeat the breathing test or to perform other evaluations.

CLINICAL GUIDELINES FOR ADULTS EXPOSED TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER DISASTER
ˇ Seven years after the World Trade Center (WTC) attack, many New Yorkers continue to suffer
disaster-associated physical and mental health conditions. ˇ Primary care providers should ask patients about WTC exposures, especially patients with respiratory symptoms, rhinosinusitis, reflux disease, mental health problems, and substance use disorders. ˇ Providers should know how to identify, evaluate, treat, and refer patients with conditions that could be associated with exposure to the disaster, and be alert to other WTC-associated illnesses that may be identified in the future. ˇ Because physical and mental health conditions are often intertwined, a coordinated approach to care usually works best and referral may be necessary.

T

he World Trade Center (WTC) terrorist attack and its aftermath exposed hundreds of thousands of people to debris, dust, smoke, and fumes. Studies conducted after September 11, 2001, among rescue and cleanup workers,1-6 office workers,7 building evacuees,8 and residents of lower Manhattan9-11 showed an increase in respiratory and other physical and mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Many New Yorkers have health problems that could be associated with--or made worse by--exposure to the WTC CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE

attack and its aftermath. Primary care physicians need to know how to identify, evaluate, treat, and, if necessary, refer these individuals to expert care. The recommendations in this publication are targeted to adults, including young adults who were exposed as children. Although some principles and diagnostic methods may be applicable to children and adolescents today, please consult appropriate resources such as the American Academy of Pediatrics for general (non-WTCspecific) pediatric guidelines (Resources). Clinical guidelines for children and adolescents exposed to the WTC disaster are currently being developed. Providers should monitor the literature as more information about WTC-related diseases becomes available.

EXPOSURES AND POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS Physical Exposures
The burning and collapse of the WTC and neighboring buildings released a complex mixture of irritant dust, smoke, and gaseous materials. Pulverized concrete, glass, plastic, paper, and wood produced alkaline dust.12 The dust cloud also contained heavy metals, asbestos, and other carcinogenic substances. In addition, smoke released from the persistent fires in the following months contained hazardous and carcinogenic substances. Environmental test results showed that the composition of dust and smoke released into the air and deposited on indoor and outdoor surfaces varied by date and location.13-15 Chemical tests suggest that dust protected from moisture in indoor environments retained its alkalinity more than outdoor dust that was exposed to rain.15 Individual exposure to contaminants was determined by duration and intensity of exposure, including location, activities, cleanup methods, and use of appropriate personal protective equipment. Health effects related to a particular exposure may also vary, depending on underlying medical conditions and individual susceptibility. Although heavy metals were detected in the air and dust, clinical tests performed on specimens from more than 10,000 firefighters showed no clinically significant concentrations of mercury or lead. Urine beryllium concentrations were also low in the firefighters, but the risk for beryllium sensitization is undetermined. There is no current need to perform blood or urine testing for heavy metals because heavy metals are usually cleared from the blood and urine within months of exposure.16,17

IDENTIFYING WTC-RELATED CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS
When assessing for WTC-related illnesses, clinicians should consider: ˇ Level of exposure to the immediate cloud of debris and dust released by the collapse of the WTC towers.2,8,27 ˇ Duration, type, and intensity of exposure to dust, smoke, and fumes after the disaster.2-5,8 ˇ Degree of occupational or residential exposure, such as work at the WTC site, Staten Island landfill, barge transfer operations, or morgues2-5,27,28 -- or exposure to a contaminated home, workplace, or school.13,14 While the dust, smoke, and fumes extended beyond lower Manhattan, the highest exposures occurred in the vicinity of the collapsed towers. Most individuals who developed respiratory or mental illnesses did so soon after exposure to the disaster. A slower onset or recognition of symptoms is possible, and individuals continue to present to medical monitoring and treatment programs for initial evaluation. Because individuals have different levels of tolerance, the intensity of symptoms may not be proportional to exposure.28 To date, few studies have been published on the health effects of indoor exposure on residents, office employees, students, or people who cleaned affected buildings. One study of residents found that longer duration of dust or odors in the home was associated with increased risk of respiratory symptoms.14 Other studies are currently ongoing. Regarding smoking, one study suggests that exposed individuals with a current or previous history of cigarette smoking may be more likely to develop lower respiratory disease,28 but other studies have not found an association between tobacco use and WTC-related symptoms.5,29 However, smoking is known to cause chronic respiratory disease and cancer,30 and experts agree that tobacco cessation and avoidance of secondhand smoke are important for the prevention and treatment of many diseases, including WTC-related respiratory diseases.

Mental Health Exposures
Many of those in lower Manhattan on September 11 witnessed horrific events such as the deaths of friends and co-workers and other traumatic experiences, or they were exposed to the dust cloud. Thousands of New York-area residents lost family members in the attacks. In the wake of the disaster, residents, office workers, and students in downtown Manhattan, as well as rescue and recovery workers and volunteers, were subjected to daily stress for months.18-20 For many New Yorkers, the trauma of September 11 triggered or exacerbated depression, PTSD, anxiety, or substance use disorders.8,21-26

PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS
Many of the physical health problems that are commonly seen in WTC-exposed individuals also affect individuals without WTC exposures and may not be WTC-related. The algorithm (Figure 1, foldout) and treatment options are applicable regardless of the cause of illness.

Table 1. Key WTC Occupational and Residential Exposure History Questions
Ask: "Were you exposed to the World Trade Center disaster?" If patient answers yes, ask further questions regarding the nature and duration of exposure, such as: 1) Were you in Manhattan near the World Trade Center when the planes hit the towers? Were you showered by the cloud of debris and dust when the towers collapsed? 2) Did you work or volunteer at the World Trade Center site providing rescue and recovery, cleanup, construction, or support services, or at the World Trade Center Recovery Operation on Staten Island, the WTC morgues, or on a barge? What tasks did you perform and for how long? Did you consistently use a respirator? If so, describe what kind and whether it was fit-tested. 3) Did you live, work, or attend school in lower Manhattan in the months after September 11? 4) Did you clean or restore services to homes, schools, or office buildings that were affected by the disaster? 5) Are there other WTC-related exposures that concern you? If the patient answers yes to any of the above questions, consider the possibility of WTC-associated conditions.

Irritant-Induced Asthma/Reactive Airways Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS) A number of studies have reported elevations of bronchial hyperreactivity or asthma among workers that increased with amount of exposure. One study conducted 6 months after 9/11 found that bronchial hyperreactivity was reported in 20% of firefighters present at the World Trade Center on the morning of the attack, and in 8% of those who reported to the site within 48 hours of the attack.3 In the first year post-9/11, 37% of patients evaluated at one major WTC treatment center were found to have irritantinduced asthma. A subset of people exposed to WTC contaminants have developed reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), which refers to asthma of very rapid onset (usually within 24-72 hours postexposure). Some people with previously mild or asymptomatic asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have experienced exacerbations of their symptoms.28 Symptoms: shortness of breath; chest tightness; wheezing; cough; sputum production; possible triggering of symptoms by upper respiratory infections, seasonal allergies, exercise, irritants (fragrances, detergents, secondhand smoke, particulates), or extremes of temperature or humidity; and recurrent episodes of respiratory infections requiring antibiotic treatment. Signs: pulmonary examination may be normal or may show tachypnea, wheezing, prolonged expiratory phase of respiration, hyperresonance to chest percussion, use of accessory muscles. Diagnostic Evaluation: history, physical examination, chest X-ray, and spirometry. In airways obstruction, pulmonary function tests typically show reduced forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) along with reduced FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) and positive bronchodilator response. However, the most common spirometric abnormality related to WTC exposure is decreased FVC with normal FEV1/FVC Table 2. Potentially WTC-Associated Conditions
Clinicians familiar with WTC-associated conditions have described a triad consisting of:
ˇ Chronic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis ˇ Asthma/reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) ˇ Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)/laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD)

Evaluate the patient for WTC exposure (Table 1). Inhalation and ingestion of WTC dust and fumes may have caused new illness or exacerbated preexisting conditions (Table 2). Respiratory symptoms may be due to multiple causes, and combination treatment may be useful. For respiratory illnesses, the mechanism may be an irritant-induced process in which symptoms persist due to subsequent chronic inflammation.28,31 A brief review of the diagnosis and treatment of the most commonly associated conditions follows. Develop a diagnosis and treatment plan that covers upper airway, lower airway, and reflux diseases.32 Continue treatments even if only partially effective. Always evaluate the patient's adherence to the treatment regimen before altering it. Assess the patient's ongoing environmental and occupational exposures; ask whether the patient is exposed to fumes, gases, or dusts on an ongoing basis; these exposures can exacerbate WTC-associated conditions. If the answer is yes, discuss ways to limit future exposures.33

ˇ For mild persistent asthma, use a combination of a daily inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., budesonide) and a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) as needed for the relief of symptoms. o It is usually necessary to monitor treatment closely for at least the first 3 months to show clinical improvement, particularly with comorbid rhinosinusitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). ˇ For patients with more frequent symptoms, continue inhaled corticosteroids and consider adding long-acting inhaled beta agonists (e.g., salmeterol) or leukotriene modifiers (e.g., montelukast sodium) under careful monitoring. o If spirometry is normal, consider methacholine challenge test or referral for evaluation of distal airway function. ˇ For patients with refractory symptoms even after adherence to therapy, referral to a pulmonologist is recommended. With all patients: ˇ Instruct them to avoid potentially irritating environmental or occupational triggers. ˇ For assistance with treatment management, follow the stepwise treatment guidelines based on symptom severity developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/asthsumm.pdf).36

ratio.27,34 Although this spirometry is not typical of asthma, the most common clinical presentation is consistent with asthma. Because asthma is a reversible airways disease, diagnostic evaluation, including objective tests of lung function, may be normal when the patient is not having symptoms, or because spirometry has a low sensitivity for detecting dysfunction in the distal airways.35 Therefore, response to empiric treatment may be used as a diagnostic aid, or experts can provide additional testing such as challenge testing (usually with methacholine) to detect bronchial hyperreactivity or other tests to detect increased airways resistance or small airways dysfunction. Treatment: See Table 3. Chronic Rhinitis and Rhinosinusitis Rhinitis can be allergic, nonallergic (e.g., irritantinduced), or mixed. It is often associated with sinusitis, as well as with pharyngitis and laryngitis. Chronic rhinitis has been reported in a triad with lower airway disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease as a common presentation.28 Postnasal discharge, a common symptom of rhinosinusitis, is the leading cause of protracted, chronic dry cough in patients with normal chest radiographs, and symptomatic improvement or resolution in response to treatment lends support to the diagnosis. Symptoms: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and postnasal drip, cough, facial pressure/pain, epistaxis, reduced or altered sense of smell, maxillary dental pain, lacrimation, pruritus of the eyes, nose, and/or throat, ear pressure, and fatigue.

Signs: inflammation of the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosae for more than 3 months. Treatment: See Table 4.37-39

Table 4. Treatment of Chronic Rhinitis and Rhinosinusitis*
ˇ Initially, prescribe daily nasal saline spray or irrigation/ lavage with or without both oral antihistamines (e.g., loratadine) and oral decongestants (e.g., phenylephrine) for 5-7 days. ˇ If severe mucosal swelling is noted, prescribe topical decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline) for a maximum of 3 days. ˇ If nasal and throat symptoms persist or increase after therapy with lavage and decongestants alone, prescribe nasal steroids (e.g., budesonide). The effects of nasal steroid therapy may not be seen for 2 weeks. If symptoms improve, therapy should be continued for 2-3 months. ˇ If the patient experiences fever and/or chills, persistent purulent nasal discharge with maxillary, tooth, or unilateral facial pain, sinus tenderness, or progressively worsening symptoms, be alert to bacterial superinfection of the sinuses. Sinus infections should be treated with antibiotics, and may require oral steroids. ˇ If symptoms are severe and persist after 3 months of treatment, sinus CT scan and referral for ENT consultation are recommended.
* Clinical practice guidelines have been published recently for chronic rhinosinusitis.37,38  A meta-analysis indicates that an antihistamine-decongestant combination is superior to antihistamine alone to reduce symptoms.39

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Disease (LPRD) Reflux diseases such as GERD and LPRD should be treated aggressively to improve quality of life and because of their association with gastrointestinal disease (dysphagia, peptic stricture, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma) and with respiratory disease (laryngitis, sinusitis, asthma, and chronic cough). A study of firefighters found that 87% of those with WTC-related cough had GERD.3 GERD and LPRD are closely related disorders. GERD results from the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. LPRD results from the reflux of gastric contents into the larynx/pharynx (with associated, and often unrecognized, inflammatory changes), sinuses, or lower airway. GERD Symptoms: substernal/epigastric burning, acid regurgitation, dyspepsia, cough made worse with meals or at night. LPRD Symptoms: hoarseness or other vocal changes, sore throat, cough, sensation of having a lump in the throat. GERD Signs: may be absent if mild form of disease, may note erythema/esophagitis on endoscopy if symptoms are

severe or persistent among these patients. A negative endoscopy does not mean that the patient does not have a problem. LPRD Signs: may be absent on regular physical exam, may note erythema/edema of larynx on laryngoscopy. Diagnostic Evaluation: history, physical examination, and response to empiric treatment. Endoscopy is recommended if there is no response to therapy, there is recurrence after 2-3 months, or if symptoms suggest complicated or atypical disease.32 Treatment: See Table 5.32,40-42

Evaluation of Chronic Cough
In WTC-exposed individuals, chronic cough is frequently due to some combination of the 3 syndromes described above28,43 even when there are no clear symptoms suggestive of asthma, chronic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, or GERD/LPRD.43 Such patients frequently still respond to empiric treatment. However, lack of typical symptoms and/or lack of response to therapy should prompt consideration of other causes.

Table 5. Treatment of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Disease (LPRD)*
ˇ If the patient's history is typical for uncomplicated GERD/LPRD, an initial trial of empiric therapy is appropriate. Empiric therapy includes both lifestyle modifications (e.g., dietary changes, weight loss, and smoking cessation) and acid suppression therapy. ˇ Try lifestyle modifications first; if the condition does not improve: o Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), e.g., omeprazole, provide symptomatic relief and healing of esophagitis in the highest percentage of patients. Treatment consists of a PPI for 4-8 weeks, followed by on-demand or maintenance PPI. In some cases with partial response or acid breakthrough, BID doses may be necessary with the second dose given before the evening meal.40 OR: o Histamine-2 receptor antagonists (e.g., ranitidine) may also be used. They are an effective treatment in many patients with less severe GERD/LPRD or as an adjunct with difficult to control GERD, particularly when taken at times known to trigger GERD symptoms (e.g., before exercise or a heavy meal, before bedtime). In most cases, response to PPI is superior to response to histamine-2 receptor antagonist treatment. ˇ Prokinetic agents (e.g., metoclopramide) may be used to augment treatment.41 ˇ If empiric therapy is unsuccessful after 2 to 3 months or symptoms suggest complicated or atypical disease, referral to a gastroenterologist is recommended.
*A clinical practice guideline for evaluation and treatment of chronic cough due to GERD42 and updated clinical guidelines for the treatment of GERD have recently been published.32

CITY HEALTH INFORMATION

Evaluation of a WTC-exposed individual with chronic cough is addressed in Figure 1 (foldout). Take a careful history. Before proceeding through the algorithm, do all of the following, if applicable: initiate smoking cessation, discontinue ACE inhibitor, and instruct the patient to avoid potentially irritating environmental or occupational triggers. Perform a targeted physical examination. Next, determine whether the individual's symptoms and exam suggest a specific diagnosis (i.e., chronic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, asthma, or GERD--all discussed above). If symptoms/ signs are consistent with any of these conditions or their combination,28 attempt empiric treatment for the suspected underlying disorder. When symptoms/signs are consistent with asthma/RADS, or cough alone is present, pursue a full workup beginning with a chest X-ray. Evaluate and treat abnormalities identified on the X-ray before continuing with the algorithm. Order spirometry if the chest X-ray is normal (or findings are determined to be unrelated to current symptoms). Initiate empiric treatment of asthma/ RADS for individuals with obstructive pattern and/or bronchodilator response on spirometry, or in those patients with normal spirometry who provide a history of asthmatic symptoms during irritant or other environmental provocations. For the latter, a specialist might consider a methacholine challenge test. If the spirometry is abnormal, a complete pulmonary function test is usually necessary to characterize the abnormality. Patients may require further workup, including, but not limited to, high-resolution chest CT scans (inspiratory and expiratory views)44 and full pulmonary function testing to characterize their impairment. Refer to a pulmonologist as needed. Management should focus on diagnosing and treating the specific etiology of the cough, but symptomatic treatment (i.e., cough suppression) may also be helpful provided that a full evaluation takes place.

Other Pulmonary Diseases
For some individuals, inflammatory airway reactions to WTC dust exposure may have reactivated or aggravated preexisting obstructive lung disease. Among New York City (NYC) firefighters and emergency (EMS) workers exposed to WTC rescue work, a higher-than-expected incidence of sarcoid-like granulomatous lung disease was reported in the first 5 years post-WTC.6 Sarcoidosis is often asymptomatic and found through chest X-rays (bilateral hilar and mediastinal adenopathy); thus, some cases diagnosed after 9/11 may have resulted from increased screening. The clinical presentation of the FDNY cases was unusual, in that all had intrathoracic adenopathy, 65% had signs and symptoms consistent with new-onset asthma, and 23% had additional disease outside the chest.6 Only 3 of the 26 patients had total lung capacity or diffusion capacity below 80% of predicted. There have been rare case reports of other lung diseases such as eosinophilic pneumonia,45 bronchiolitis obliterans,28,34,44 interstitial fibrosis with predominant peribronchiolar changes,28 and granulomatous pneumonitis.46 Compared to asthma, pulmonary function testing in interstitial lung disease shows reduced lung volumes rather than air-trapping or hyperinflation and reduced rather than normal diffusion capacity.47 Chest X-rays can be helpful, but a high-resolution chest CT scan without contrast may be either diagnostic or allow for targeted surgical sampling of the pathologically affected tissue. Treatment requires systemic high-dose anti-inflammatory regimens and therefore should only be instituted after the diagnosis is confirmed. When pulmonary fibrosis is extensive, lung transplantation may be the only option.47 Referral to a WTC treatment program or a pulmonologist is recommended for all patients with suspected interstitial lung disease.

Workers' Compensation
To file a claim now or in the future, workers and volunteers must submit a WTC-12 registration form. Registering will preserve their right to file for 9/11-related compensation in the future even if they are not sick now. Some uniformed City employees are not eligible for Workers' Compensation, but are eligible for other programs (Resources).

Other Medical Conditions
Patients may also present with other conditions that may or may not be linked to WTC exposure. Cancers generally have a long latency period. Substances released by the collapse of the towers included carcinogenic substances, and studies are currently underway to detect whether rates of any cancers, including both hematologic malignancies (which have shorter latency periods) and solid tumors, are elevated. Another condition being investigated is

Vol. 27 No. 6

47

myositis. Findings have not yet linked these cases to WTC exposure, but patients with illnesses possibly related to WTC exposure may benefit from free evaluation and treatment from specialists at one of the Centers of Excellence medical monitoring and treatment programs (see page 1). These programs offer updated information about conditions under investigation; they do not provide general primary care services and therefore complement rather than supplant the role of the primary care physician.

ˇ Assess for symptoms of PTSD (Table 7), depression (Table 8, Table 9), GAD (Table 10), and substance use disorders (Table 11). ˇ Educate patients about normal stress reactions. ˇ Diagnose/manage these conditions consistent with treatment guidelines and refer patients when appropriate.52 Physicians should probe for psychiatric symptoms because some patients may be reluctant to discuss their symptoms. Primary care providers can either make a diagnosis based on their assessment and treat accordingly, or refer patients to a mental health professional. Patients with multiple mental health conditions are more difficult to diagnose and treat, and should be referred to a mental health professional.

Disease Reporting
Accurate, timely, and complete reporting is essential to monitoring and understanding the extent of WTC-related disease. Under New York State Public Health Law, physicians, health care facilities, and clinical laboratories are legally mandated to report: ˇ Any cancer that is diagnosed or treated; please contact the New York State Cancer Registry (Resources). ˇ Clinical evidence of occupational lung disease within 10 days of diagnosis; please contact the New York State Occupational Lung Disease Registry (Resources). The New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) also maintains a registry of deaths among rescue and recovery workers (Resources).

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
PTSD may develop in individuals exposed to traumatic events involving the threat of serious injury or death to self or others, and when the individual's response involves intense fear, helplessness, or horror. PTSD is characterized by all of the following symptoms that arise immediately or after a lag time, and cause significant distress or impaired functioning for more than a month.55,56 ˇ Re-experiencing the traumatic event, such as experiencing distressing memories, nightmares, or flashbacks; and ˇ Avoiding reminders of the event, such as thoughts, feelings, conversations; activities, places, or people; inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma; feeling emotionally detached or numb; and ˇ Chronically increased arousal symptoms such as insomnia, irritability, poor concentration, hypervigilance, or an exaggerated startle reaction. Recognizing PTSD and Differential Diagnosis Diagnosing PTSD (Table 7) can be difficult because many patients may also suffer from other psychiatric disorders, such as MDD or another anxiety disorder, and may also initially report somatic complaints.56,57 These disorders and their physical manifestations increase functional impairment and may also increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.56-59 In addition, many patients are reluctant to disclose traumatic experiences unless a professional inquires about them.57

MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS
People who were injured in the collapse of buildings, who witnessed the injury or death of others during the attack, who fled the collapse of the towers, or who were involved in rescue and recovery efforts experienced considerable psychological stress and direct trauma. Trauma may also have resulted from the loss of a loved one or from constant exposure to graphic media coverage of the attacks. WTCrelated physical illness or economic hardship may also have caused psychological stress. For most individuals, acute stress symptoms abated quickly. However, some individuals developed disorders such as PTSD, depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), or a substance use disorder.19,48-50 Primary care providers can serve an important role in the identification, evaluation, treatment, and referral of these mental health disorders.19,51 ˇ Be alert to risk factors and signs that may indicate one of these disorders. ˇ Establish a trauma history and screen for mental health disorder risk factors (Table 6).

Major Depressive Disorder
Major depressive disorder is a disabling condition that affects many aspects of a person's life and overall functioning. People who directly witnessed the WTC attacks and those who participated in the rescue and recovery efforts

may be at increased risk for developing depression, with or without PTSD.59 Depression is typically characterized by many or all of the following: feelings of extreme sadness, anhedonia, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, insomnia, inability to concentrate, loss of appetite, and thoughts of suicide and/or death. Depression may occur only once, but is more commonly a recurring condition.60,61 A physician can simply and quickly screen for depression by using a 2-question tool, the Patient Health Questionnaire2 (PHQ-2) (Table 8).62 If the patient responds "yes" to either question, consider using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (Table 8). This 9-item questionnaire can reliably detect and quantify the severity of depression, and can be used to help monitor response to treatment.63 If the response to question 9 on the PHQ-9 is positive, evaluate the patient's suicide risk (Table 9). The comprehensive management of depression includes pharmacological treatment and nonpharmacological approaches such as psychotherapy, patient education, increased physical activity,64 and other self-management techniques, referral if required, and ongoing monitoring. Factors affecting choice of treatment include severity of symptoms, psychosocial stressors, comorbid conditions, patient preference, and availability of resources. Patients should be monitored frequently for treatment effectiveness, suicidality, and adverse effects common with

ˇ Exposure therapy helps to reduce the arousal and distress associated with memories of trauma and has proven efficacy in treating PTSD. Exposure therapy is often combined with relaxation and breathing techniques that help patients manage anxiety and cope with stress.71 ˇ Other psychotherapy interventions, including cognitive and behavioral therapies, may be effective, but further research is needed to determine efficacy.71

ˇ First-line treatment: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)--sertraline (ZoloftŽ) and paroxetine (PaxilŽ)--are FDAapproved for treatment of PTSD. If there is no response to an SSRI, venlafaxine (EffexorŽ) or other antidepressants such as mirtazepine (RemeronŽ), duloxetine (CymbaltaŽ), and bupropion (WellbutrinŽ) can be tried. ˇ For treatment-resistant PTSD: tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may be considered. Due to their side effects, these antidepressants should not be considered as a first line of treatment. ˇ For partial response: combining antidepressants with other psychotropic medications (mood stabilizers, antiadrenergic medications, antianxiety agents, and atypical antipsychotics) may be helpful. ˇ A combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy may be indicated for some patients. Treatment selection should always account for other co-occurring psychiatric comorbidities. ˇ For patients with complex psychopharmacological needs, consulting a psychiatrist is recommended.

Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy can be used either alone or in combination for patients presenting with mild episodes of major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients with moderate to severe MDD should generally be prescribed antidepressant medications, and may also benefit from psychotherapy.60

Exercise64
Aerobic exercise is an effective treatment for mild to moderate depression and is also effective as an adjunct to the treatment modalities for moderate to severe depression.64 Exercise also has many other health benefits.60

Pharmacotherapy60
SSRIs or other new agents are generally preferable to tricyclic antidepressants. It is easier to titrate the dose of the newer antidepressant medications (SSRIs, bupropion, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine) and they have less severe side effects, allowing for a quicker response, better adherence, fewer office visits, and lower cost. During treatment with an SSRI, patients may complain of feeling jittery, an increase in anxiety, nausea or gastrointestinal upset, or sexual problems such as delayed ejaculation in men and anorgasmia in women. Other adverse effects seen with many of the antidepressants include insomnia or sedation, headaches, or weight changes. Patients should be advised that while benefits may be delayed or appear slowly, adverse effects can occur immediately. However, adverse effects are usually mild and improve with time or can be managed by adjusting or changing medications. SSRIs: citalopram (CelexaŽ); escitalopram (LexaproŽ); fluoxetine (ProzacŽ, ProzacŽ WeeklyTM); paroxetine (PaxilŽ, Paxil CRŽ); sertraline (ZoloftŽ) Other New Agents: bupropion (WellbutrinŽ, Wellbutrin SRŽ, Wellbutrin XLŽ); duloxetine (CymbaltaŽ); mirtazapine (RemeronŽ, RemeronSolTabŽ); venlafaxine (EffexorŽ, Effexor XRŽ)

antidepressant medication. When psychosis, suicidal ideation, or severe functional impairment is present, medication is usually needed and hospitalization may be required.

ˇ Symptoms that are not caused by substance or medication use or abuse or by a general medical condition (Table 10). Other symptoms of GAD include myalgias, trembling, jumpiness, headache, dysphagia, gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhea, sweating, hot flashes, and feeling lightheaded and breathless.67,68 Patients suffering from GAD may feel chronically tense, anxious, and/or be disproportionately consumed with worry66; expect the worst on a consistent basis; and experience physical symptoms of anxiety,67 chronic anxiety symptoms with short-term exacerbations,66 and anxiety to a degree that it adversely affects daily functioning.65 The short-term treatment goal is to rapidly reduce somatic symptoms and overwhelming anxiety; long-term

Table 9. Assess for Risk of Suicide
If the response to question 9 on the PHQ-9 is positive, you must evaluate the patient's risk for suicide by assessing his or her thoughts and plans. Detecting suicidal ideation can be lifesaving. Asking patients about suicidal thoughts or plans will not initiate suicidal thoughts, planning, or action.60

dependence or loss of control over intake that characterize addiction. It is manifested by 1 or more of the following in the same 12-month period: ˇ Failure to fulfill obligations at work, school, or home as a result of the abuse. ˇ Use in physically hazardous situations (such as driving). ˇ Recurrent legal problems as a consequence of the abuse. ˇ Continued use despite persistent or recurring social problems. Substance dependence (addiction) Dependence involves a preoccupation with a substance and diminished control over its consumption. The hallmarks of dependence are tolerance and withdrawal, and dependence is manifested by 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period: ˇ Symptoms of tolerance--using increased amount with the same or diminished effect. ˇ Symptoms of withdrawal after stopping substance use. ˇ Desire and unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use. ˇ A great deal of time spent engaged in activities needed to obtain the substance. ˇ Neglect or abandonment of work, social, or recreational activities as a result of the use. ˇ Continued use despite health problems and negative social consequences. Screen patients for problem drinking and substance use with the CAGE-Adapted to Include Drugs (CAGE-AID) Test (Table 11). For patients with unhealthy drinking levels or drug abuse, clinicians should use the brief intervention technique.76,77 Brief intervention is a 5-step counseling technique that primary care practitioners can use to help their patients reduce unhealthy drinking: ˇ Provide clear, personalized advice about cutting down or abstaining. ˇ Listen reflectively--summarize and repeat what your patient says. Show concern and avoid confrontation--be on your patient's side. When possible, link alcohol/drug use to a specific medical condition. ˇ Set mutually acceptable goals--involve your patient. ˇ Patients may be unwilling to abstain from drinking/drug use completely, but may agree to reduce consumption.

Assess for suicidal thoughts and plans:
"Have you ever felt that life is not worth living?" "Did you ever wish you could go to sleep and just not wake up?" "Are you imagining that others would be better off without you?" "Are you having thoughts about killing yourself?"

Assess for suicide risks including:
ˇ Prior suicide attempts (best indicator of future attempts) ˇ Psychiatric comorbidity and substance use disorders ˇ Access to firearms ˇ Living alone ˇ Poor social support ˇ Male and elderly ˇ Recent loss or separation ˇ Hopelessness

If the patient is actively thinking of suicide, has made an attempt in the past, or has a plan for another attempt, arrange for mental health consultation as soon as possible or call 911 for emergency intervention.60,61

goals include full recovery, preventing relapses, and treating any comorbid disorder.68

Substance Use Disorders
Exposure to stress and trauma may increase the risk of substance use, substance use disorders, or relapse. Substance use disorders involve extended overuse of a substance marked by persistent cravings, increased tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms. Use characteristically continues despite resulting serious, persistent, and recurring psychological, physical, and social problems.73,74 During the weeks and months following the WTC attack, cigarette and marijuana use increased in NYC adults,22 and there was a correlation between exposure to the attacks and alcohol dependence.26,75 Substance abuse Substance abuse is a pattern of use that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress but without the physical

Treatment
Rule out other possible causes for the symptoms before beginning any form of treatment for GAD. ˇ Organic causes for anxiety include undiagnosed medical disorders such as hyperthyroidism, arrhythmias, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders, coronary insufficiency, and pheochromocytoma. ˇ Medication, as well as drugs and alcohol, caffeine, nicotine and cocaine (whether during intoxication or withdrawal), can cause or exacerbate anxiety symptoms.

ˇ Cognitive-behavioral therapy. ˇ Relaxation therapy: to develop techniques to effectively deal with stress.

Pharmacotherapy47,50,52,60
The aim of pharmacotherapy is the management of the anxiety symptoms. Antidepressants are effective for GAD (see Pharmacotherapy in Table 8). Escitalopram (LexaproŽ), paroxetine (PaxilŽ), and venlafaxine (EffexorŽ) are approved by the FDA for the treatment of GAD. If needed, anxiolytics (benzodiazepines)* for prompt relief of symptoms: ˇ Alprazolam (XanaxŽ) ˇ Diazepam (ValiumŽ) ˇ Chlorazepate (TranxeneŽ) ˇ Lorazepam (AtivanŽ) ˇ Clonazepam (KlonopinŽ) ˇ Oxazepam (SeraxŽ) *Benzodiazepines have the potential for abuse and dependence when used for

ˇ Offer practical advice, information, and treatment referrals. ˇ Help patients identify drinking/drug use triggers and practical ways to cope. Common triggers include job stress, money worries, chronic illness, family problems, depression, anxiety, and social isolation. ˇ Prescribe medication if indicated. ˇ Three medications--naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram --have been approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone are effective treatments for opioid dependence. ˇ Provide regular follow-up to support efforts to reduce or stop drinking or abusing drugs. Primary care providers play an important role in creating a treatment plan and supporting the patient in locating the appropriate program, support service, or network. Comprehensive care is critical, including addressing medical needs, monitoring progress, referring or consulting specialists, motivating the patient to change his/her lifestyle, maintaining remission and reducing the risk of relapse.74,76 Three or 4 follow-up visits (or a combination of visits and phone support) increase the effectiveness of brief intervention.78
Preventive health measures recommended for people with a history of WTC-related illnesses
ˇ Tobacco cessation and elimination of exposure to secondhand smoke are essential to control asthma/RADS and GERD/ LPRD, and to prevent some cancers and other diseases. ˇ Counsel the patient to avoid occupational or recreational exposures that are known to exacerbate the illnesses. ˇ Annual influenza vaccination is advised to reduce the risk of complications of influenza infection. ˇ Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for those with pulmonary disease. ˇ Diet modification and weight control are integral to the control of GERD. ˇ Screening for depression and substance use disorders is recommended during routine visits. If patients screen positive, appropriate counseling and referral should be provided.

Table 11. Substance Use Screening and Treatment
Screening76
Ask the patient about current and past nicotine, alcohol, or other substance use.

Brief counseling may be further reinforced by visits with or phone calls from health care professionals or alcohol counselors. Patients with substance use disorders require ongoing care: monitoring, intervention, relapseprevention, and referrals to improve treatment outcome. Relapse is common. Exposure to stress increases cravings and therefore the likelihood of a relapse.79 Treatment planning should support the patient by addressing acute medical needs, monitoring progress, consulting specialists or referring the patient to specialists, and motivating the patient to make lifestyle changes.

SUMMARY
Seven years after the terrorist attacks, New Yorkers and others throughout the country still experience WTCassociated physical and mental illnesses. All providers can play an important role in evaluating and treating these illnesses. Primary care providers can also address mental health problems when evaluating patients for respiratory ailments and other health problems. These guidelines supply information on how to diagnose, treat, and, if necessary, refer patients for additional evaluation and treatment. However, the guidelines do not consider all WTC-associated illnesses, and providers should monitor the literature as more information on WTC-associated disease becomes available.

CAGE­AID (Adapted to Include Drugs) Test78
Have you ever:
ˇ Thought you should... Cut down your drinking or drug use? ˇ Become... ˇ Felt bad or... ˇ Taken an... Annoyed when people criticized your drinking or drug use? Guilty about your drinking or drug use? Eye-opener drink or used a drug to feel better in the morning?

YES to 1 or 2 questions = Possible alcohol/drug use problem YES to 3 or 4 questions = Probable alcohol/drug dependence

Physical and mental health problems in people exposed to the disaster are often interrelated and require coordinated evaluation and treatment.
FIGURE 1
The algorithm provides guidance for diagnosis, treatment, management, and referral to a World Trade Center monitoring or treatment program, or to another specialist (e.g. otolaryngologist, pulmonologist, cardiologist, radiologist, or gastroenterologist). Often, two or more conditions coexist, and these conditions must be treated simultaneously to improve or resolve the respiratory symptoms.80

Management Guidelines for Glucocorticoids
Iris G. Udasin M.D., University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program

Objectives: Identification of WTC related conditions requiring the use of glucocorticoids for treatment. II. Define duration (long term/short term) and dosage (high dose/low dose) of glucocorticoids for treatment of WTC related conditions III. Identify conditions which satisfy criteria for medical coverage under the World Trade Center treatment program I. Statement: The WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program has examined more than 24,000 responders. At least 50% of these patients require treatment for their World Trade related health conditions. Seven years after exposure, almost half (49%) receive treatment for lower respiratory conditions and almost three quarters (73%) receive treatment for upper respiratory problems. The purpose of this document is to delineate the process used to identify secondary (new) WTC-related conditions which occur as a consequence of conventional treatment of an already established WTC-related condition. In order for a new condition to be considered WTC-related/covered, (1) the patient must be diagnosed with a WTC- related condition which requires treatment, (2) medications used to treat the condition have been shown to cause specific systemic side effects (secondary conditions) as documented in evidenced based medical literature, and (3) these specific side effects were not present prior to the onset of treatment of the primary WTC- related condition. Because of the high prevalence of upper and lower respiratory diagnoses in WTC responders, a significant number of patients require either systemic or topical glucocorticoid treatment. Unfortunately, therapeutic dosages of these medications have been well documented to cause significant adverse health effects. Steroids may be administered topically/inhaled or systemically. Topical/inhaled steroid use has not been reported to cause systemic illness unless dosages exceed 1000ug of beclomethasone or equivalent per day. However, topical or inhaled use may cause localized effects such as irritation, epistaxis, etc. Systemic high dose steroid use is defined as 15mg per day or more of prednisone or equivalent. Low dose systemic steroid use is considered 7.5mg of prednisone or equivalent. Long term steroid use involves treatment greater than or equal to 3 months, and short term is treatment for less than 3 months. Conditions such as avascular necrosis can potentially require extensive surgery including hip or knee replacement. Other chronic conditions may require expensive pharmaceutical treatment over the course of a patient's life time. As a result of this review, the Principal Investigators have identified musculoskeletal, ophthalmic, and mental health conditions that are directly caused by steroid therapy for primary World

Udasin, Iris G.

Trade Center related conditions. Specific conditions that should be covered assuming they fit the diagnostic criteria specified in the document include: Avascular necrosis, osteoporosis, myopathy, glaucoma, cataracts, and mood disorder. Avascular necrosis and glaucoma have even been documented with short term use of low dose steroids. The other conditions specified require either long term usage or high dosage in order to be considered `covered'. Additional conditions may be covered in the future. Appendix I includes evidenced based medical conditions which may be associated with glucocorticoid usage which do not fulfill the above criteria and are not currently covered at this time. Appendix II identifies preventive strategies to decrease complications of WTC related medical conditions as a result of steroid usage. I. WTC related medical conditions potentially requiring the use of steroids: A. Systemic steroids 1. Asthma 2. RADS 3. WTC-related exacerbation of COPD 4. WTC-related interstitial lung disease 5. Other conditions under review by WTC steering committee B. Topical steroids (inhaled and nasal): 1. Asthma 2. Chronic cough 3. Chronic laryngitis 4. Chronic rhinitis 5. Chronic sinusitis 6. Nasopharyngitis 7. RADS 8. Upper airway hyper reactivity 9. WTC related exacerbation of COPD II. Definitions of glucocorticoid usage: A. Short term duration and/or low dose usage 1. Less than three months 2. Less than or equal to 7.5 mg prednisone or equivalent/day 3. Less than 1000ug of beclomethasone or equivalent/day B. Long term duration and/or high dose usage 1. Greater than or equal to three months 2. Greater than 15mg/day prednisone or equivalent (note7.5to15mg is a gray area or intermediate dosage, not well commented on in the literature) 3. Greater than 15mg/day prednisone or equivalent (note 7.5 to 15mg is a gray area or intermediate dosage, not well commented on in the literature) 4. Greater than or equal to 1000ug/day of beclomethasone

Appendix I: Adverse effects not clearly related to steroid use and not covered at the present time: A. Short term duration and/or low dose 1. Cardiovascular: Hypertension 2. Gastrointestinal: Dyspepsia, GERD, pancreatitis, upper GI bleed. 3. Hematologic: Leukocytosis 4. Infectious: Candidiasis 5. Metabolic/Endocrine: Na/water retention, hypokalemic alkalosis, glucose intolerance, increased BUN/creatinine ratio. 6. Psychiatric: (can be seen in the first week of use): Disturbed affect (euphoria, hypomania), disturbed cognition, delirium, psychosis. B. Long term use/high dose (includes all adverse effects listed under short term usage as well as the following additional effects): 1. Cardiovascular: Accelerated atherosclerosis 2. Dermatologic: Acne, alopecia, hirsutism, skin thinning/slower wound healing, easy bruising. 3. Gastrointestinal: Peptic ulcer disease, fatty liver. 4. Hematologic: Neutrophilia, lymphopenia. 5. Infectious: Immunosuppression/opportunistic infections. 6. Metabolic/endocrine: Diabetes mellitus, amenorrhea/irregular menses, obesity, hypothalamic pituitary axis suppression, hyperlipidemia, loss of K+ and Ca++, Cushing's syndrome. 7. Neurologic: Pseudo tumor cerebri. Note: There are no reported clinically significant long term systemic effects seen with low or moderate uses of inhaled corticosteroids or nasal steroids. Short term health effects include skin bruising/thinning, hoarseness/dysphonia, oral candidiasis, esophageal candidiasis, and tongue hypertrophy. These effects usually resolve when steroids are discontinued. Appendix II: Preventive strategies to lessen glucocorticoid- induced health effects: A. Use as low a dose as possible of both systemic and/or inhaled glucocorticoids B. Screen patients as early as possible for bone loss/ osteoporosis C. Preventive and early treatment of osteoporosis. D. Add beta agonist if tolerated before increasing steroid dosage (note this strategy might not be useful in patients with known hypertension or heart disease E. Use spacer devices and rinse after use of inhaled corticosteroids F. Be concerned with other preventive strategies to reduce respiratory illness, i.e., smoking cessation, treatment of allergies, influenza vaccine. G. Use of nasal saline rinses to treat upper respiratory conditions

Obstructive Sleep Apnea Management Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) coverage is approved if OSA is present as a complicating condition of one of the following already covered WTC conditions: GERD, Chronic Rhinosinusitis, and/or Vocal Cord Dysfunction. OSA without a WTC condition is NOT covered. There is not yet sufficient evidence to cover other sleep conditions. WTC Physical Health and OSA Coverage A. Condition: GERD, Chronic Rhinosinusitis, and/or Vocal Cord Dysfunction Treatment for WTC condition: Maximized Suspicion for OSA: High after administering questionnaire Plan: (1) Continue with individual optimized treatment regimen for WTC conditions (GERD, Chronic Rhinosinusitis, Vocal Cord Dysfunction) (2) Cover and perform Sleep Study a. if moderate to severe OSA then positive pressure mask therapy can be prescribed (CPAP or BIPAP) and covered under the WTC program. If mild OSA all attempts at optimizing treatment of World Trade Center conditions should be made. If mild OSA sleep treatment will not be covered. b. Recommend Sleep Specialist Referral (3) If the BMI is > or = 30 or there has been a 10% increase in weight over the last year then a recommended three consultations with a nutritionist for weight reduction is covered, additional consultations with a nutritionist will be covered at the discretion of the PI. Specialized food or surgery for obesity will not be covered. WTC Mental Health and OSA Coverage B. Condition: Mental Health Problem Treatment for WTC Condition: Maximized Suspicion for OSA: High after administering questionnaire Plan:

(1) (2)

(3)

Condition has been maximally treated and there is an appropriate balance between medicating for underlying disease and minimizing fatigue/sleep side-effects Cover and perform Sleep Study a. if moderate to severe OSA then positive pressure mask therapy can be prescribed (CPAP or BIPAP) and covered under the WTC program. If mild OSA all attempts at optimizing treatment of World Trade Center conditions should be made. If mild OSA sleep treatment will not be covered. b. Recommend Sleep Specialist Referral If the BMI is > or = 30 or there has been a 10% increase in weight over the last year then a recommended three consultations with a nutritionist for weight reduction is covered, additional consultations with a nutritionist will be covered at the discretion of the PI. Specialized food or surgery for obesity will not be covered.

Sleep Study Categories: Split test, Diagnostic test, Titration test. Preference: Split test as we are covering OSA and not other sleep diagnoses. In only special circumstances should home tests be approved and only after consultation between the PI and the sleep expert at that institution. Goal: Specific type of Sleep test should be sufficient for either diagnosing or treating OSA appropriately. Exceptional cases: 1. OSA surgery (ex:UVPP) is not covered unless the patient has failed other therapy, has life threatening disease and the PI approves the therapy. 2. Repeat sleep studies are not covered unless there has been a change in the condition - ex. change in BMI by at least 10%, change in underlying covered conditions, etc.

3. Dental appliances are not covered. In general they are used in circumstances where there are jaw malformations and by definition that is not WTC related.

Qualifying Specific Health Conditions for Program Services (Treatment and/or Health Surveillance), by Coding from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th version (WHO)

NOTE: Each qualifying health condition must be certified by the WTC Program Administrator for treatment services to be reimbursed by the WTC Health Program. Certification will require a physician determination providing rationale and documentation that a given health condition meets the criteria of a "WTC-related health condition" or a "health condition medically associated with a WTC-related health condition" (see definitions).

Rating Guidelines Quality of Product or Service
0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding

Unsatisfactory Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards containing similar requirements. Poor Fair Good Excellent Overall compliance requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements. Overall compliance requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements. There are no, or very minimal, quality problems, and the Contractor has met the contract requirements. There are no quality issues, and the Contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements without commensurate additional costs to the Government. The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated achievements and is commendable as an example for others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".

Outstanding

Cost Control
0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding

Unsatisfactory Ability to manage cost issues is jeopardizing performance of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, this level of ability to manage cost issues constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards. Poor Fair Good Excellent Ability to manage cost issues requires significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements. Ability to control cost issues requires minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements. There are no, or very minimal, cost management issues and the Contractor has met the contract requirements. There are no cost management issues and the Contractor has exceeded the contract requirements, achieving cost savings to the Government. The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where the contractor achieved cost savings and performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".

Timeliness of Performance
0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding

Unsatisfactory Delays are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of Agency resources. Recovery is not likely. If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in consideration for future awards. Poor Fair Good Excellent Outstanding Delays require significant Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements. Delays require minor Agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements. There are no, or minimal, delays that impact achievement of contract requirements. There are no delays and the contractor has exceeded the agreed upon time schedule. The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score. It is expected that this rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as "Excellent".

Business Relations
0 = Unsatisfactory 1 = Poor 2 = Fair 3 = Good 4 = Excellent 5 = Outstanding

Unsatisfactory Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is not effective. If not substantially mitigated or corrected it should constitute a significant impediment in considerations for future awards. Poor Fair Good Excellent Outstanding Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is marginally effective. Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is somewhat effective. Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues is consistently effective. Response to inquiries and/or technical, service, administrative issues exceeds Government expectation. The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that justifies adding a point to the score.

Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or
offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  “SUBCONTRACT,” as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-
employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor requesting supplies or services required for
performance of the contract or subcontract.

If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the Small Business Specialist (SBS) supporting the OPDIV.  SBS contact
information is located on the OSDBU website (http://www.hhs.gov/about/smallbusiness/osdbustaff.html) or you may contact the OSDBU headquarters
at (202) 690-7300.

HHS current subcontracting goal is 28.0% for small business (hereafter referred to as SB), 5.00% for Small Disadvantaged Business, including
8(a) Program Participants,  Alaska Native Corporations (ANC) and Indian Tribes (hereafter referred to as SDB), 5.00% for women-owned business
and economically disadvantaged women-owned business (hereafter referred to as WOSB), 3.00% HubZone business (hereafter referred to as HUBZone),
3.00% Veteran Owned Small Business (hereafter referred to as VOSB) and 3.00% service disabled veteran-owned small business (hereafter referred
to as SDVOSB) concerns for Fiscal Year (FY) 2011.  For this procurement, HHS expects all proposed subcontracting plans to contain at a minimum
the aforementioned percentages.
These percentages shall be expressed as percentages of the total estimated subcontracting dollars.

   1. Type of Plan (check one)


      _____ Individual plan (all elements developed specifically for this contract and applicable for the full term of this contract).


      _____ Master plan (goals developed for this contract) all other elements standardized and approved by a lead agency Federal Official; must
      be renewed every three years and contractor must provide copy of lead agency approval.


      _____ Commercial products/service plan (goals are negotiated with the initial agency on a company-wide basis rather than for individual
      contracts) this plan applies to the entire production of commercial service or items or a portion thereof. The contractor sells commercial
      products and services customarily used for non-government purposes.  The plan is effective during the offeror’s fiscal year (attach a
      copy).   The Summary Subcontracting Report (SSR) must include a breakout of subcontracting prorated for HHS and other Federal agencies.

fiscal year ending 9/30.

     a. Submit ISR (bi-annually) for the awarding Contracting Officer’s review and acceptance via the eSRS website.


     b.   Currently, SSR (annually) must be submitted for the HHS eSRS Agency Coordinator review and acceptance via the eSRS website.  (Note:
         Log onto the OSDBU website to view the HHS Agency Coordinator contact information
         (http://www.hhs.gov/about/smallbusiness/osdbustaff.html).


Note:  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will indicate whether a subcontracting plan is required.  Due to the nature and complexity of many HHS
contracts, particularly the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), the contractor may not be required to submit its subcontracting reports
through the eSRS.   The Contracting Officer will confirm reporting requirements prior to the issuance of an award.  For more information,
contact Teneshia Alston, Agency Coordinator-eSRS (Teneshia.Alston@HHS.GOV).

7.  Record keeping

FAR 19.704(a) (11) requires a list of the types of records your company will maintain to demonstrate the procedures adopted to comply with the
requirements and goals in the subcontracting plan.  The following is a recitation of the types of records the contractor will maintain to
demonstrate the procedures adopted to comply with the requirements and goals in the subcontracting plan.  These records will include, but not be
limited to, the following:

     a. SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB source lists, guides and other data identifying such vendors;

     b. Organizations contacted in an attempt to locate SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB sources;

     c. On a contract-by-contract basis, records on all subcontract solicitations over $100,000, which indicate for each solicitation (1)
        whether SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and/or SDVOSB concerns were solicited, if not, why not and the reasons solicited concerns did not
        receive subcontract awards;


     d. Records to support other outreach efforts, e.g., contacts with minority and small business trade associations, attendance at small and
        minority business procurement conferences and trade fairs;

     e. Records to support internal guidance and encouragement provided to buyers through (1) workshops, seminars, training programs, incentive
        awards; and (2) monitoring performance to evaluate compliance with the program and requirements; and

     f. On a contract-by-contract basis, records to support subcontract award data including the name, address, and business type and size of
        each subcontractor. (This is not required on a contract–by–contract basis for commercial plans.)
     g. Other records to support your compliance with the subcontracting plan: (Please describe)
        _____________________________________________________________


        _____________________________________________________________


        _____________________________________________________________


8.  Timely Payments to Subcontractors

FAR 19.702 requires your company to establish and use procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of your
subcontracts with SB concerns, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB concerns.

Your company has established and used such procedures:  ________ yes _________ no


9.  Description of Good Faith Effort

Maximum practicable utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB concerns as subcontractors in Government contracts is a matter of
national interest with both social and economic benefits.  When a contractor fails to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting
plan, these objectives are not achieved, and 15 U.S.C. 637(d) (4) (F) directs that liquidated damages shall be paid by the contractor.  In order
to demonstrate your compliance with a good faith effort to achieve the SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB and SDVOSB small business subcontracting
goals, outline the steps your company plans to take.  These steps will be negotiated with the contracting official prior to approval of the
plan.

Examples of Standardized Assessment Forms

J-6 Exposure Assessment for Responder Monitoring J-7 MHQ for the Medical Monitoring Examination J-8 Initial Health Evaluation for Community Survivor

These instruments were designed to systematically and consistently assess WTC disaster exposure and the time of onset and progression of medical complaints. The content of these tools arose from previously standardized and validated instruments, where possible. For enrolled responders, the initial screening evaluation began in 2002 and evolved into an annual medical monitoring examination. The first responder examination evaluates the potential for hazardous occupational exposure (J-6) due to a responder's disaster work assignments. The medical history tool (J-7) assesses the body systems likely to be affected by the disaster work environment and screens for conditions that require a longer latency to appear clinically after adverse exposure. These instruments were utilized as part of a standardized protocol to enable the data to be used for health surveillance purposes to inform public health policy and program determinations. Qualifying survivors, previously called community members, were given an initial health evaluation (J-8) to evaluate environmental exposure and the body systems likely to be affected by such exposure. This had been conducted as a screening program to identify those in need of further clinical evaluation and treatment for qualifying WTC-related disease.

Exposure Assessment Interviewer: Subject ID________ Exam Date

Section 1. Occupational history pre-9/11/01
First, I want to ask you about your work history. The purpose is to get a better understanding of the different kinds of trades or occupations you have held jobs in since age 16. We want to know about all trades or occupations you've held whether part-time or full-time, paid or unpaid, including volunteer work at which you spent more than 5 hours per week, and any job held in the military. List only professions for which there has been an exposure, and which was held for at least a year. List only hobbies that are engaged in at least a few times a month, and for which there has been an exposure. For example, someone might currently work as a police officer, but in the past worked as a carpenter for 10 years, truck driver for 2, and busboy for 5, and worked as a carpenter for 4 years in the military. This person has had 4 different occupations. We don't need to know how many different employers you have had or about specific jobs or projects unless you were actually doing something under a different trade or occupation.

Did you bring in the questionnaire that we sent you in the mail? If you brought this questionnaire, let's look at it together to help jog your memory and so I can ask questions to help clarify your experience. Review "mail-home" questionnaire for main trades or occupations. If multiple jobs in the same trade/occupation are listed, try to summarize. Go through each different trade/occupation sequentially and complete a copy of Table 1 for each trade/occupation. Let's talk about your first trade or occupation after age 16.

Be sure to ask whether there are any additional jobs, volunteer work, or military positions they held in other trades or occupations. When you have completed a copy of Table 1 for all jobs prior to 9/11/01, Let's review the work you've been doing since you stopped your WTC work/volunteering. Review the "mail-home" questionnaire to see if they have identified any trades/occupations after their WTC work/volunteering. If the "mail-home" questionnaire does not identify any trades/occupations after their WTC work/volunteering: You didn't identify any trades/occupations after your WTC work/volunteering.

Section 3. Exposure from WTC work/volunteering
Now I want to get a sense of your WTC work/volunteering experience. I will be asking you about whether you worked as a volunteer or employee, whether you worked/volunteered during the first month after the attack, and about your general experience from September through June 2002. Because the conditions changed over time, and because your work activities might also have changed over time, I will be asking you about your experience by 4 distinct periods of time. We set these periods in order to make it easier for workers to recall their experience. I will also give you a calendar of the past year to help jog your memory. The 4 periods are: ˇ September (during the rescue and recovery period) ˇ October (during the rescue and recovery period) ˇ November through December (during the start-up of the recovery period and when the fires went out) ˇ January through June (during the final phases of recovery and clean-up)

Section 5. Personal Protective Equipment
This is the last section. I want ask you some specific questions about the kinds of personal protective equipment (PPE) that you used during the time that you worked/volunteered and about the training you received concerning that equipment. To help you answer some of these questions, I am going to show you a picture of the different types of personal protective equipment. 5.1 Did you attend any training about respirators? 5.2 Did you attend any other training? record all that apply

If No to 5.1 or 5.2 What was your main reason for not attending any training?

Review Section 3 for work/volunteering duration; if the subject worked/volunteered during 9/11-9/18 inclusive, You were on site during the first week after the attack from the subject's first day between 9/11-9/18. During this first week (up to 9/18), what kind of respirator did you wear? If the subject wore a respirator with cartridges, During the first week, did you change your cartridge daily? Did you ever wear a dust/surgical/disposable mask at any time while working/volunteering? See Picture If Yes, When did you first start wearing it? Did you ever wear a half-face or full-face cartridge respirator at any time while working/volunteering? If Yes, When did you first start wearing it? Were you ever fit-checked for your half-face or full-face respirator? Another name for a fit check is a seal check. It involves checking the positive and negative pressure of your respirator by putting your hands over the cartridges and over the outlet valve.

Exposure Assessment Questionnaire V23.doc

WTC Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program
Exposure Assessment Were you ever fit-tested for your half-face or full-face respirator? There are 2 types of fit-tests. For both, you wear the respirator while you do short exercises (like looking from side to side). One type of fit test involves a device that measures the amount of dust inside the respirator and compares it to the amount outside the respirator. In another type of fit-test, you put a hood over your head (while wearing the respirator). An irritant smoke, banana oil, or saccharine is sprayed into the hood. If you don't detect the smoke, etc. while you are doing the exercises (talking, etc.) then the respirator fits you. How long was it between you getting your first respirator and receiving the training Were you told at any time that you were using a respirator that was the wrong size? Were you told at any time that you were using a respirator that had the wrong type of cartridges in it?

Section C - Description/Specification/Work Statement
C.1 Background Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have facilitated health evaluations for workers involved with response, recovery or clean-up operations at the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster sites. These workers have since been collectively referred to as WTC "responders". Health screening examinations for WTC responders began in 2002 under contracts awarded to Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM) and the Fire Department of New York (FDNY). MSSM subcontracted with other specialty occupational health clinics in New York City (NYC) metropolitan area to expand capacity and provide a standardized and comprehensive health screening protocol. The screening protocol included a medical history questionnaire (physical and mental health), an exposure assessment questionnaire, a physical examination, a lung function test, a chest radiograph, and routine analyses of blood and urine. The program also provided occupational health education, social benefits counseling, and clinical referral services as required. Participants were recruited through outreach efforts that included community and labor union meetings, mailings, and other media-related outlets. Congress appropriated funding in FY 2003 to implement longer term medical monitoring for these WTC responders. The occupational health specialty clinics involved in the screening program were then each directly funded to work collaboratively and provide periodic standardized medical monitoring exams beginning in 2004. Participants in the screening program were automatically enrolled in this program. In 2006, Congress appropriated funds for diagnostic and treatment services to support medical care for health conditions associated with WTC-related work exposures. The targeted work-related health conditions covered under the program were scientifically determined through the experience of caring for health needs of the responders and with input from experts in pertinent fields of science and medicine. The WTC-related health conditions include certain upper and lower airway diseases, esophageal disorders from acid reflux, musculoskeletal injuries, and mental health problems (most notably posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression). The program was re-named the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP) to reflect expanded services to the eligible responders. The planned interval between monitoring exams was decreased from 18 to 12 months to enable earlier detection and intervention for the high rates of illness detected. The intended goal was to minimize organ damage/disability and improve quality of life for those affected. The established program clinical sites were termed the Clinical Centers of Excellence reflecting their multidisciplinary expertise and extensive program experience with the WTC responder population. Monitoring exams and treatment were also made available to responders living outside the greater NYC area and geographically distant from the established clinical centers. These "national responders" received services through numerous subcontracted providers with philanthropic funding initially and then with federal funding. Monitoring and treatment services for national responders were combined in 2008 into a single contract service award to manage the WTC National Responder Health Program (NRHP). In 2008, Congress appropriated funds for initial health evaluations, diagnostic and treatment services for residents, students, and others who were exposed to the aftermath related to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City. This funding expanded services that had been started by New York City. Originally this program was referred to as the Community Program, but it is now called the Survivor Program. Table C.1-1 provides information on current enrollment and participation in the WTC Health Programs.

Clinical Centers of Excellence There are currently seven Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCEs) that provide medical monitoring examinations, diagnosis, and treatment services for the WTC-related health conditions. One CCE serves the FDNY Responders, five CCEs serve the NY/NJ Consortium Responders, and one CCE serves Survivors. Treatment services include physician visits, test procedures, medical devices, pharmacy benefits, case management, health education, and social service counseling. The CCEs work as a clinical consortium with standardized medical monitoring protocols, clinical presentations, and programmatic decision-making across the practice sites. The CCEs are actively engaged with labor representatives and members of the New York City community to discuss program policies and ensure awareness of emerging issues. Data Centers There are currently two Data Centers (DC) in the responder program that collect, analyze, and report data. The Community Program has similar data activities. These data related functions involve creation and maintenance of uniform data sets in coordination with their corresponding Clinical Centers. Other functions include maintaining a manual of procedures, protocols, data collection forms, and a reporting structure for monitoring and treatment services. James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 On January 2, 2011, the President signed into law the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Zadroga Act). Title I of the Zadroga Act established within the Department of Health and Human Services the World Trade Center Health Program (WTC Health Program). The WTC Health Program includes the following components: 1. Medical monitoring for responders Enrolled refers only to individuals who met eligibility criteria to be included in the programs, but not all individuals have decided to participate in their respective monitoring programs after enrolling. 2 The number of patients in treatment are those responders who have been referred from a monitoring exam for follow-up care and received any treatment in the past year. 3 NY/NJ Consortium responders are those seen in the following five clinical centers of excellence: Bellevue Hospital/New York University School of Medicine, City University of New York/Queens College, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, State University of New York at Stony Brook, and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey/Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. 4 Federal funding for the Survivor Program began on September 29, 2008, at which time there were 2,759 enrolled.

No person other than the Contracting Officer can make any changes to the terms, conditions, general provisions, or other stipulations of this contract. (b) No information, other than that which may be contained in an authorized modification to this contract, duly issued by the Contracting Officer, which may be received from any person employed by the United States Government, or otherwise, shall be considered grounds for deviation from any stipulation of this contract. (End of Clause) G.2 Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) Technical Guidance (Sep 2009) Performance of the work hereunder shall be subject to the technical directions of the designated COTR for this contract. As used herein, technical directions are directions to the Contractor which fill in details, suggests possible lines of inquiry, or otherwise completes the general scope of work set forth herein. These technical directions must be within the general scope of work, and may not alter the scope of work or cause changes of such a nature as to justify an adjustment in the stated contract price/cost, or any stated limitation thereof. In the event that the Contractor feels that full implementation of any of these directions may exceed the scope of the contract, he or she shall notify the originator of the technical direction and the Contracting Officer in a letter separate of any required report(s) within two (2) weeks of the date of receipt of the technical direction and no action shall be taken pursuant to the direction. If the Contractor fails to provide the required notification within the said two (2) week period that any technical direction exceeds the scope of the contract, then it shall be deemed for purposes of this contract that the technical direction was within the scope. No technical direction, nor its fulfillment, shall alter or abrogate the rights and obligations fixed in this contract.

Section H - Special Contract Requirements
H.1 Lobbying Prohibition Using Federal Funds (Sep 2009) The contractor is hereby notified of the restrictions on the use of Department of Health and Human Service's funding for lobbying of Federal, State and Local legislative bodies. Section 1352 of Title 10, United Stated Code (Public Law 101-121, effective 12/23/89), among other things, prohibits a recipient (and their subcontractors) of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement from using appropriated funds (other than profits from a federal contract) to pay any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with any of the following covered Federal actions; the awarding of any Federal contract; the making of any Federal grant; the making of any Federal loan; the entering into of any cooperative agreement; or the modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement. For additional information of prohibitions against lobbying activities, see FAR Subpart 3.8 and FAR Clause 52.203-12. In addition, the current Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act provides that no part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be used, other than for normal and recognized executive-legislative relationships, for publicity or propaganda purposes, for the preparation, distribution, or use of any kit, pamphlet, booklet, publication, radio, television, or video presentation designed to support, or defeat legislation pending before the Congress, or any State or Local legislature except in presentation to the Congress, or any State or Local legislative body itself. The current Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act also provides that no part of any appropriation contained in this Act shall be used to pay the salary or expenses of any contract or grant recipient, or agent acting for such recipient, related to any activity designed to influence legislation or appropriations pending before the Congress, or any State or Local legislature. (End of Clause) H.2 Smoke Free Working Environment (May 2009) In compliance with HHS regulations, all contractor personnel performing work within CDC/ATSDR facilities shall observe the CDC/ATSDR smoke-free working environment policy at all times. This policy prohibits smoking in all CDC/ATSDR buildings and in front of buildings which are open to the public. This policy is also applicable to contractor personnel who do not work full-time within CDC/ATSDR facilities, but are attending meetings within CDC/ATSDR facilities. (End of Clause) H.3 Representations and Certifications (Sep 2009) The Representations, Certifications and Other Statements of Offerors submitted by ORCA dated [offeror insert ORCA date if submission of representations and certifications via ORCA is applicable] are hereby incorporated by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. (End of Clause) H.4 Dissemination of Information (May 1998) No information related to data obtained under this contract shall be released or publicized without the prior written consent of the COTR. (End of Clause)

31

H.5 Identification of Data (May 1998) The Contractor shall identify the technical data delivered to the Government as required by this contract with the number of the contract and the name and address of the Contractor or subcontractor that generated the data. (End of Clause) H.6 Review and Comment (May 1998) All materials developed or information of whatever nature resulting from work performed under this contract shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) for review and comment prior to publication or dissemination. (End of Clause) H.7 Record Retention The Contractor is responsible for records retention and CDC/NIOSH is not implementing a document destruction program authorizing the destruction of medical documents. However, in an effort to reduce associated costs for storing medical documents, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has agreed that electronic imaging is an acceptable method of storage. This provides contractors the opportunity to destroy the paper documents, as long as the following conditions are met: (1) Contractors must certify the image is absolutely an identical replication of the paper document in every way; (2) The scanned image becomes the record keeping copy and is verified and documented as an identical replication of the paper document; and (3) Contractors must maintain accessibility and the ability to read the document in accordance with changes in technology. Under no circumstances are contractors to destroy the only copy of any information, data, or files that CDC/NIOSH, DOJ, DHHS' Office of General Counsel or the OIG have identified as relating to a current investigation or litigation/negotiation, ongoing Workers' Compensation set aside arrangements, or documents which prompt suspicions of fraud or abuse of over utilization of services. Contractors can either retain the image copy or the hardcopy. This will satisfy evidentiary needs and discovery obligations critical to the agency's litigation interest. H.8 Use of Government Data (Reports/Files/Computer Tapes or Discs) Any data given to the contractor by the Government shall be used only for the performance of the contract unless the Contracting Officer specifically permits another use, in writing. Should the Contracting Officer permit the contractor the use of Government-supplied data for a purpose other than solely for performance of this contract and if such use could result in a commercially viable product, the Contracting Officer and the contractor must negotiate a financial benefit to the Government. This benefit should most often be in the form of a reduction in the price of the contract; however, the Contracting Officer may negotiate any other benefits he/she determines are adequate compensation for the use of these data. Upon the request of the Contracting Officer or the expiration date of this contract, whichever shall come first, the contractor shall, upon instructions from the Contracting Officer, return or destroy all data given to the contractor by the Government. However, the Contracting Officer may direct that the data be retained by the contractor for a specific period of time, which period shall be subject to agreement by the contractor. Whether the data are returned, retained, or destroyed shall be the decision of the Contracting Officer with the exception that the contractor may refuse to retain the data. The contractor shall retain no data, copies of data, or parts thereof, in any form, when the Contracting Officer directs that the data be returned or destroyed. If the data are to be destroyed, the contractor shall directly furnish evidence of such destruction in a form the Contracting Officer shall determine is adequate.

32

H.9 Privacy Act (Sep 2009) (a) Notification is hereby given that the Contractor and its employees are subject to criminal penalties for violation of the Privacy Act to the same extent as employees of the Government. The Contractor shall assure that each of its employees knows the prescribed rules of conduct and that each is aware that he or she can be subjected to criminal penalty for violation of the Act. A copy of 45 CFR Part 5b, Privacy Act Regulations, may be obtained at http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov. (b) The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) is hereby designated as the official who is responsible for monitoring contractor compliance with the Privacy Act. H.10 Data Subject to Confidentiality Requirements (May 1998) The type(s) of data subject to the clause at 352.224-70, Confidentiality of Information, which has been incorporated in full text in Section I, are as follows: To be determined by COTR Following are the requirements for handling these data: The contractor may retain a copy of the data in the duration of the contract but must turn over the entire dataset to CDC/NIOSH before the present contract expires. Other data (i.e., subject's consent form, questionnaires, and other signed documents) will be handled in the same manner. The contractor has no right to disclose the data in any form (conference presentation, journal articles, reports, product development) without the consent of CDC/NIOSH. CDC/NIOSH reserves the sole right to decide the authorship in any conference presentations, publications, and reports based on the present dataset. H.11 Data Collection Approval (May 1998) This contract involves a requirement to collect or record information calling either for answers to identical questions from 10 or more persons other than Federal employees, or information from Federal employees which is outside the scope of their employment, for use by the Federal government or disclosure to third parties; therefore, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104­13) shall apply to this contract. No plan, questionnaire, interview guide or other similar device for collecting information (whether repetitive or single time) may be used without first obtaining clearance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Contractors and COTRs should be guided by the provisions of 5 CFR Part 1320, Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public, and seek the advice of the HHS operating division or Office of the Secretary Reports Clearance Officer to determine the procedures for acquiring OMB clearance. The Contractor shall not expend any funds or begin any data collection until OMB Clearance is received. Once OMB Clearance is received from the COTR, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with written notification authorizing the expenditure of funds and the collection of data. The Contractor must allow at least 120 days for OMB clearance. Excessive delays caused by the Government which arise out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor will be considered in accordance with the Excusable Delays or Default clause of this contract.

(End of Clause) H.14 Section 508 Compliance Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility (a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Provisions (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit: 1. Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and 2. Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. (b) Accordingly, any organization submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility provisions. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access- board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm (c) The Section 508 standards applicable to this solicitation will be identified by the Offerors in their proposals. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, Offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://508.hhs.gov. (d) Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products and/or services that are incidental to the project, which may constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If an Offeror claims its products and/or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government ­ i.e., after award of the contract, that products and/or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense.

35

(End of Provision) K.5 FAR 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that ­ (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals ­ (A) Are are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (C) Are are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision. (D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the

48

case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has has not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of Provision)

L.2 HSSAR 352.239-73 Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility (Jan 2010) Electronic Information and Technology Accessibility (a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Provisions (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit: 1. Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and 2. Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. (b) Accordingly, any organization submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility provisions. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access- board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm (c) The Section 508 standards applicable to this solicitation will be identified by the Offerors in their proposals. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, Offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that

52

EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://508.hhs.gov. (d) Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products and/or services that are incidental to the project, which may constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If an Offeror claims its products and/or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government ­ i.e., after award of the contract, that products and/or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense. (e) Prior to the Contracting Officer exercising an option for a subsequent performance period/additional quantity or adding funding for a subsequent performance period under this contract, as applicable, the Contractor must provide a Section 508 Annual Report to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer in writing, the Contractor shall provide the cited report in accordance with the following schedule. Instructions for completing the report are available in the Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability Web site under the heading Vendor Information and Documents. The Contractor's failure to submit a timely and properly completed report may jeopardize the Contracting Officer's exercising an option or adding funding, as applicable.

Volume II of the Offeror's proposal, the business proposal, does not have a page limit; however, it should be carefully prepared to be clear and concise. Volume II ­ Business Proposal shall be organized as follows: TAB 1 TAB 2 TAB 3 TAB 4 TAB 5 TAB 6 TAB 7 Table of Contents Proposal Assumptions Contract Forms, Representations and Certifications Information Other than Cost and Pricing Data Other Administrative Data Responsibility Determination (not applicable to state or local governments) Subcontracting Plan

Volume II ­ Business Proposal TAB 1 ­ Table of Contents: Shall be included that identifies and clearly labels the various business proposal sections. TAB 2 ­ Proposal Assumptions: Offerors shall provide all proposal assumptions used in preparing their proposal submission. Assumptions should include rationale for all pricing. For example, labor rationale sheets should describe how the basis of the hours were determined (e.g. historical data, technical experience, etc.). Assumptions should be separated and identified for the Technical/Management Proposal, Volume I, and the Business Proposal, Volume II. TAB 3 ­ Contract Forms, Representations and Certifications: Signed, dated, and fully executed package consisting of: a) b) c) d) SF-33 cover page, Solicitation, Offer and Award; Section B - Complete price table; Section H - Complete Key Personnel table; Section K ­ Various Representations, Statements, and Certifications must be executed by an official authorized to bind the Offeror. Offerors may complete their Representations and Certifications using the online ORCA web site and include a notice in the proposal that the Offeror has entered its Representations and Certifications in ORCA. See Section K for further instructions to use ORCA.

TAB 4 ­ Information Other than Cost and Pricing Data: The Government reserves the right to request cost or pricing data to establish the reasonableness of the proposed contract and/or subcontract prices after receipt of proposals. Accordingly, if the Government notifies the Offeror that cost or pricing data is required, the Offeror shall prepare and submit cost and pricing data with supporting documentation. Instructions for the preparation of cost or pricing data must be submitted in accordance with instructions specified at FAR 15.403-5 and Table 15.2, FAR 15.408. If applicable, as soon as practicable after negotiating an agreement on price, but before contract award, the Offeror shall submit a Certificate of Current Cost

62

or Pricing Data as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2. Offerors should review FAR clause 52.215-20 for additional information on exceptions. The business proposal is presumed to represent the Offeror's best effort to respond to the solicitation. Any inconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance and price should be explained in the proposal. Any significant inconsistency, if not explained, raises a fundamental issue of the understanding of the nature and scope of the work required and of the Offeror's financial ability to perform the contract and may be grounds for rejection of the offer. The burden of proof for price credibility is with the Offeror. Offeror's are to provide a pricing breakdown of the base year and each option year for each line item stipulated below using TAB 4 as guidance. ITEM 0001 Data Management and Reporting Pricing shall include the following tasks under this line item: ˇ Uniform Receiving, Analyzing, and Reporting of Data ˇ Making Any Data Collected Available to Health Researchers ˇ Transfer of Data and Information ITEM 0002 Member Services Pricing shall include the following tasks under this line item: ˇ Coordinating Outreach Activities ˇ Developing Medical Protocols ITEM 0003 Administrative Services Pricing shall include the following tasks under this line item: ˇ Overall DC Management ˇ Establishing Criteria for the Credentialing of Medical Providers Participating in the Nationwide Network ˇ Coordinating and Administering the Activities of the WTC Health Program Steering Committees ˇ Seeking Input from the CCEs ˇ Engaging in Discussions about Treatment Approaches ˇ Internal Audit Function ˇ Quality Assurance ˇ Records Management ˇ Collaboration with the WTC Health Registry ˇ Consulting with the WTC Program Administrator The itemized pricing for each line item (base year and option years) and rationale for individual categories should be furnished as follows: Direct Labor: Explain the basis for labor hour estimate and include any underlying assumptions. Offerors shall provide labor rates for all labor categories that are expected to be used in the performance of the WTC DC contract. Such labor rates shall be projected for the base year and all option years. Provide a copy of your labor rate agreement, or if you have no such agreement, explain the basis for hourly rate estimates. If direct labor rates are based on a current salary schedule, provide the salary schedule for all proposed labor categories. Also disclose your firm's average experienced annual labor escalation for the past two years. NOTE: see Evaluation of Professional Compensation provision at paragraph L.13 below. The proposed labor rates should be supported with payroll information, letters of intent or salary survey information. Fringe Benefits: Show fringe benefits as a separate cost category. Include the rate(s) and the method of calculating the fringe benefits. Provide a copy of the fringe benefit rate and institutional guidelines. NOTE: see Evaluation of Professional

63

Compensation provision below (L.16) for additional requirements. Subcontracts: All proposed subcontractors shall submit a complete price proposal in the same format as the Offeror's business proposal. Subcontractors may submit price proposal showing the breakdown of costs to CDC under separate sealed package. The Offeror will provide a copy of cost or price analysis performed on proposed subcontractors, as required under FAR 15.404-3. Include these analyses as part of your own cost submissions for subcontracts. (Also, see FAR Subpart 44.2 for information required to support a request for subcontract consent and 52.244-2 ­ Subcontracts, particularly subparagraph (e)(1) ). If offerors propose subcontractors without competition, Offerors shall explain why such requirements were not competed and explain the basis by which the Prime Offeror determined their subcontractor's price "fair and reasonable." Offeror shall also identify the contract type negotiated with its subcontractor(s). Indirect Costs: Indicate how you have computed and applied your indirect costs, including cost breakdowns. (1) Offerors with a current government approved indirect rate agreement should provide provide a copy of your current approved indirect cost rate agreement with the proposal. (2) If you have entered into indirect rate negotiations with the federal government and they have not concluded, furnish a copy of the indirect rate proposal as an attachment to your business proposal. (3) Offerors without current government approved/negotiated indirect rates need to provide the following: The last two years of actual indirect rates with a rate schedule showing both the pool (by cost centers) and base of allocation for each indirect rate and current year-to-date actual incurred rates. Provide budgeted out year rates with sufficient detail to support the basis of estimate for each cost center in the overhead pool. The indirect bases should be in line with anticipated future work. Travel: Provide the cost of travel including destination, duration, purpose, per diem, transportation, and the basis for the proposed costs. All travel shall comply with the Federal Travel Regulations. Other Direct Costs (ODCs): These include materials, equipment, etc. The Offeror shall consolidate ODCs into one line item. However, a separate schedule shall be provided to break down ODCs. The schedule shall provide a detailed itemization of each ODC. The Offeror shall also provide the basis of estimate and rationale for the need for each item of ODC and any underlying assumptions such estimates are predicated upon. Identify calculations that result in the specific cost estimates (e.g. if ODC cost "xyz" = $10,000, identify the calculation of the cost "xyz" such as unit price and quantity etc.). Proposed consulting services must be supported by signed consulting agreements or letters of intent/commitment that clearly denote the agreed to hourly compensation rate. Explain if competitive quotes were sought and if competition not sought, provide explanation for the absence of competition. Escalation: Identify any escalation rates used and the source or basis for the proposed escalation rate(s). If based on historical data, identify and explain how such data is relevant and used to derive the proposed escalation rates.

If additional equipment must be acquired, you must include in your proposal the description and estimated cost of each item and whether you propose to furnish the item with your own funds. (7) Disclosure Statement: If applicable, Offerors shall submit a Disclosure Statement in accordance with FAR Part 30.202.

65

(8) Service Contract Act (if applicable): Offerors should identify those proposed labor categories subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended (FAR 22.10) and provide a crosswalk to the labor category in the applicable Wage Determination for their place of performance. Offerors may obtain Wage Determinations at www.servicecontract.fedworld.gov (click on "selecting SCA WDs" to obtain wage determination). (9) Organization Structure: Offerors should submit an organization structure chart that depicts the relationships between the parent company and its subsidiaries (if applicable). This structure should also include Business Units, Divisions, etc. TAB 6 ­ Responsibility Determination (Not Applicable to State or Local Governments): The Contracting Officer will make a responsibility determination in accordance with FAR Subpart 9.1. The Offeror shall demonstrate the degree to which it has met each area of responsibility. The Offeror shall submit sufficient, current and adequate documentation that demonstrates the Offeror has addressed each area of responsibility below. If no information is available, Offerors shall state non-applicable. CDC will evaluate and assess the documentation and other available information in making a responsibility determination. The responsibility determination is not point-scored; however, it will be used as a factor in making a recommendation for contract award. Contractor's Financial Capability: Your proposal must indicate whether you have the necessary financial capacity, working capital, and other resources to perform the contract without assistance from any outside source (If not, indicate the amount required and the anticipated source). At a minimum, CDC will require that a Contractor has a net worth in excess of 10% of the WTC Operations annual total cost-plus-fee. CDC reserves the right to require a higher level of capitalization/net worth and/or guarantees in a particular case, or to require a higher level of financial capability as a condition for exercise of an option of a contract. Financial Statements: Include a copy of audited financial statements for the past two years. If an audited financial statement is not available, provide the most recent revised, compiled or internally prepared financial statement. Contractors that are newly formed entities will submit the financial statements of the `parent' company (ies). Working Capital: In reviewing the financial statement, CDC may apply standard tests to ensure that the company has adequate working capital to operate the contract(s). Standard Form 1407, which is often used for pre-award surveys, identifies these tests. For instance, the amount of cash and cash-equivalents will be compared to near-term liabilities. Contractor Integrity/Misconduct: CDC will review any and all available information relating to administrative misconduct. Offerors shall disclose any and all known qui tams or other administrative misconduct within the past ten (10) years. Internal Controls: CDC will review any and all available information relating to the Offeror's establishment and operational effectiveness of their internal control system designed to provide reasonable assurance financial, programmatic and compliance objectives. Examples of information that CDC may review as evidence of the design and effectiveness of an Offeror's internal control system include previous Statement on Auditing Standards 70 review results, independent third party reviews of the system, corporate integrity program or other such information as CDC deems appropriate. TAB 7 ­ Subcontracting Plan: This requirement does not apply to small business concerns or to offers which do not exceed $550,000.00. (1) The Offeror, prior to being awarded a contract, must submit an acceptable subcontracting plan (see FAR 52.219-9) or demonstrate that no subcontracting opportunities exist. The small business plan shall cover the

66

entire contract period and shall be submitted for the base year and each option period separately. (Base Year, Option Year 1, etc.) (2) The term "subcontract" means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime Contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for the performance of the original contract or subcontract. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements/purchase orders for supplies and services. (3) The Offeror understands that: a. No contract will be awarded unless and until an acceptable plan is negotiated with the Contracting Officer which plan will be incorporated into the contract, as a material part thereof. An acceptable plan must, in the determination of the Contracting Officer, provide the maximum practicable opportunity for Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Women-Owned Small businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses to participate in the performance of the contract. If a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer is not negotiated within the time limits prescribed by the contracting activity and such failure arises out of causes within the control and with the fault or negligence of the offeror, the offeror shall be ineligible for an award. The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the reasons for determining a subcontracting plan unacceptable early enough in the negotiation process to allow the Contractor to modify the plan within the time limits prescribed. Prior compliance of the Offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous Federal contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in evaluating the reasonableness and realism of the Offeror's plan and probability for achieving the plans objectives. Accordingly, Offerors are invited to submit goals versus actual results achieved for plans related to similar service requirements under other contracts. Identify the contract number, contracting officer name and contact information (phone number, email address), and provide copies of the annual Summary Subcontracting Reports as reported on eSRS or applicable forms if not filed on eSRS. It is the Offeror's responsibility to develop a satisfactory subcontracting plan with respect to Small Business Concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns, Women-Owned Small Business Concerns, HUBZone Small Business Concerns, Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns and that each such aspect of the offeror's plan will be judged independent of the other. The Offeror will submit, as required by the Contracting Officer, subcontracting reports in accordance with the instructions thereon, and as further directed by the Contracting Officer. Subcontractors will also submit these reports to the Government's Contracting Officer or as otherwise directed, with a copy to the prime Contractor's designated small and disadvantaged business liaison.

Plan Contents: Complete and submit the Small Business Subcontracting Plan provided in Attachment J-4. L.16 FAR 52.222-46 Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees (Feb 1993) (a) Recompetition of service contracts may in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished professional employees. This lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract performance. It is therefore in the Government's best interest that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR 541, be properly and fairly compensated. As part of the business proposal price submission requested under TAB 4, include your total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits proposed for the professional employees who will work under the contract. The Government will evaluate the plan to assure that it reflects a sound management approach and understanding of the contract requirements. This evaluation will include an assessment of the offeror's ability to provide uninterrupted high-

67

quality work. The professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact upon recruiting and retention, its realism, and its consistency with a total plan for compensation. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total compensation structure. (b) The compensation levels proposed should reflect a clear understanding of work to be performed and should indicate the capability of the proposed compensation structure to obtain and keep suitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives. The salary rates or ranges must take into account differences in skills, the complexity of various disciplines, and professional job difficulty. Additionally, proposals envisioning compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated on the basis of maintaining program continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and availability of required competent professional service employees. Offerors are cautioned that lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement. (c) The Government is concerned with the quality and stability of the work force to be employed on this contract. Professional compensation that is unrealistically low, or not in reasonable relationship to the various job categories, may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend the complexity of the contract requirements since it may impair the Contractor's ability to attract and retain competent professional service employees, (d) Failure to comply with these provisions may constitute sufficient cause to justify rejection of a proposal. (End of Provision) L.17 Incurring Costs This solicitation does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal. In addition, the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with the proposed acquisition. (End of Provision) L. 18 Instructions to Contractor ­ Central Contractor Registration (CCR) In accordance with FAR 52.204-7, the Contractor shall acknowledge the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any award resulting from this solicitation. FAILURE TO REGISTER IN CCR WILL PROHIBIT CDC FROM MAKING AN AWARD TO YOUR ORGANIZATION. The prospective awardee must enter all mandatory data fields, including the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number or DUNS + 4 number into the CCR database. (See FAR: 52.204-6 Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number). The prospective awardee must also enter all Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) data into the CCR database and is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database. At a minimum, the prospective awardee must review and update the CCR database. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

Section M - Evaluation Factors For Award
FAR SOURCE 52.217-5 M.1 Basis of Award Award will be made to the responsible Offeror submitting the proposal determined to be the most advantageous and the best value to the Government as evaluated under the criteria described in this section. The Government will make this determination by comparing differences in the value of non-cost factors (Technical/Management and Past/Present Performance) with Price. The Government may select for award the Offeror whose price is not the lowest, but whose Technical and Past/Present Performance ratings are sufficiently more advantageous to justify the payment of a higher price. Conversely, the Government may select for award the Offeror whose price is lower, when the other Offeror's Technical and Past/Present Performance ratings are not sufficiently more advantageous to justify the payment of a higher price. The Government reserves the right to make an award for any Line Item proposed, for a quantity less than the quantity offered, or less than the unit cost or prices offered, unless the Offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal. M.2 Discussions and Final Proposal Revisions The Government reserves the right and intends to award without discussions. Each Offeror should submit its best proposal as the opportunity to submit a revised proposal is not anticipated. If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, these discussions will be held with only those Offerors determined by the Contracting Officer to be in the competitive range. The Contracting Officer may determine that the number of most highly rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted and limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. M.3 Rejection of Unrealistic Offerors The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program. M.4 Evaluation Factors M.4.1 General Considerations The Government will assess all responsive proposals against the solicitation requirements and criteria defined by the evaluation factors and subfactors below. In addition to the evaluation of the specific factors identified below, the Government will consider compliance with the solicitation terms and conditions. M.4.2 Specific Criteria ­ Evaluation Factors and Subfactors The Government will use the three (3) factors listed below to make a "best value" determination using the trade-off process. The Technical/Management factor is more important than Past/Present Performance. Past/Present Performance is equal in importance with Price. All evaluation factors other than Price, when combined, are more important than Price. TITLE AND DATE Evaluation of Options (Oct 2004)

Page 69 of 74

FACTOR 1. Technical/Management: The Technical/Management factor will be evaluated based on each subfactor listed in the chart with specific elements to be considered provided below. The number adjacent to each subfactor in the table below indicates the relative importance to the other subfactors. The process is further described in paragraph M.5 below.

Subfactor A B C D

Subfactor Description Understanding of the Requirements Technical and Management Approach Relevant Experience Personnel Total:

Subfactor Relative Weight .10 .40 .30 .20 1.00

Subfactor A ­ Understanding of the Requirements This subfactor is met when the Offeror demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the overall World Trade Center Health Program (WTC Health Program) and specifically the roles and responsibilities the Data Center (DC) will have under this contract. The Performance Work Statement (PWS) should serve as the basis for this response. Subfactor B ­ Technical and Management Approach Evaluation of this subfactor will focus on the Offeror's technical and management capabilities and standard practices for satisfying the overall program and contract objectives of the PWS. The information in Volume I of the Offeror's proposal that demonstrates application of these technical and management processes or plans will be used during the assessment. Evaluation of this subfactor will be based on the Offeror's ability to effectively and successfully implement and manage a WTC Health Program Data Center with an acceptable level of risk. The following elements will be considered in arriving at a rating, but will not be separately rated: Technical Elements             Uniform Receiving, Analyzing, and Reporting of Data Developing Medical Protocols Coordinating Outreach Activities Establishing Criteria for the Credentialing of Medical Providers Participating in the Nationwide Network Coordinating and Administering the Activities of the WTC Health Program Steering Committees Seeking Input from the CCEs Engaging in Discussions about Treatment Approaches Making Any Data Collected Available to Health Researchers Internal Audit Function Quality Assurance Records Management Transfer of Data and Information Collaboration with the WTC Health Registry



Management Elements   The Offeror provides a thorough description of the management structure and division of responsibility that demonstrates the ability to effectively control the full range of management services The Offeror demonstrates the ability to effectively utilize its workforce to accomplish the entire scope of the effort in accordance with the PWS

Page 70 of 74

   

The Offeror's approach is flexible to allow assignment of personnel as well as the rapid reassignment of personnel to satisfy multiple evolving tasks The Offeror demonstrates the ability to provide a comprehensive approach to monitoring and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of contract performance in order to identify areas for improvement The Offeror demonstrates the ability to effectively provide a training and education program which will ensure Data Center performance levels are maintained The Offeror demonstrates the ability to effectively measure and evaluate its execution of the PWS; to plan, track and forecast success in its mission, and in anticipation of contractor's future work needs as outlined in the PWS. The Offeror's plan must clearly define the types and nature of the metrics to be used, the nature of the inferential data to be collected and processed, and the plan for utilizing these for continual process improvement. The Offeror provides an effective Fraud and Abuse Compliance Plan The Offeror provides an effective Quality Assurance Plan

 

Subfactor C ­ Relevant Experience Evaluation of this subfactor will focus on the Offeror's demonstrated relevant experience and its ability to satisfy the overall program and contract objectives of the PWS. The information in Volume I will be used during the assessment. This subfactor is met when the Offeror demonstrates that the relevant experience gained on current or past projects of similar or larger size and scope enables the Offeror to accomplish the requirements of the PWS with an acceptable level of risk. Subfactor D ­ Personnel Evaluation of this subfactor will focus on the Offeror's personnel assigned to this project for satisfying the overall program and contract objectives of the PWS. The information in Volume I will be used during the assessment. This subfactor is met when the Offeror demonstrates the ability to have personnel assigned to this project that have the experience, educational background, and record of past accomplishment appropriate to the scope of the effort.

FACTOR 2. Past/Present Performance: The Past/Present Performance factor will be evaluated based on a performance risk assessment confidence rating. Performance confidence represents the Government's confidence in the Offeror's ability to successfully perform as proposed and is based on an assessment of the Offeror's present and past work record. This process is further described in paragraph M.5 below.

FACTOR 3. Price: Price will be evaluated as described in paragraph M.5 below.

Page 71 of 74

M.5 Evaluation Process FACTOR 1. Technical/Management Step 1. For each subfactor, the Government will identify "Significant Strengths", "Strengths", "Weaknesses", "Significant Weaknesses", "Deficiencies" or "No Identified Ratings" - as applicable - using the definitions from Table 1 below. Step 2. Based upon the results from step 1 above, the Government will then assign an overall "quality" rating and numerical "raw" score from Table 2 that best describes the Government's subjective opinion of the Offeror's Technical/Management proposal for each Subfactor.

Table 1 ADJECTIVAL RATING Significant Strength Strength DEFINITIONS

A quality or characteristic in the proposal that significantly increases the probability of successful contract performance and is of a direct benefit to the Government. A quality or characteristic in the proposal that increases the probability of successful contract performance and is of a direct benefit to the Government.

Weakness

A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance and may impact the program. These are correctable with minimal Government oversight or direction. A flaw in the proposal that significantly increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance and will adversely impact the program. These are correctable with significant Government oversight and direction. A material failure of the proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level. No significant strengths, strengths, weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies identified.

Significant Weakness

Deficiency

No Identified Ratings

Page 72 of 74

Table 2 QUALITY RATING & RAW SCORE Excellent = 4.1 - 5 DEFINITIONS

A comprehensive and thorough proposal that exceeds requirements and clearly demonstrates the Offeror's capability to deliver exceptional performance. Two or more significant strengths are identified with no deficiencies or significant weakness. A proposal having no deficiency and which demonstrates overall competence in meeting the requirements. One or more significant strengths have been found, and strengths clearly offset any weaknesses identified. A proposal having no deficiency and which shows a reasonably sound response to meeting the requirements. There may be strengths or weaknesses, or both. As a whole, any weaknesses not offset by strengths do not significantly detract from the Offeror's response and are correctable with minimal Government oversight or direction. A proposal having no deficiency but has one or more weaknesses and/or significant weakness the combination of which indicate the proposed technical approach would adversely impact the program and require significant Government oversight and direction to correct. Any noted strengths or significant strengths do not sufficiently offset the weaknesses or significant weaknesses. It is doubtful whether the Offeror can meet the requirements. A proposal that is highly inadequate and has one or more deficiencies or significant weaknesses that demonstrate a lack of overall capability and/or understanding of the requirement. The Offeror cannot meet performance requirements and numerous weaknesses exist that are so significant that a proposal rewrite is not feasible within a suitable timeframe.

Very Good = 3.1 - 4

Good = 2.1 - 3

Marginal = 1.1 - 2

Unacceptable = 0 - 1

Step 3. The Government will then derive a weighted score for the Technical/Management factor by multiplying the "raw" score assigned for each subfactor by the relative weight for the subfactor. The example below is provided:

Subfactor A B C D

Subfactor Description Understanding of the Requirements Technical and Management Approach Relevant Experience Personnel Total:

Subfactor Relative Weight .10 .40 .30 .20 1.00

Raw Score 4.6 4.2 2.7 3.3

Weighted Score 0.46 1.68 0.81 0.66 3.61

Offerors should understand that although a numerical score is used, the underlying assignment of the "raw" score is based upon the subjective opinions of the technical panel members using the evaluation criteria cited in the solicitation. Additionally, the Government may consider the weighted scores of each subfactor when considering best value. For example, if two Offerors have similar total weighted scores, the Offeror who has a higher weighted score for subfactor A or B may be considered a better value than an Offeror which received a higher weighted score for subfactor D. Thus, the purpose of weighing the subfactors is to maximize the Government's best value determination among numerous possible weighted scores between competing proposals.

Page 73 of 74

FACTOR 2. Past/Present Performance The Past/Present Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that Offeror's relative record of past performance. In this context, "Offeror" refers to the proposed prime contractor and all proposed major subcontractors. A major subcontractor is defined as one whose subcontract is for more than 30% of the total proposed price. In either case, the prime contractor and proposed major subcontractors will be assessed individually and the results will then be assessed in their totality to derive the Offeror's Past Performance rating. The Government will conduct a Performance Risk assessment using both independent data and data provided by Offerors. Offerors will be evaluated based on the recency, relevancy, and quality of the their past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. Recent performance is defined as contracts performed and/or completed within the past three years. Areas of relevance include projects cited as comparable to the current program in terms of scope, complexity, and/or price. When assessing performance risk, the Government will focus its inquiry on the past/present performance of the Offeror and its proposed major subcontractors as it relates to all solicitation requirements. Step 1. For each "recent" reference received and any independent information obtained, the Government will evaluate the "relevance" of the work. Step 2. For each "recent" reference received and any independent information obtained, the Government will evaluate the "quality" of performance of each offeror's past/preset performance. Step 3. Finally, the Government will consider the combination of "relevance" and "quality" and assign a "confidence" rating from Table 3 below. The confidence rating reflects the Government's opinion of the Offeror's ability to successfully perform the Government's requirement considering both the "relevance" and "quality" of an Offeror's experience for the references received, as well as other sources of information obtained by the Government. The confidence rating is an "overall" past/performance rating; accordingly, Offerors will receive a single confidence rating. (a) A significant achievement, problem, or lack of relevant data in any element of the work can become an important consideration in the source selection process. A negative finding under any element may result in an overall highrisk rating. Therefore, Offerors are reminded to include all relevant past efforts, including demonstrated corrective actions, in their proposal. Relevant performance is defined as contracts that are for efforts that have a logical connection with the efforts required by the solicitation. (b) Offerors are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the Offeror's proposal and data obtained from other sources. Since the Government may not necessarily interview all of the sources provided by the Offerors, it is incumbent upon the Offerors to explain the relevance of the data provided. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proving low performance risk rests with the Offerors. (c) Pursuant to FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), in the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Government will not evaluate the Offeror favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Accordingly, the lack of a relevant performance record will result in an "unknown" performance risk assessment.

FACTOR 3. Price All proposed prices will be considered in the overall price evaluation. The Government will analyze each Offeror's pricing information in terms of completeness, reasonableness, and realism. (1) The Government will evaluate the completeness of each Offeror's business proposal by assessing whether the Offeror provides the required data in sufficient detail to fully support the offer and permit the Government to evaluate the proposal thoroughly. (2) Determination of the reasonableness of the overall price will be made on the basis of adequate price competition and by comparison with the Independent Government Cost Estimate ­ the total valuation shall include consideration of the base year and all option years. (3) The Government may evaluate realism of the proposed prices by assessing whether the proposed prices are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the Offeror's proposal. Unrealistically low prices may indicate a lack of complete understanding of the requirements, a high-risk approach to performance, and/or an inability to attract and maintain a high-quality workforce. The Government will consider the findings of such analysis regarding an Offeror's ability to perform and the risk of its approach. The price evaluation will not be adjusted as a result of any such realism analysis.
