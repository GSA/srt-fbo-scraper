52.212-4    CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAR 2009)

   a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The
      Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may
      require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If
      repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction
      or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights—
         1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
         2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.
      (b) Assignment.  The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract
to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act
(31 U.S.C. 3727).  However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not
assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.
      (c) Changes.  Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties.
      (d) Disputes.  This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 601-613).  Failure of the parties to
this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract
shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference.  The
Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract.
      (e) Definitions.  The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference.
      (f) Excusable delays.  The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable
control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its
sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common
carriers.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any
excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and
shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.
      (g) Invoice.  The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized,) to the address
designated in the contract to receive invoices.  An invoice must include--

      (iii) Contract number, contract line item number and, if applicable, the order number;
      (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of the items delivered;
      (v) Shipping number and date of shipment, including the bill of lading number and weight of shipment if shipped on Government bill of
lading;
      (vi) Terms of any discount for prompt payment offered;
      (vii) Name and address of official to whom payment is to be sent;
      (viii) Name, title, and phone number of person to be notified in event of defective invoice; and
      (ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).  The Contractor shall include its TIN only if required elsewhere in this contract.
      (x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.
      (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information only if required elsewhere in this contract.
      (B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall
have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33,
Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Central Contractor Registration, or 52. 232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other than Central
Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.
      (C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.
      (2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt
payment regulations at 5 CFR 1315.
      (h) Patent indemnity.  The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including
costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark
or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings.
      (i) Payment.  (1) Items accepted.  Payment shall be made for items accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery
destinations set forth in this contract.
      (2) Prompt payment.  The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) prompt pay regulations at 5 CFR 1315.
      (3) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).  If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause.
      (4) Discount.  In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice.  For the
purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the
specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.
        (5) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has
otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall—
(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the—
(A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);
(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;
(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and

(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.
(6) Interest.
(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until

provided in Section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes
due, as provided in (i)(6)(v) of this clause, and then at the rate applicable for each six-month period as fixed by the Secretary until the
amount is paid.
(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.
(iii) Final decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if—
(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt within 30 days;
(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for
payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or
(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see 32.607-2).
(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same
due date as the original demand for payment.
(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:
(A) The date fixed under this contract.
(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.
(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on—
(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;
(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against
the contract debt; or
(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.
(vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition
Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.

      (j) Risk of loss.  Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss or damage to the supplies provided under this
contract shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon:
      (1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or
      (2) Delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.
      (k) Taxes.  The contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and local taxes and duties.
      (l) Termination for the Government's convenience.  The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for
its sole convenience.  In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause
any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work.  Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage
of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor
can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination.  The
Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.  This paragraph does
not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.  The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred
which reasonably could have been avoided.
      (m) Termination for cause.  The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the
Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with
adequate assurances of future performance.  In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any
amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided
by law.  If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination
for convenience.
      (n) Title.  Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon
acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.
      (o) Warranty.  The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular
purpose described in this contract.
      (p) Limitation of liability.  Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for
consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items.
      (q) Other compliances.  The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and
regulations applicable to its performance under this contract.
    (r) Compliance with laws unique to Government contracts. The Contractor agrees to comply with 31 U.S.C. 1352 relating to limitations on the
use of appropriated funds to influence certain Federal contracts; 18 U.S.C. 431 relating to officials not to benefit; 40 U.S.C. 3701, et seq.,
Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act; 41 U.S.C. 51-58, Anti-Kickback Act of 1986; 41 U.S.C. 265 and 10 U.S.C. 2409 relating to
whistleblower protections; Section 1553 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 relating to whistleblower protections for
contracts funded under that Act; 49 U.S.C. 40118, Fly American; and 41 U.S.C. 423 relating to procurement integrity.
        (s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following
order:
      (1) The schedule of supplies/services.
      (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, and Compliance with Laws           Unique to Government Contracts
      paragraphs of this clause.
      (3) The clause at 52.212-5.
      (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software.
      (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation.
      (6) Other paragraphs of this clause.
      (7) The Standard Form 1449.
      (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments.
      (9) The specification.
        (t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
      (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance
on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review
and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is
current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute
for a properly executed contractual document.
      (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and
(C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the
notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
          (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement
at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information
that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the
meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
      (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect
an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the
CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT

      Contractors (instructors) hired for work within the United States or its territories and possessions who require access to Treasury-owned
    or controlled facilities, information systems, security items or products and/or sensitive but unclassified information shall either be U.
    S. citizens or have lawful permanent resident status.  Security screening requirements, however, apply to both U. S. citizens and lawful
    permanent residents hired as Contractors.


    The contractor shall provide personnel that have the capacity to deliver training to a diverse workforce, including a mix of:
         • Executives
         • Supervisory

           evaluations to the COTR within five business days of course completion.


9.0   Course Materials and Supplies
      The contractor shall provide course materials for each session, specific to the course being presented.  The contractor may be requested
    to prepare training at the 8th grade level or below.  The materials shall include certificates of completion, course evaluations,
    videotapes, workbooks, handouts, agendas and other instructional tools.  The Contractor is responsible for presenting these materials to the

    submitted by the participants within 5 days to the COTR. The course evaluation sheets shall be utilized as an indicator of the Contractors
    performance. The BEP understands that in any given course setting a few participants may be critical of the instructor, the course or the
    course material regardless of the general consensus. However, as a general rule an accurate assessment of the course can be ascertained when
    the class scores are taken collectively.  A reasonable expectation for any course is a collective evaluation score between an 85 and a 100.

      The COTR shall provide a list of all participants to the contractor prior to the course start date for preparation and distribution of
    certificates of completion.  Each student shall receive a Certificate of Completion. Certificates and evaluations shall be distributed at

52.212-1    INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JUNE 2008)


      (a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size
standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a
concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in
this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum,
offers must show—
(1) The solicitation number;
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation.
This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
(5) Terms of any express warranty;
(6) Price and any discount terms;
(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address;
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications
that the offeror shall complete electronically);
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
      (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar
items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
      (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and
provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions
of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
      (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified
for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
      (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of
offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the
sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
      (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for
satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
      (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
      (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office
designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is
4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
      (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after
the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting
Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
      (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of
entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
      (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was
under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
      (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be
considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
      (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation
on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.
      (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government
office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment
of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended
to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
      (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response
to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received
at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile
offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers,
the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
      (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without
discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint.
However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government
may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.
      (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government
reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror
specifies otherwise in the offer.

block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “DUNS” or “DUNS+4” followed by the DUNS or DUNS+4 number that
identifies the offeror’s name and address. The DUNS+4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the
offeror to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the
same concern. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the

for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.
      (k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror
acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through
final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time

TECHNICAL PROPOSAL

The Offeror shall address the following technical evaluation factors.
      • Course Materials
      • Instructor Qualifications and Experience


      1.    COURSE MATERIALS


           The Offeror shall provide a copy of all instructional materials to be used to conduct the courses listed.  Instructional materials
           include a training outline, training manuals, handouts, and any other supplemental course materials.  The course material shall

           make sure all materials being used for each course meet all of the requirements of the Performance Work Statement.


           Course materials shall be provided electronically.   If course materials have to be developed, a representative sample of the
           materials to be used may be submitted.


            NOTE:  Proposals that do not include a copy of the course materials will not be evaluated.
      2.    INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS & EXPERIENCE


           The resume(s) of the proposed instructor(s) for each session shall be provided.  In addition to the basic qualifications, the
           resume(s) must include certifications held, knowledge, experience, and effectiveness.  Instructor qualifications will be evaluated to
           ensure the instructor has extensive knowledge, instruction experience, and effectiveness in providing the required training.


PAST PERFORMANCE


      NOTE:  Offerors shall provide current contact information.


      Offerors shall provide names and contact information for at least three (3) references of clients, preferably Government agencies, where
      the instructor has presented same or similar training within the last (3) years.  Information provided shall include agency name, point of
      contact, address, phone number, facsimile number, e-mail address and list of courses provided to the agency and the dates of those courses.
      The Offeror shall ALSO provide the past performance questionnaire to these same identified (3) references.


      Past performance will also be evaluated for its relevance to the requirements of this PWS.


      The Offeror's references shall complete the questionnaire and email it directly to PSB3@bpd.treas.gov, and must state "ATTN: Tina White" in
      the subject line.  Offerors are responsible to ensure that their reference sources receive, complete, and return the questionnaires on
      time. The evaluation may take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant
      experience, or subcontract work where your firm performed major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to
      the instant acquisition. However, the proposal should clearly define who accomplished the work if performed by other than the prospective
      contractor (e.g., a key personnel) and define the role (e.g., prime contractor, subcontractor, subtier subcontractor, etc.) performed by
      the Offeror. The government shall consider the information provided from the Offeror and may well consider any other source when evaluating
      the Offeror’s past performance.


      In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the
      Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

PRICING PROPOSAL


      The Offeror shall provide a firm-fixed price proposal for performing the scope of services identified in the PWS.  The number of
      participants may vary depending on the location of the training.  In Washington, DC, the maximum class size is 18 whereas in Ft. Worth, TX,
      maximum class size is 12.  Each training course shall be priced on a per class, price for the minimum # students and a price for each
      additional student up to the maximum.  Offers that include separate items to be reimbursed on a cost basis may be rejected.  For purposes
      of evaluation only, price proposals will be evaluated based on the price for the maximum number of students.

52.212-2      EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

      (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the
solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate
offers:

      Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  As offerors' rating for non-price factors approach
equivalency, price becomes more important in the award decision.

      (b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the
basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of
options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
      (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for
acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified
expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a
written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2, EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)

Evaluation of Proposals

Technical Evaluation Factors
      Course Material  - Course material will be evaluated to make sure all materials being used for each course meet all of the requirements of
      the Performance Work Statement.


      Instructor Qualifications and Experience - The Government will evaluate the instructor's qualifications to ensure the instructor has the
      knowledge, instructional experience, and effectiveness in providing the required training.

Past Performance
      The Government will evaluate past performance for relevancy based on how well the offeror performed same or similar work.  The Government
      will evaluate course materials, cost and past performance. The Government may also evaluate information that is gathered independently of
      the offeror's submitted information to assess its past contract performance. The absence of any past contract performance will be neither
      favorable or unfavorable.


Price
      The Government will use price analysis techniques to evaluate price to determine that prices are fair and reasonable.  For purposes of
      evaluation only, price proposals will be evaluated based on the price for the maximum number of students.
