This focus is in response to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Pub. L. 111­5) which was enacted in 2009 to improve health care quality, safety, and efficiency through the promotion of Health Information Technology (HIT) and electronic health information exchange. Under HITECH, several AHRQ QIs are included in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) EHR incentive programs thereby necessitating retooling of the AHRQ measures and maintaining these measures in an EHR environment. In October 2014, ICD-10 will be the required coding standard by all programs supported within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). These overlapping requirements have significant impact on the AHRQ QI methodology and maintenance processes which need to be addressed concurrently.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION C.1.1. AHRQ Quality Indicators C.1.1.1 Mission and Vision AHRQ is the federal agency tasked with producing evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible and more affordable, and to work with HHS and other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used. One of the basic foundations for producing evidence on how to improve quality is quality measurement. As 1 of 12 agencies within the DHHS, AHRQ supports research and tools that help people make informed decisions and that improve the quality of health care services. AHRQ, along with other DHHS agencies, participates in the Affordable Care Act's National Quality Strategy (NQS), a nationwide effort to align public and private interests to improve the quality of health and health care for all Americans. NQS is guided by three aims: 1) to provide better and more patient-centered, reliable, accessible and safe care, 2) to improve the health of the US population and 3) to reduce the cost of quality health care for individuals, families, employers and the government (US DHHS, 2013; US DHHS, 2011). One way AHRQ carries out its mission and vision is to provide researchers, data organizations, health care planning administrators, hospital executives, purchasers, insurers, local and state agencies, and federal agencies with the tools to assess the quality of care being provided in hospitals. AHRQ also used data on hospital admissions to provide information about potentially preventable admissions, to help health departments, accountable care organizations (ACOs), Medicaid agencies, and others target primary care and public health efforts. Quality measures, such as the AHRQ QIs, are widely used for research, health care planning, quality improvement, and reporting initiatives throughout the United States (US).

C.1.1.2 History of the AHRQ Quality Indicators In 1994, staff at the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), now called the AHRQ, developed the original Quality Indicators as part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). These original indicators were created in response to requests from State partners who contributed data to HCUP and from researchers seeking to understand health care quality using administrative data. HCUP Partners and researchers sought approaches to make better use of their hospital administrative data, but did not necessarily have the technical expertise and resources to develop measures de novo. In 2000, the Agency embarked upon a process to expand, refine and severity-adjust the HCUP QIs through the Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) at University of California-San Francisco and Stanford University. This effort resulted in the development of the AHRQ QIs, the current state of the art in indicators based on administrative data. Subsequent to the development of the AHRQ QIs under the EPC contract, AHRQ contracted with Stanford University for the Support for Quality Indicators (SQI) contract. Subcontractors on the contract included UC Davis and Battelle Memorial Institute. This was followed by a contract with Battelle Memorial Institute for the Support for Quality Indicators II (SQI-II) contract. Subcontractors on the contract included UC Davis and Stanford University. The purpose of both contracts was to provide a bridge between the developers and the users of the measures. The contracts included provisions for technical support, updating of indicators and modules, development of user friendly tools and documentation etc. The goals of the contract were to help demonstrate and increase the value of the QIs, respond to user needs, and increase the use of measures derived from administrative data in quality improvement and public reporting efforts. This work continued to be supported by Battelle Memorial Institute under the Support for Quality Indicators III (SQI-III) contract. This next phase of the AHRQ QI Maintenance contract will focus solely on maintaining and supporting the use of the AHRQ QIs in health care reform, transitioning the AHRQ QIs to the EHR and ICD-10 environment, and provide necessary technical assistance. Methodological improvements and enhancements requiring analytic and/or substantive expertise will be conducted by AHRQ under separate mechanisms and shared as appropriate and when needed with the AHRQ QI contractor. C.1.1.3 Characteristics and Uses of the Current AHRQ QIs The nature and the uses of the QIs have evolved considerably during the past decades. The original HCUP Quality Indicators were primarily used for quality improvement efforts and were based upon a "common denominator" hospital discharge data set, (i.e. using administrative data elements collected by all or nearly all hospital data systems through the Uniform Bill) (CMS, Medicare Claims Processing Manual, 2013). The current AHRQ QIs take advantage of data enhancements, improvements in coding practices and advanced statistical methodologies where possible,. New data elements for which the evidence suggests inclusion in the measure specifications improves the accuracy and the reliability of the measures, such as Present-onAdmission (POA) and laboratory values, have been incorporated. Furthermore, the original HCUP Quality Indicators, which were used primarily for research and quality improvement,
Page 12 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

were conceived as fairly rudimentary measures that indicated where quality problems may exist simply signaling a need for further investigation. As such, the original HCUP Quality Indicators did not require sophisticated programming knowledge, rigorous precision, or risk adjustment for comparisons across hospital performance. Over time, the AHRQ QIs evolved into metrics used not only for quality improvement but also into metrics for public reporting and pay-forperformance. The current AHRQ QIs are complex measures with sophisticated risk adjustment methodology and applications for missing data. As a result of this evolution, the uses and the users of the AHRQ QIs are much more extensive and diverse than in the early years. The AHRQ QIs now serve multiple purposes, including research, needs assessments for planning at the local, state, and national levels, hospital and community quality improvement initiatives, performance assessment through private and public reporting, public reporting to reward favorable outcomes and encourage changes in hospital behavior, and information to be used by healthcare purchasers that link performance with payment. Users of the AHRQ QIs vary and include researchers, State data organizations, community health organizations, hospitals and hospital systems, hospital associations, State Medicaid agencies, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), large private purchasers and public-private purchaser coalitions, consumer groups, and local, State and Federal health care planning and monitoring organizations. State hospital associations, state data associations, hospitals and hospital systems use AHRQ QIs to help them understand how their hospital(s) compares on various quality dimensions in relationship to other hospitals, the state, or national average. Many of these organizations use the AHRQ QIs in hospital-level reporting programs. Researchers, quality improvement officers, hospital administrators and community health planners use AHRQ QIs to ask questions that provide initial feedback about clinical areas appropriate for further, more in-depth analysis, such as: What can the pediatric AHRQ Prevention QIs tell me about the adequacy of pediatric primary care in my community? How does the hysterectomy rate in our area compare with the national average? State hospital associations can use the AHRQ QIs to do quick screens of hospital quality and primary care access. Hospitals and hospital systems nationwide can use the AHRQ QIs in quality improvement initiatives where the QIs are used to identify a potential quality problem, interventions are put in place and the QIs are used to determine whether the intervention had an impact. Managed care organizations, business-health coalitions, and others are poised to begin assessments using hospital discharge data to answer questions such as: Can we design community interventions to reduce hospital admission rates in areas with high rates of diabetes complications? Which AHRQ QIs can be incorporated into performance management initiatives for our member hospitals? Federal and State policymakers use the AHRQ QIs to track health care quality in the United States over time and to assess whether health care quality is improving, for example: How does the rate of coronary artery bypass graft procedures vary over time and across regions of the United States? Another such example is the use of the AHRQ QIs to track national health care

quality and disparities in the Congressionally-mandated National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports. In addition to the examples above, the AHRQ QIs are currently being used in hospital-level public reporting programs in 32 states affecting more than three-fourths of the US population. The AHRQ QIs are included in My Own Network powered by AHRQ (MONAHRQŽ) and on the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)' Hospital Compare website in 2011; have been included in the methodology used for U.S. News and World Reports ranking of the top 100 hospitals in the US; are part of the Leapfrog Safety Score, and Partnership for Patients; and are used by numerous hospitals and hospital systems in their quality improvement programs. The AHRQ QIs are supportive of several initiatives called for under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) Public Law 111-148, including activities related to Section 3001, Section 3008, and Section 10303.

C.1.1.4. Overview of the AHRQ QI Modules C.1.1.4.1. General Overview The AHRQ QIs currently consist of four modules of indicators of the quality of care. The AHRQ QI modules are: Prevention Quality Indictors (PQIs) or ambulatory care sensitive conditions that identify adult hospital admissions that evidence suggests could have been avoided, at least in part, through high-quality outpatient care. Initially released in November of 2000, there are currently 17 PQIs, including 14 area-level indicators and 3 composite indicators. The PQIs are population based and adjusted for gender and age. Even though these indicators are based on hospital inpatient data, they provide insight into the community health care system or services outside the hospital setting. For example, patients with diabetes may be hospitalized for diabetic complications if their conditions are not adequately monitored or if they do not receive the patient education needed for appropriate selfmanagement. The PQIs can be used as a "screening tool" to help flag potential health care quality problem areas that need further investigation; provide a quick check on primary care access or outpatient services in a community by using patient data found in a typical hospital discharge abstract; and, help public health agencies, State data organizations, health care systems, and others interested in improving health care quality in their communities. With high-quality, community-based primary care, hospitalization for these illnesses often can be avoided. Although other factors outside the direct control of the health care system, such as poor environmental conditions or lack of patient adherence to treatment recommendations, can result in hospitalization, the PQIs provide a good starting point for assessing quality of health services in the community. Because the PQIs are calculated using readily available hospital administrative data, they are an easy-to-use and inexpensive screening tool. They can be used to provide a window into the community -- to identify unmet community health care needs, to
Page 14 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

monitor how well complications from a number of common conditions are being avoided in the outpatient setting, and to compare performance of local health care systems across communities. Inpatient Quality Indicators (IQIs) reflect quality of care for adults inside hospitals and include: Inpatient mortality for medical conditions; inpatient mortality for surgical procedures; utilization of procedures for which there are questions of overuse, underuse, or misuse; and volume of procedures for which there is evidence that a higher volume of procedures maybe associated with lower mortality. Initially released in May of 2002, there are currently 34 IQIs, including 6 volume indicators at the provider-level, 15 risk-adjusted provider-level indicators, 7 provider-level indicators that are not risk-adjusted, 4 area-level indicators, and 2 composite indicators. Risk adjustment of the current IQIs include: patient demographics, the 3M APRDRGs, MDC, transfer status, point-of-origin, and procedure days, when available. Additionally, 5 of the indicators include risk stratification. The IQIs can be used to help hospitals identify potential problem areas that might need further study; provide the opportunity to assess quality of care inside the hospital using administrative data found in the typical discharge record; include mortality indicators for conditions or procedures for which mortality can vary from hospital to hospital; include utilization indicators for procedures for which utilization varies across hospitals or geographic areas; and, include volume indicators for procedures for which outcomes may be related to the volume of those procedures performed. Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) also reflect quality of care for adults inside hospitals, but focus on potentially avoidable complications and iatrogenic events. Initially released in March of 2003, there are currently 26 PSIs, including 12 risk-adjusted provider-level indicators, 6 provider-level indicators that are not risk-adjusted, 7 area-level indicators and 1 composite indicator. Risk adjustment of the current PSIs include: age, modified-DRG, MDC, comorbidities, transfer status, point-of-origin, and procedure days, if available. In addition, one of the indicators contains specifications for risk stratification. These indicators are some of the most frequently used indicators in quality improvement and public reporting initiatives. The PSIs can be used to help hospitals identify potential adverse events that might need further study; provide the opportunity to assess the incidence of adverse events and in hospital complications using administrative data found in the typical discharge record; include indicators for complications occurring in hospitals that may represent patient safety events; and, indicators also have area level analogs designed to detect patient safety events on a regional level. Pediatric Quality Indicators (PDIs) both reflect quality of care for children below the age of 18 and neonates inside hospitals and identify potentially avoidable hospitalizations among children. The PDIs focus on potentially preventable complications and iatrogenic events for pediatric patients treated in hospitals, and on preventable hospitalizations among pediatric patients (i.e., a combination of IQIs, PSIs and PQIs for the pediatric population). Initially released in April of 2006, there are currently 21 PDIs, including 9 risk-adjusted provider-level indicators, 3 providerlevel indicators that are not risk adjusted, 5 area-level indicators, and 4 composite indicators. Risk adjustment models for the current PDIs may include: age, gender, birth weight, Modified DRG, MDC, Clinical Classification Software groupings of conditions, transfer status, point of origin and procedure days. In addition, some of the indicators have risk-stratified categories.

Page 15 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

The PDIs apply to the special characteristics of the pediatric population; screen for problems that pediatric patients experience as a result of exposure to the healthcare system and that may be amenable to prevention by changes at the provider level or area level; and, help to evaluate preventive care for children in an outpatient setting, and most children are rarely hospitalized. The AHRQ QIs rely on data elements and standard coding practices found within billing or claims data, as provided on the Uniform Bill (UB-04) (http://www.nubc.org/). The National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics provides guidance on the standard coding of diagnoses and procedures (e.g., http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.htm and http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd10.htm ), Present-on-Admission indication of conditions and external cause of injury, patient demographics (gender, race/ethnicity), expected payer, admission status and point-of-origin, and discharge disposition. All of the technical specifications and methodology used to develop the AHRQ QIs can be found on the AHRQ QI website: www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov ` C.1.1.4.2 Methodology Overview The current empirical methods of the AHRQ QIs are described in a comprehensive AHRQ QI report entitled, Quality Indicator Empirical Methods, posted on the AHRQ QI website (www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov). An indicator may describe results at the provider or hospital-level or at an area or populationlevel. Some indicators indicate the number of times a medical procedure was performed within a facility (volume indicators). Most indicators, however, are expressed as ratios with a numerator of counts of hospitalizations with a condition or outcome of interest (e.g., mortality) and a denominator of the population at risk (e.g., discharges or census population estimates). The AHRQ QI software calculates several rates, including the observed rate in the population of interest, the expected rate based on the reference (nearly universal) population, the riskadjusted rate that accounts for the mix of patients in the hospital, and the smoothed rate (or performance score) that accounts for some of the noise in the data. The risk adjustment of the AHRQ QI modules varies by the type of indicator. Provider-level indicators are risk-adjusted by deriving a hierarchical logic regression model that uses a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach to account for clustering at the provider level. When GEE models do not converge, a multivariable logistic regression model that does not account for correlation is employed. Area-level indicators are risk adjusted for age and gender, and optionally for poverty. Smoothed rates (or performance scores) are the weighted average of the risk-adjusted rates and the reference population rates (or a regression determined target estimate based on provider attributes such as volume or prior performance). The smoothed rate is derived using empirical Bayes shrinkage to result in a rate that minimizes noise from the estimates. The shrinkage estimator is based on signal and noise variance estimates. When there is a fixed comparative rate

of interest, it is possible to parameterize the smoothed rates posterior probability distribution to assign performance categories for public reporting. Additionally, the AHRQ QI modules have several composite indicators that combine the results of several indicators. The AHRQ IQI composites are derived from the weighted average of the observed-to-expected ratios for a set of component AHRQ IQIs. The weights include component weights and shrinkage weights. The component weights are denominator weights, defined as the relative frequency of the denominators for the component indicators in the reference population. The shrinkage weights are the signal-to-noise ratio, where the signal variance is estimated from the reference population, and the noise variance is estimated from the user's data and is unique to each provider's user's data. The AHRQ PSI and a PDI composite is derived from the weighted average of the observed-to-expected ratios for a set of AHRQ PSIs. The weights include component weights and shrinkage weights. The component weights are numerator weights, defined as the relative frequency of the numerators for the component indicators in the reference population. The shrinkage weights are the signal-to-noise ratio, where the signal variance is estimated from the reference population, and the noise variance is estimated form the user's data and is unique to each provider in the user's data. The AHRQ PQI composites are expressed as rates based on a numerator of the aggregate count of hospitalizations for each component indicator and a denominator of the population at risk (e.g., census population estimates). C.1.1.5. Description of AHRQ QI Documentation Documentation is a cornerstone feature of the AHRQ QI program, as it serves as the primary resource for the AHRQ QI algorithms and how the AHRQ QIs were created. Documentation includes the technical specifications of each of the AHRQ QIs, technical reports that support the AHRQ QIs, software manuals, detailed descriptions of the AHRQ QI measures including numerators, denominators, reliability and validity estimates, and interpretation of rates, reports that describe how and why measures were developed, benchmarks of AHRQ QI rates/ratios, and lists of publications that use the AHRQ QIs. Ideally, documentation is created and updated in tandem with the creation of each version of the AHRQ QIs and as necessary to correct documentation errors noted by users. C.1.1.6. Description of AHRQ QI Software The AHRQ QI program is unique in that it provides publicly available software tools that calculate the AHRQ QI rates. This software legally resides in the public domain and is available as a free download from the AHRQ QI website. It allows users to calculate QI measure results based on their own administrative data set using a standard desktop computer. The AHRQ QI software tools are a key part of AHRQ's QI program. They help to support AHRQ's objective to disseminate standardized, transparent quality measures; to ensure that the measures are calculated in a consistent and accurate manner; and to remove barriers to their use. The AHRQ QI software allows users to calculate QI rates based on their own administrative data using a standard desktop computer. Each version of the QIs is released with software in two different platforms: a SASŽ application and a Windows application. The SAS software was first released in the late 1990s. It consists of several modules of SAS code and requires a SAS
Page 17 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

license to run (http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/software/SAS.aspx) . The Windows-based software, known as WinQI, was first released in 2005 (http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/software/winQI.aspx ). It was created in order to provi e an easy-to-use, low-cost option for calculating the QIs that was not dependent on licensed software. Developed on MicrosoftŽ Visual Studio using C# and .NET, AHRQ WinQI runs on Windows operating systems and requires only freely available software components: AHRQ-produced software, Microsoft .NET (for runtime environment and core software libraries), and Microsoft SQL Server Express (for data storage and manipulation). Table 1 lists the differences between SAS QI v4.5 and WinQI v4.5. Both the SAS and WinQI software are available in Version 4.5 as either 32-bit or 64-bit applications. The 32-bit applications are targeted for Windows XP operating systems, and the 64-bit applications are targeted for Windows 7 operating systems. Both versions of the QI software are updated on an annual basis to reflect changes in the AHRQ QI technical specifications. New software versions and updated technical specifications are released simultaneously. Routine annual updates include yearly International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), Medicare severity-Diagnostic Related Groups (MS-DRG), Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC), updated version of the 3MTM APR-DRG grouper, new Census population files, newly derived risk adjustment parameters, and an updated prediction module to account for missing POA data associated with covariates (see Sections C.6). As the AHRQ QIs have matured and their use has grown, the AHRQ QI software tools have needed to transition from small research prototypes to widely used, production quality software. This growth in volume, visibility, and use has brought a significant need for software sophistication and support. AHRQ's priorities regarding the software tools include:  ensuring that they remain an accessible, low cost, and user friendly way to use the AHRQ QIs  updating and expanding the tools to keep pace with changes in the QIs  supporting software users with well-organized, accurate documentation and responsive technical assistance  employing good software development and testing practices that ensure timely, accurate, and robust software products C.1.1.7. Description of AHRQ QI Web Site The AHRQ QI Web site (http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov) is the main vehicle through which information on the AHRQ QIs is disseminated. The web site provides detailed information on each of the QI modules, the specifications and methodology for the measures, as well as the SAS and windows-based software which calculates the QI rates. Specifically, the AHRQ QI website should serve as a central repository for all project information including:    General information about the project Technical specifications for each AHRQ QI Software instruction manuals

C.1.2. National Initiatives associated with the AHRQ Quality Indicators C.1.2.1. National Quality Forum (NQF) Endorsement The National Quality Forum (NQF) is a private, not-for-profit membership organization with more than 375 members representing multiple sectors of the healthcare system. NQF operates under a three-part mission to improve the quality of American healthcare by:  Setting national priorities and goals for performance improvement.
 Endorsing national consensus standards for measuring and publicly reporting on

performance.
 Promoting the attainment of national goals through education and outreach programs.

NQF is a voluntary consensus standards setting body as specified by the National Technology and Transfer Advancement Act of 1995 and OMB Circular A-119 (1998). NQF endorsement, which involves rigorous, evidence-based review and a formal Consensus Development Process, has become the "gold standard" for healthcare performance measures. Major healthcare purchasers, including CMS, rely on NQF-endorsed measures to ensure that the measures are scientifically sound and meaningful and to help standardize performance measures used across the industry. To date, NQF has endorsed more than 600 measures; among them are over 40 AHRQ QIs. In 2007, AHRQ submitted a set of AHRQ QIs to the National Quality Forum (NQF) for endorsement under their consensus development process. That effort resulted in the successful endorsement of 47 AHRQ QIs for public reporting: 15 IQIs, 9 PSIs, 11 PDIs, 12 PQIs (Appendix 1:NQF Endorsed Individual and Composite Measures). This facilitated an increase in the use of the AHRQ QIs for hospital-level public reporting by CMS and many states. Currently, there are 32 states which publicly report some or all of the AHRQ QIs (see Appendix 2 and Appendix 3).

C.1.2.2. THE HEALTHCARE COST AND UTILIZATION PROJECT (HCUP) The AHRQ QIs measures and tools are annually updated and tested using data from HCUP (www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov). HCUP (pronounced "H-Cup") is a family of health care databases and related software tools, products, and services developed through a Federal-State-Industry partnership and sponsored by AHRQ. HCUP brings together the data collection efforts of State data organizations, hospital associations, private data organizations, and the Federal government to create a national health care information resource of patient-level health care data (HCUP Partners, http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/partners.jsp?SID). HCUP includes the largest collection of longitudinal hospital care data in the United States, with all-payer, encounter level information beginning in 1988. These databases enable research on a broad range of health policy issues, including cost and quality of health services, medical practice patterns, access to health care programs and outcomes of treatments at the national State and local market levels. The core of HCUP is a unique data source that provides record-level data on health care utilization for a range of settings including acute inpatient, emergency department, and ambulatory surgery. The information provided in HCUP spans patient demographics, ICD-9CM diagnoses and procedures and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System/Current Procedural Terminology (HCPCS/CPT) procedures, how the patient was admitted and discharged, and resource utilization. Beginning with the 2014 data, diagnoses and procedures will be coded with ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-Procedure Coding System. HCUP is unique because it collects all records in all settings from those data sources that participate. It is also unique because of the derivative databases that can be used to generate national estimates. The HCUP databases are available for intramural research within AHRQ. Restricted access public release versions of many of the HCUP databases are available to the public through the AHRQ-sponsored HCUP Central Distributor. The content of the restricted access public release versions of the HCUP databases is developed in partnership with the participating data organizations. Because the participating data organizations dictate the release of specific data elements, the data elements on the restricted access public release databases are a subset of the data elements in the intramural databases. The HCUP databases are available to users who sign a Data Use Agreement (DUA). This agreement allows the data to be used for research and aggregate statistical reporting, but prohibits the identification of individual hospitals in disseminated materials. The HCUP family of health services databases includes:  HCUP state databases ­ state-specific annual inpatient and outpatient data files including the State Inpatient Databases (SID), State Ambulatory Surgery Databases (SASD) and State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD) HCUP nationwide databases ­ nationwide samples derived from the HCUP state databases enabling focused research on special populations including the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) and the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS)



Page 21 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV



Other HCUP-related databases and tools ­ supplementary databases and tools that are used to augment information in the HCUP state and nationwide databases including the Clinical Classification Software (CCS) for ICD-9-CM, Comorbidity Software (http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tools_software.jsp)

There are currently 47 organizations within the HCUP Partnership, all of whom have given permission for the AHRQ QI program to use their data for development of AHRQ QIs and AHRQ QI software. To date, AHRQ QIs have been developed using the HCUP SID, NIS and KID, although future AHRQ QI modules may rely on the SEDD, NEDS, and SASD. Additional information about HCUP can be found at http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov. C.1.2.3. NATIONAL QUALITY MEASURES CLEARINGHOUSE (NQMC) NQMC, an AHRQ-supported initiative for DHHS, is a database and Web site for information on specific evidence-based health care quality measures and measure sets. NQMC seeks to provide practitioners, health care providers, health plans, integrated delivery systems, purchasers and others an accessible mechanism for obtaining detailed information on quality measures, and to further their dissemination, implementation, and use in order to inform health care decision and promote widespread access to quality measures by the health care community and other interested individuals. NQMC has been available as a public resource since February 2003. The AHRQ QIs are included in the NQMC. More information on the NQMC can be found at: http://www.qualitymeasures.ahrq.gov/index.aspx. C.1.2.4. NATIONAL HEALTHCARE QUALITY AND DISPARITIES REPORTS Every year since 2003, AHRQ has worked collaboratively with DHHS agencies and reported to the US Congress on the progress and opportunities for improving health care quality and reducing health care disparities. As mandated by the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-129), the National Healthcare Quality Report (NHQR) focuses on "national trends in the quality of health care provided to the American people" (42 USC 299b2(b)(2)). The National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHDR) focuses on "prevailing disparities in health care delivery as it relates to racial factors and socioeconomic factors in priority populations" (42 USC 299a-1(a)(6)). The NHQR and NHDR include a broad set of performance measures including most of the AHRQ QIs. While initially intended for legislative policy makers, the reports have grown in scope and importance to a variety of national and international audiences (IOM, 2010). More information on the NHQR and NHDR can be found at: http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/index.html C.1.2.5. MY OWN NETWORK, POWERED BY AHRQ (MONAHRQ) MONAHRQ is a desktop software tool created by AHRQ that enables organizations ­ such as state and local data organizations, regional reporting collaboratives, hospitals and hospital systems, and health plans ­ to quickly and easily generate a health care reporting Website. MONAHRQ analyzes, summarizes, and presents information in a format ready for use by consumers and other decision makers on: quality of care at the hospital level, health care utilization at the hospital level, preventable hospitalizations at the area level, rates of conditions and procedures at the area level and estimated costs and cost-savings related to quality of care. Users of MONAHRQ currently have the option of including all of the AHRQ IQIs, PSIs and

Page 22 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

PQIs. Future versions of MONAHRQ will include the PDIs. The MONAHRQ project maintains its own website and documentation at www.monahrq.ahrq.gov . C.1.2.6. CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) INITIATIVES CMS is historically the federal agency tasked with overseeing Medicare, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs (CHIP), but more recently through the ACA has been tasked with expanding access to affordable health care and making the US health care system more outcome-drive and cost-effective (e.g., ACA Section 3001, Section 3008, HR 3590 Title X, Subtitle C and provision related to Title III). CMS has used AHRQ QIs in their quality reporting programs, including the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program (IQR) and Hospital Compare. More recently, with additional mandates to coordinate with States to set up Health Insurance Marketplaces, expand Medicaid, and regulate private health insurance plans, CMS has considered the use of AHRQ QIs in other CMS programs including but not limited to Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS), reporting by ACOs, Partnership for Patients, CMS program supporting the National Quality Strategy, programs related to the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CIIO), and initiatives in the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI). C.1.3. CURRENT USER DEMAND In recent years, the utilization of the AHRQ QIs has increased significantly. Approximately 200 user inquiries are received each month. There are currently 2,400 subscribers to the listserv, approximately 15,000 visits to the website monthly, and between 65,000 to 85,000 file downloads of QI documentation and software monthly. As mentioned earlier, this rapid uptake of the QIs has been due to many factors including a demand for transparent, standardized measures using readily available data, for both quality improvement and comparative reporting as well an increased focus on public reporting and pay for performance.

C.2. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The goal of the AHRQ Quality Indicators 2014-2019 contract is to annually produce a set of AHRQ QIs that can be used to measure quality in support of research, public health planning, quality improvement initiatives and Federal, national and local public reporting programs. The objectives of this contract are to: 1) maintain scientific integrity of technical specifications and software for use in health care reform; 2) transition of the AHRQ QIs to an ICD-10 and EHR environment, and 3) provide customer-oriented technical assistance to users of the AHRQ QIs.

C.6. COORDINATE THE MAINTENANCE, TESTING, AND RELEASE OF ALL AHRQ QI MODULES The AHRQ QI Initiative can be broadly divided into 2 categories: development and maintenance. This statement of work focuses on the latter. Maintenance activities are primarily those tasks which update the software and documentation based on coding updates, new data elements and/or implementation of select user-suggested improvements. Changes to AHRQ QI methodology (both clinical and statistical) are not part of this requirement. Such changes shall be provided by AHRQ for implementation during the regular maintenance cycle. C.6.1. COORDINATION AND PLANNING FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND TESTING OF ALL AHRQ QI MODULES The maintenance and testing of the AHRQ QI modules are keys to the success of this project. The Contractor shall develop and carry out a coordinated plan for the maintenance and testing of the modules. The Contractor shall provide a dedicated team member to be accountable for the coordinated maintenance and testing of all of the AHRQ QI modules. The Contractor shall assume a 12-month maintenance cycle. The Contractor shall communicate about coordination activities so that the AHRQ COR is kept abreast of various issues that arise during the course of the project. C.6.2. CENSUS DATA OR OTHER POPULATION-BASED ESTIMATES DATA The AHRQ QI area level measures use the population of the county of the patient's residence as the denominator. The population counts are provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates program. In the past, the data required manipulation to be able to have appropriate area level estimates. There is typically a two year lag in the population estimates. AHRQ will provide data for population-based estimates. C.6.3. CREATE REFERENCE POPULATION FILES FROM HCUP DATA The annual creation of the reference population files serve to produce the expected rates to reflect a given time period of the data. For instance, the reference population file that appears in version 4.5 of the AHRQ QIs are based on 2010 HCUP data from 44 HCUP-participating states. The Contractor shall be prepared to annually update such a reference population should AHRQ pursue this route in version 4.6 and future versions. The Contractor shall work with AHRQ to determine the earliest possible time at which the reference population data may be available, coordinating with the COR during the first quarter of the fiscal year. The data set used for the work related to the current four AHRQ QI modules is the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) State Inpatient Data (SID). Currently, the SID represents 47 States of all-payer inpatient data sets, which represents approximately 97% of admissions in the US. Note that there are AHRQ QI modules under development that use other HCUP data sets, such as the AHRQ emergency department community-level indicators which will use HCUP State Emergency Department Databases and/or Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. It is necessary for the Contractor to have adequate knowledge, experience, hardware, and software technology to regularly work with such data.

Page 30 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

Additionally, annually, the Contractor shall work with the COR to identify any changes to the processing and format of the reference population data (HCUP) (e.g., format of the data elements). C.6.4. UPDATE TOOLS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN, TEST AND IMPROVE THE AHRQ QI MODULES The reference population to date has consistently had an 18-month time lag. However, it is important to note that the AHRQ QI software is a tool that some Users will run on real-time data. Therefore, the codes and groupers embedded in the AHRQ QI modules going forward shall be the most recent available. In addition, the Contractor shall confirm that all codes and groupers are backward compatible through previous data years. C.6.4.1. REVIEW CHANGES IN ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ELEMENTS, CODING AND GUIDELINES Occasionally, there are changes introduced to existing fields of administrative data. For example, a code for "admitted from hospice care" in the Point of Origin field was added January 2010 to the hospital administrative data. Consideration needs to be given to the applicability of such changes to the AHRQ QIs. The Contractor shall review all coding guidelines and considerations from the National Uniform Billing Committee and create a list of changes annually as it applies to the AHRQ QIs. The Contractor shall work with the COR to identify any data related changes to the processing and format of the reference population data (HCUP). The Contractor shall review all annual changes and updates to national coding systems and coding practice guidelines. ICD and MS-DRG updates are usually made available on August 1 of every year and go into effect on October 1 for the following year (e.g., FY 2013 changes went into effect October 1, 2012). In addition, the Contractor should expect that annual coding changes may occur with ICD-9, ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS, and HCPCS/CPT schema. The Contractor shall be knowledgeable of, and anticipate changes in, ICD-9, ICD-10 and CPT-4 codes, the CMS submission forms, such as the UB04 and its successor. In addition, the Contractor shall implement a process which can be flexible enough to integrate changes not yet anticipated without creating undue burden on resources. The Contractor shall proactively compile a list of all coding updates to the AHRQ QI modules by the end of the previous fiscal year. The Contractor shall make recommendations to AHRQ regarding administrative coding as it relates to the AHRQ QIs. C.6.4.2. ICD-10-CM/ICD-10-PCS SET NAMES, TESTING, AND CODING UPDATES It is expected that beginning October 1, 2014, ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS will become the new standard for coding diagnoses and procedures in hospital discharge data. The Contractor shall re-specify and test all measures in AHRQ QI modules in accordance with the guidance provided by the Code Maintenance Project Panel convened by the NQF (NQF, 2010). The majority of conversions to ICD-10 coded AHRQ QI modules will have been completed prior to this contract (Cox and Romano, July 2013; Center for Health Policy, 2011), with each of the indicators having a corresponding set of ICD-10-CM/PCS codes that match the clinical intent of the ICD-9-CM coded modules. Annual updates will be accomplished under this task. In
Page 31 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

addition, revisions to ICD-10-coded AHRQ QI modules will be made if necessary because of incorrect code assignment during the conversion process. Beginning October, 2014, the Contractor shall support both ICD-9 and ICD-10-CM/PCS versions of the AHRQ QI software (in both SAS and Windows implementations). Initially, the ICD-10-CM/PCS version of the AHRQ QI will not include a reference population, as no database is available. The Contractor is expected to provide the documentation and software that include ICD-10-CM/PCS coding of numerators and denominators. The Contractor will be provided a small dual-coded database to test the integrity of the software. The Contractor will be expected to use ICD-10-CM/PCS-coded HCUP databases to serve as a reference population, beginning when 2015 ICD-10-CM/PCS databases are available. The Contractor shall ensure that both versions are fully tested, accurate, and developed using good quality control metrics. The contractor shall provide full documentation for both versions, updating the QI site so as to make both versions and their documentation easily available and usable. The Contractor shall provide full technical support for both versions, consistent with the requirements of section C.9 below. Technical support shall include logging and summarizing for AHRQ all concerns, issues, and feedback received concerning the new versions. The contractor shall provide additional documentation, technical assistance, and dissemination activities that publicize the new versions, explain differences between the old and new versions, and assist QI software users in transitioning from one version to the other. The Contractor shall evaluate any questions raised and/or issues that occurred to recommend to AHRQ whether the transition to ICD-10CM/PCS warranted maintaining or dropping the ICD9 versions of the software tools. By December 2016, the decision to support only the ICD-10CM/PCS versions shall be made by the AHRQ COR. Barring any significant problems with the new versions and concerns raised by the user community, it is anticipated that ICD-9-CM versions shall no longer be updated and maintained past 2015 data year, although the contractor shall continue to make them available in QI Web archives and provide their users, if any, with technical support as necessary. The Contractor shall routinely compile a list of all coding updates to the AHRQ QI modules by September 30th of each year. C.6.4.3. GROUPER SOFTWARE AND CLASSIFICATION SCHEME UPDATES A number of clinical grouping methodologies in addition to MS-DRGs and MDCs are employed in the AHRQ QIs in various capacities, such as identifying denominator exclusions, and risk adjustment. The primary grouping methodologies that are used, or could be proposed to be used, in the AHRQ QIs include but are not limited to:   Comorbidity Software (http://www.hcupus.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/comorbidity/comorbidity.jsp) Clinical Classifications Software for ICD-9-CM (http://www.hcupus.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/ccs.jsp)

Clinical Classifications Software for ICD-10 (http://www.hcupus.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/icd_10/ccs_icd_10.jsp) CMS Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) Risk Adjustment (Pope et al., 2011) (http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/RiskAdjustors.html) Medicare Severity-Diagnostic Related Groups (MS-DRGs) Modified DRGs as described in the Empirical Methods Document ­ to be provided by AHRQ Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC) and CMS Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Grouper available through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) http://www.ntis.gov/products/grouper.aspx 3M All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRGs) (http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M_Health_Information_Systems/HIS/Pr oducts/APRDRG_Software/) RACHS-1(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15283367)

The above grouping methodologies are maintained by arrangements outside of this contract with the exception of Modified DRGs. The Modified DRGs are essentially a cross-walking and collapsing of related MS-DRGs and CMS-DRGs for the construction of groupings used in risk adjustment. The Modified DRGs shall be annually reviewed and updated by the Contractor, and consideration should be given as to whether the Modified DRG should continue to be used with the AHRQ QIs. The Contractor shall coordinate updates on 3M APR-DRGs with AHRQ and with 3M staff. The Contractor shall be aware of standing limited license agreements and work collaboratively with 3M to get the most recent updates. Updates from 3M include software that is 32-bit and 64bit compatible that can stand alone or be embedded within AHRQ WinQI software. In regard to the other grouping methodologies, the Contractor shall annually review and analyze them for revisions and the appropriate integration into the AHRQ QIs. RACHS-1 is only used in the risk adjustment for pediatric heart surgery mortality measure (PDI 6). The Contractor shall facilitate the necessary agreements between AHRQ and Children's Hospital in Boston to regularly receive updates of RACHS-1. The Contractor shall routinely compile a list of all grouping updates, including but not limited to coding updates, changes in the version of software or software requirements, that may relate to the AHRQ QI modules by September 30th of each year. C.6.4.4. CO-STEWARD INDICATOR UPDATES Currently, AHRQ has co-stewardship agreements with Children's Hospital of Boston regarding two indicators: RACHS-1 Pediatric Heart Surgery Mortality Rate ­ NQF 339 (AHRQ PDI 6) and RACHS-1 Pediatric Heart Surgery Volume ­ NQF 0340 (AHRQ PDI 7). AHRQ also has a co-stewardship agreement with National Perinatal Information Center for Birth Trauma Rate ­ Injury to Neonate (previously NQF endorsed 0474) (AHRQ PSI 17).

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

The Contractor shall be mindful of these and any future co-steward agreements in the refinement and future development of these indicators, working collaboratively with AHRQ and the co-steward to harmonize the measure on an annual basis. C.6.4.5. MAINTAIN AGREEMENTS The Contractor shall catalog co-stewardship agreements, memoranda of understanding (MOU), license agreements, data use agreements, etc. The Contractor shall maintain a schedule of renewal for these agreements, provide initial revisions (if any) and facilitate the continuation of the agreements at the discretion of the COR. The Contractor is responsible for maintaining and updating contact information, as needed. While the Contractor works with AHRQ to facilitate these agreements and harmonization efforts, the parties to the agreements and harmonization efforts are AHRQ and the organization. C.6.5 CREATE SAS SOFTWARE MODULE AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR WINDOWS-BASED SOFTWARE TOOL The technical specifications of the AHRQ QIs are conveyed not only through documentation but also by the creation of SAS software programs. These programs while the basis of development of the AHRQ QIs; serve as a mechanism of transparency to convey to users how the AHRQ QIs are created and as an application for AHRQ QI users to calculate their own rates. The Contractor shall update and deliver all SAS programs on an annual basis and on a periodic basis, as requested by the COR. Updates to the software are based on updates to the technical specifications of the AHRQ QIs as well as required for the calculation of risk adjusted, risk stratified and smoothed rates. Previous versions of the AHRQ QI software handle missing Present on Admission (POA) data using a prediction module based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (as described in the Empirical Methods Report). Going forward, the prediction module will no longer be supported by AHRQ. The Contractor is not expected to maintain or support the prediction module in future versions. In addition, the Contractor may be asked to stream-line and add technical clarification comments so that the SAS programs run as efficiently as possible. The Contractor shall provide a SAS QI instruction manual (reviewed and approved by AHRQ) with each release of the AHRQ QIs. Periodically, the Contractor will be asked to deliver supplemental SAS programs to meet the needs of external users of the AHRQ QIs, as identified in Section C.15. Beginning with Version 4.1, the AHRQ QI SAS software does not support weighted QI estimates or standard errors for weighted estimates. Future versions of the AHRQ QI software shall enable the calculation of weighted QI estimates from complex sampling designs. AHRQ will provide the necessary methodological and analytic information to implement these and other substantial updates to future versions of the AHRQ QI software. This may include, but is not

C.7. MAINTAIN AND REFINE AHRQ QI SOFTWARE TOOLS The AHRQ QI software allows users to calculate QI rates based on their own administrative data using a standard desktop computer. Each version of the QIs is released with software in two different platforms: a SASŽ application and a Windows application. The SAS software, while used to develop the AHRQ QIs, is also disseminated to AHRQ QI users. The WinQI software is geared only for AHRQ QI users, as an easy-to-use, low-cost resource for calculating the QIs that was not dependent on licensed software. C.7.1 CREATE, MAINTAIN AND UPDATE WINDOWS-BASED QI (WINQI) SOFTWARE TOOL The AHRQ QI initiative includes a Windows-based software program that was created in order to provide an easy-to-use, low-cost option for calculating the QIs that was not dependent on licensed software. Developed on MicrosoftŽ Visual Studio using C# and .NET, AHRQ WinQI runs on Windows operating systems and requires only freely available software components: AHRQ-produced software, Microsoft .NET (for runtime environment and core software libraries), and Microsoft SQL Server Express (for data storage and manipulation). Beginning in Version 4.5, the WinQI software is available in 32-bit or 64-bit applications. The 32-bit applications are targeted for Windows XP operating systems, and the 64-bit applications are targeted for Windows 7 operating systems. The creation, maintenance and testing of the Windows-based AHRQ QI software requires the Contractor to engage expert software developers with extensive knowledge of C#, .NET, SQL and the ability to read and understand SAS, effective communication, organization, coordination across various tasks, and detailed documentation within the project. C.7.1.1. Provide Quality Assurances for WinQI Software The Contractor shall establish and adhere to a high level of software development, testing, documentation and quality control standards and procedures, in accordance with the AHRQ System Development Life Cycle Policy (SDLC). Also, the Contractor shall provide system administration and other database monitoring, tuning and administration software to support efficient and high quality operations of the data processing and data tasks under this contract. The Contractor shall deliver documentation of the proposed procedures and tools to be used for these functions and review the proposal with the COR for concurrence. The Contractor shall provide AHRQ with documentation templates for each component of the standard SDLC. The SDLC shall be subject to review and approval by AHRQ. The Contractor shall propose an SDLC approach that they consider appropriate for the WinQI project; the approach at a minimum shall address the following components:  Requirements analysis, including business-level requirements, technical-level requirements, requirements traceability  Design plan documentation  Implementation  Iterative testing and test plan documentation

The Contractor shall support efficient and secure computing operations and shall utilize software workflow, document management, and other collaboration tools and products to support efficient operations of functions, processes and tasks performed under this contract. On a regular basis, the Contractor shall inventory and evaluate its interim and final products to determine whether to retain or discard products to maintain efficiency. This is henceforth referred to as "trim holdings". Prior to final closeout and accounting, the Contractor shall create a schedule for this inventory and evaluation activity and develop a plan for returning to AHRQ all the data acquired during the contract period. The contractor shall plan to trim back to the final software production programs, logs and listings, format programs and final supporting documentation as part of the final close-out procedures (see Section C.22). The Contractor shall maintain and deliver documentation of all proposed hardware, software, security, backup / recovery, networking and other Information Technology (IT) infrastructure components and solutions needed to support all AHRQ QI contractual efforts and shall obtain approval of the proposed solutions from the COR. At the direction of the COR, the Contractor shall support AHRQ in preparing responses to periodic DHHS reporting requirements for accounting for information technology (IT) activities within the AHRQ QI project. For example, DHHS requires that projects with an IT component distinguish between those costs which are Development/Modernization/Enhancement (DME) and those which are Steady State (SS) and report annually on these expenditures. The Contractor shall be able to provide support to AHRQ in assessing and reporting such information. Also, per the new Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) reporting requirements, the contractor will be required to periodically collect automated vulnerability scanning data and hardening configuration data for all AHRQ owned systems. The actual solution chosen to conduct vulnerability and configuration scanning is at the discretion of the contractor, but the report data must be exported in a Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) compliant format. Many industry leaders recognized vulnerability and configuration management tools, including Tenable Nessus, McAfee, and Symantec offer SCAP compliant products. C.7.1.2 Routine and Non-Routine Updates to the Software The Contractor shall perform routine and non-routine updates on the WinQI software on an annual basis, based on refinements and enhancements identified in Section 6. The Contractor shall make the revised software available on the AHRQ QI Website in the beginning of the second quarter of the calendar year. The Contractor shall provide a summary of all new coding changes to the COR with information about whether and how each coding change affects the
Page 37 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

indicator definitions, empirical performance, and software. The Contractor shall maintain AHRQ QI software programs from previous years and the revised programs on the AHRQ QI Web site and shall distinguish them clearly to enable users to select the programs applicable to their needs. The Contractor shall review all aspects of each software tool to ensure they are up-to-date, including programs, format libraries, online documentation and instructions. In addition, throughout the year, the Contractor shall make enhancements, revisions, and corrections to the tools based on feedback from users, as directed by the COR. The Contractor shall ensure that all software tools and their documentation are designed for the AHRQ QI Web site, with special attention to making the tools easy to use and accessible to a wide range of users. Prior to the release of all updated tools, the Contractor shall perform a thorough double check of all changes to the tools and test the tools on data to check their accuracy and to ensure that no errors have been introduced. Examples of routine updates may include, but are not limited to:           Addition and/or removal of ICD-9, ICD-10-CM/PCS, DRG, MDC codes from code lists Additional of data elements (not more than 5 per year) Renaming data elements to be consistent with UB-04 terminology (instead of HCUP data element names) Application of the most recent version of the MS-DRG Grouper software Application of most recent version of the CCS and comorbidity software Inclusion of the 3M limited license APR-DRG software Modification of inclusion/exclusion logic for numerators Modification of inclusion/exclusion logic for provider indicator denominators Modification of denominator inclusion/exclusion logic for area indicators Modification to reflect changes in coding of existing administrative data elements or addition of new data elements

Whenever problems, errors, or other issues requiring correction or modification are observed in released AHRQ QI software, data files, or other materials, the Contractor shall, at the COR's discretion, promptly resolve such issues by providing a non-routine maintenance release. The Contractor shall follow SDLC processes for these releases. Examples of non-routine but planned updates may include, but are not limited to:  Inclusion of the most recent version of the NTIS CMS DRG grouper software

Exclusion of the Modified DRG grouper Validation and cleaning of the data within the software Handling of small cell population estimates Inclusion of disease specific population data Weighting of estimates Inclusion of mapping tools Inclusion of cost-saving calculations

C.7.2. Implement Quality Assurance Activities for SAS and WinQI Software The Contractor shall include quality assurance activities in the process to ensure creation of accurate software logic and code and reduce the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies. Additionally, as users apply the AHRQ QI software tools to their own data, potential problems in data processing and/or software logic may be uncovered, although this rarely is expected to occur. At the direction of the COR, the Contractor shall fully investigate these potential problems, report back to the COR, and rectify the problems if necessary, as directed by the COR. C.7.2.1. Audit and Review of Source Code against Documented Measure Specifications In Years 2 and 4, the Contractor shall implement an audit of the software code to ensure consistency against the measure specifications. Any differences and inconsistencies must be identified to the COR and resolved at least 4 weeks prior to external testing. The audit shall be conducted by an external subcontractor with expertise in applying the QI software to hospital discharge data. In addition to audits, software testing, such as routine testing against a constructed test suite shall be used to demonstrate that the software correctly implements the technical specifications. C.7.2.2 COMPARISON TESTING BETWEEN SAS AND WINQI SOFTWARE The Contractor shall perform testing to ensure consistency between SAS and WinQI software. Testing must be performed in the 32-bit and the 64-bit environment, using a subset of the reference population data. Testing shall include a ratio of SAS statistic over the WinQI statistic for observed numerators and denominators, observed rates, expected rates, risk-adjusted rates and smoothed rates, where applicable. In addition, testing should include a comparison of differences in numerators, denominators, observed rates, expected rates and smoothed rates at the provider-level but reported in the aggregate. All discrepancies between the SAS and WinQI software must be reviewed by the COR, with subsequent direction about that which is fixed within the software and that which is explained by the software. The most current report showing testing results between the two software platforms can be found at: http://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Downloads/Software/V45/SASWinQI%20comparison.pdf

C.7.2.3 Check the Consistency in Rates with Previous Years The Contractor shall compare the AHRQ QI rates from previous years to the current year, using WinQI. The process of comparison should be similar to the one described under Section C.7.2, as directed by the COR. C.7.2.4. Apply Quality Control Edits The Contractor shall thoroughly review the measure specifications and code and make recommendations for changes, additions or deletions to improve the software code to the COR. Once reviewed and finalized, the Contractor shall incorporate these improvements into the software program. The Contractor shall review and update the list yearly for the remainder of the contract, in consultation with the COR. C.7.2.5. Provide Other Checks and Documentation Up to 4 times a contract year, the COR may request a report of additional quality control checks of the software code prior to the public release. The Contractor shall maintain a detailed and comprehensive document of quality control checks performed, status and its resolution. C.7.2.6. Comprehensive Testing Plan of QI Software The Contractor shall develop and submit to the COR a comprehensive testing plan which includes but is not limited to:     Confirms accuracy of rate calculations Assures accuracy of inclusion and exclusion criteria Confirms consistency between the SAS and Windows software versions Confirms parameter estimates are implemented correctly

The testing should be completed using at a minimum HCUP SID for the most current year available and the HCUP NIS for the most current year available. The testing plan must document the rationale for each activity described. Upon the COR's review and approval, the Contractor shall implement the testing plan each year. C.7.2.7. Document Errors in Software Versions The Contractor shall keep a log of errors requiring the re-issuing of software versions and updates. The log shall include the name of the measure affected, the type of error, where the error originated and the way it was detected, corrective steps taken to address it, action steps taken to ensure this type of error does not re-occur, and resources used to correct the error. The log shall also include the time and cost that it took to correct the error. The Contractor shall submit this log annually to the COR.

C.7.3. Develop the QI Comparison Report The Contractor shall prepare a QI Comparison Report consisting of two parts. Part 1 of this report compares QI rates from the HCUP SIDs and NIS to prior years. Note that much of the report can be updated in anticipation of completing the analysis to facilitate an expedited release of the report. Part 2 of this report focuses on comparability of all QI rates between the SAS and Windows-based software. C.7.4. Release Updated Software Tools The Contractor shall develop a software release plan. This plan will include timelines and processes for ensuring communication with the user community in advance of a software release. Upon the COR's approval, the Contractor shall make the AHRQ QI software and documentation publicly available in January of each contract year. C.7.5. AHRQ Application and System Development Requirements AHRQ has implemented a Distributed Systems Engineering Lab (DSEL) to support all internal development efforts and provide the facility for housing the software and documentation for all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted. AHRQ uses a System Development Lifecycle (SDLC) framework which is consistent with the HHS Enterprise Lifecycle Framework (EPLC). This framework is the basis for implementation of the DSEL, conduct of development projects and the Rational Unified Process (RUP)/Capability Maturity Model (CMM) based processes that support its implementation. The SDLC framework provides a disciplined approach which employs the following traditional project phases:          Concept Initiation Planning Requirements Analysis Design Development Testing Implementation / Deployment Operations and Maintenance

Retirement

The AHRQ SDLC framework is closely aligned with the disciplines defined in the Rational Unified Process (RUP). The IBM Rational Suite of tools has been adopted by the Agency to provide a standard IT development environment for AHRQ sponsored systems and application development projects. The AHRQ SDLC framework has been enhanced through the use of tailored processes and artifacts based on the RUP methodology. The documentation deliverables required for all Information Technology (IT) projects are based on specific RUP artifacts identified by AHRQ. The Rational Clear Case libraries housed within the DSEL provide the repository for housing software and documentation artifacts related to all AHRQ sponsored systems and applications, regardless of where the system or application is hosted. Contractors are not required to follow the RUP development methodology or use the Rational Suite of tools; however, the Contractor's SDLC must be capable of producing AHRQrequired system deliverables containing the required content as described further in Appendix 5. It is required that the Contractor use the lifecycle phases defined in the AHRQ SDLC framework and obtain the COR's approval before moving from one phase to another. This approval process corresponds to the stage gates in the HHS EPLC model. The Contractor must also conform to AHRQ Configuration Management (CM) and change control standards which require appropriate controls for managing software and documentation baselines, changes to software artifacts using an appropriate IDE or version management tool, document change requests and obtaining approval through a formal change control process that requires COR and possible AHRQ IT approval prior to implementation. Appendix 5 identifies the documentation deliverables required for all IT projects and the content required for each deliverable.

C.8. DELIVERY AND MANAGEMENT OF THE AHRQ QI MODULES: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS, SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION Keeping a record of activities for AHRQ QI is a vital part of every task undertaken for the project. The Contractor shall generate documentation to accompany all AHRQ QI components (e.g., databases, software, products, and reports) as they are developed and maintain the information in an organized, consistent manner that retains institutional memory. The Contractor shall observe naming conventions and version controls strictly and the naming conventions shall be self-explanatory. Examples of AHRQ QI documentation are located at www.qualityindicators.ahrq.hhs.gov. The Contractor shall store documentation, software programs, and data files in a manner that shall protect the information while allowing appropriate access.

For the purposes of scheduling, the Contractor shall assume that the NQMC updates will occur in May of the calendar year. C.10.2. National Healthcare Quality Report (NHQR) & National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHDR) Each year, as part of the production of the NHQR and NHDR, AHRQ applies the AHRQ QI software to the HCUP NIS, SID, NEDS and SEDD datasets, and a special analytic file that supports national QI estimates by race/ethnicity for the NHDR. The main products include consistently defined QI estimates in tables, documentation of methods, special analyses, and coordination with HCUP Partners. The latter effort aims to support States in use of the Reports and seeking to obtain their permission to publish State-level estimates for the QIs in the Reports. The Contractor shall support the production of the AHRQ QI rates in the reports, by responding to technical questions, providing specialized risk adjustment tables with separate coefficients for age and gender breakouts, adapt AHRQ QI SAS programs that allow calculation of stratified rates by age and gender, and formally brief AHRQ staff working on the NHQR and NHDR at least annually on upcoming enhancements and updates to the measures and tools. The Contractor shall also provide technical support on the application and interpretation of the AHRQ QIs as directed by the COR. Previous reports and documentation of methodology can be found at http://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/index.html, and http://www.hcupus.ahrq.gov/reports/methods/2012_03.pdf for the 2012 NHQR and NHDR. For the purposes of scheduling for the proposal, Offerors should assume that all required software and documentation materials will be delivered in March of the calendar year. C.10.3. HCUP Partners The AHRQ QI project relies heavily on the databases and supplemental files created and supported under the HCUP partnership. Data organizations voluntarily participate in HCUP by allowing the inclusion of their data and by participating in project initiatives, including the AHRQ QIs. As such, the AHRQ QI project is committed to supporting the HCUP Partners in their use of the AHRQ QIs. HCUP Partners are generally interested in receiving additional guidance and technical assistance on the application and uses of the AHRQ QIs. In the past, HCUP Partners have requested AHRQ to facilitate communication and information exchange among Partners about using the AHRQ QIs in public reporting and quality improvement initiatives. Such support provided by the AHRQ QI project ultimately improves the quality, consistency and usefulness of the AHRQ QI measures and tools. The purpose of this task is to provide technical support for HCUP Partners to facilitate their use of the AHRQ QI measures and tools in their own state specific quality improvement and public reporting initiatives. The

Page 54 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

lead of this task shall serve as the HCUP liaison for the QI project. The Contractor shall ensure this liaison is aware and able to help resolve all inquiries submitted by the HCUP partners. The Contractor shall perform the tasks specified below to provide AHRQ QI technical support to Partners. The Contractor shall participate in quarterly conference calls with AHRQ staff on this task and provide a quarterly report to AHRQ summarizing task activities. The report shall include brief descriptions of workgroup calls, LISTSERV activity, brief descriptions of conferences, brief descriptions of Federal and national initiatives, postings on the website, individualized technical assistance to Partners, etc. as it relates to HCUP Partners.

C.10.3.1. Provide Technical Assistance to HCUP Partners Consistent with the standard procedures established under the technical assistance task, all HCUP Partners shall receive timely technical assistance (within 24 hours). The Contractor shall notify the COR immediately of any HCUP Partner queries, the issue in question, the solution and the time frame for implementing that solution. The Contractor shall copy the COR on all email correspondence with HCUP Partners and notify in writing of all telephone conversations. The Contractor shall ensure that the COR participates in the telephone conversations, unless the COR indicates otherwise. C.10.3.2. Conduct HCUP Partner Workgroup The Contractor shall support an AHRQ workgroup of representatives from HCUP Partner organizations when the need arises, as directed by the COR. The workgroup may be on specific measurement topic areas of interest to Partners or AHRQ or they may be focused on specific issues related to the AHRQ QI software. The Contractor shall handle all the logistical arrangements for the conference calls, such as notification of meeting time, agenda, conference call phone line, and minutes of the calls. The Contractor shall anticipate one active workgroup with three calls per year. The size of the workgroup shall vary depending on the nature of the workgroup objective and Partner interest. The Contractor shall develop summaries of the calls and make them available electronically to the participants and ready for posting on HCUP-US, at the discretion of the COR. C.10.4. My Own Network, Powered by AHRQ (MONAHRQŽ) The Contractor shall support the MONAHRQ project in the following ways:  Support the creation of new MONAHRQ software packages that incorporate AHRQ QIs as needed. Provide documentation and/or technical assistance to help MONAHRQ developers understand and work with AHRQ QIs and software, as needed. Such documentation or assistance is particularly important when new features or major new updates to the QIs occur. Although the MONAHRQ project provides its own technical support, some assistance may be required to help MONAHRQ Technical Assistance (TA) respond to user requests that deal with the Quality Indicators or Windows QI software specifically.

Page 55 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV



Because MONAHRQ incorporates the AHRQ QIs, the Contractor shall communicate and coordinate with MONAHRQ developers when planning updates to the QI software. These updates may affect how the AHRQ QI software interacts with or is used by MONAHRQ. Examples include changes to the QI technical specification that change the meaning, labels or range of rates, QI software's internal database structure, data load process, user interface, and the interface between the AHRQ QI WinQI with the MONAHRQ user interface. More significant examples of software updates include adding new measures or introducing new features such as time trend analysis or stratification options. Where relevant, the Contractor shall ensure that changes to the QI software are planned such that they can be incorporated in MONAHRQ in a timely and efficient manner. In coordination with MONAHRQ developers, implement changes to the QI software that directly support the MONAHRQ project. A modest example is enabling the QI software to output measure results in a specific format needed by MONAHRQ. A more significant example is restructuring the Windows QI software so as to make the MONAHRQ build process more efficient and error free.

Page 58 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

Web pages and documents created under this effort shall be in compliance with Section 508. If existing content is found to be not compliant, the Contractor shall re-format such documents to ensure compliance with section 508 of the American Disabilities Act and provide them to the AHRQ QI web site manager. C.11.1.3. Adhere to AHRQ WEB PRODUCT AND WEB SITE DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES The following section highlights basic issues that need to be addressed when developing Web pages, tools or sites under contract that will be publicly available when launched to ensure deliverables are on target, in compliance with legal and policy requirements, and do not require expensive rework to meet Federal and Department of Health and Human Services requirements for information resources. Retrofitting Web-based products after the fact is highly undesirable because it adds time and costs to the process of making these products publicly available. The Contractor shall ensure that all products that are developed with the intent of being posted on the AHRQ Web site meet the minimum requirements noted below. The Contractor shall note that since the website is being hosted on an AHRQ server, some of these requirements may not be applicable. The Contractor is expected to adhere to all applicable requirements. C.11.1.3.1. Titles of Products Coordinate with your COR on the titles of your products. They need to be concise and relevant to the purpose of the project, but cannot include the name of the contractor or grantee as the performing organization as part of the title. Report titles should be no more than 10-words maximum and Web-based tools should be no more than 5-words maximum (make every word count--eliminate initial articles such as "The" or "A" ). Titles need to be distinct enough to differentiate among similar sounding products. C.11.1.3.2. Quality Control/Editorial Review This involves checking for spelling and grammar mistakes, formatting issues, general consistency, and style. This should be done by the AHRQ contractor prior to submission of the final product for posting on the AHRQ Web site. Federal resources follow the GPO Style Manual which is available electronically at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2008.html . C.11.1.3.3. Accessibility As an agency of the Federal Government, AHRQ must ensure that anything that is posted on our Web site is in compliance with requirements for information resources under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Also, federally funded resources need to be generally available to users in multiple formats to ensure that we are not forcing a particular platform, operational system, or proprietary software package on users.

C.11.1.3.4. Intellectual Property Rights Before we can post a product on the AHRQ Web site, we must have a written explanation (which the Contractor shall provide) of the following four questions:     Who retains the copyright? Who has licenses for what purposes and uses? What are the constraints imposed? Who grants permission for further use or adoption?

C.11.1.3.5. Editorial Review All content for upload needs to be reviewed to ensure consistency and compliance with best practices and established style and conventions. As a minimum, the copy needs to be production edited to ensure there are no typos and the GPO Style Manual is followed for punctuation, spelling, use of numerals, abbreviations, etc. Do not use unexplained acronyms; they need to be spelled out on first reference in any document or file. There should not be anything marked DRAFT on a public site. Once the materials are uploaded, they are published and considered in the "public domain." Do not use placeholders for content that does not exist. Government funded sites should not have anything designated "under construction." A process needs to be established for regular review of content and updating. Additional materials need to undergo editorial review and be approved before uploading. The GPO Style Guide is available electronically as a reference at: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/browse.html C.11.1.3.6. Accessibility Under the Rehabilitation Act, Federal agencies have an obligation to provide equal access for the disabled to their information and services. Requirements are specified in section 504 for individual accommodation and more recently in section 508 for electronic and information technology, which includes Web sites and multimedia products. Equivalent alternatives are required for auditory and visual information, such as providing alternative descriptive text for images for the blind and providing captions for audio-video files for the deaf. Written transcripts are required for all streaming audio. PDF files can be offered in conjunction with accessible files, such as HTML versions, but avoid uploading PDF-only versions of documents unless they are fully accessible PDF formats. AHRQ has software used to evaluate Web sites and can provide a report on any accessibility violations that would need to be addressed before launch. Specific requirements are available at: http://www.section508.gov C.11.1.3.7. Privacy A privacy policy notice must be prominently displayed, and the Web site host has to follow it. A machine-readable format (P3P) of the privacy policy notice must also be uploaded to the site. A Privacy Impact Assessment is conducted to determine what kind of personal information
Page 60 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

is contained within a system, what is done with that information, and how that information is protected. Sites are periodically audited to ensure that they observe their stated privacy policy. A Privacy Act System notice may need to be prepared and published for users to register on a site if the registrations represent a group of records, under the control of the Agency (or a contractor), that can be retrieved by personal identifier. This notice must go through several levels of review-including the Office of General Counsel--and be published in the Federal Register. Persistent cookies cannot be used on Federal sites unless the Secretary of HHS grants an exemption, and this involves a strong justification and review process. C.11.1.3.8. Web Site Mailbox Every Web site must provide full contact information for AHRQ and have a Contact Us link for submission of comments or questions as a customer feedback mechanism. Web site e-mail is subject to the same privacy and records management issues that affect the overall Web site as well as departmental standards for handling inquiries and customer feedback. Each Web site must provide relevant Frequently Asked Questions that are included in the customer relationship management system used to handle AHRQ Web site inquiries. C.11.1.3.9. Records Management All content on the site and e-mail generated by the site must be archived electronically and handled according to records retention schedules and disposition authorities as established with the National Archives and Record Administration. This requirement also affects Web site log files and statistical reporting on Web site usage. For guidance on requirements, go to: http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/managing-web-records-index.html C.11.1.3.10. Information Collection Budget If a Web site is used to collect information from users, such as for surveys, evaluations, or beta testing feedback, then the Office of Management and Budget must first approve the burden hours for such an effort for this collection. A notice must be posted on the Web site at the point of collection with the OMB approval number and a statement on the process of collection. C.11.1.3.11. Intellectual Property Copyright and trademark protections need to be observed on Web sites. Permissions for use must be granted for any copyrighted information included and registered trademarks need to be reflected in copy. Any copyright or trademark constraints related to materials uploaded to a site must be specified for users. Public domain does not extend outside the borders of the United States. Therefore, foreign countries must request specific permission for use. Given the global nature of the Internet, citation as to source is a critical issue.

C.12.2.1.15. MAINTENANCE. The Contractor shall ensure that the system, once operational, is properly maintained and monitored, to include immediate response to critical security patches, routine maintenance windows to allow for system updates, and compliance with a defined configuration management process. All patches and system updates shall be properly tested in a development environment before being implemented in the production environment. C.12.3. Adhere to Other Confidentiality and Security Provisions Data from other sources may be required to test or validate existing measures and tools. In such cases, the Contractor shall adhere to the policies, security protocols and requirements of the data proprietor. In some instances, the Contractor may be required to submit data use agreements, formal data requests and/or request Institutional Review Board approval for use of hospital specific records. C.12.4. Adhere to Legal Protections


The statute that governs AHRQ activities (Section 924[c] of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)]) (http://www.ahrq.gov/policymakers/hrqa99a.html), requires that information that might identify an individual cannot be used for any purpose other than the explicit purpose for which it is collected. In the case of the HCUP data, the purpose is limited to conducting research and developing statistical estimates. Information that could be used to identify persons, either those included in the database or those who are the source of information, cannot be released without specific permission from the individual. In addition to the statute that deals specifically with AHRQ, the Agency, like all Federal agencies, must adhere to the protections included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (as amended) (5 U.S.C. 552a) www.justice.gov/opcl/privstat.htm. This Act also restricts the use and dissemination of identifiable information and imposes criminal penalties for violations. The Privacy Act is similar to, but not as restrictive as, the specific AHRQ statutory protections.

AHRQ's use of the HCUP data acquired from the data organization is also subject to any other limitations that may be imposed on or by the data organization. Specifically, AHRQ shall observe and be bound by any state statutory requirements governing the data organization's release of these data and any additional requirements specified in the HCUP MOA and its addenda between AHRQ and the data organization. C.12.5. Catalogue and Return All Data All data files provided under this contract are for the sole purpose of supporting the AHRQ QI maintenance and update process and may not be used for any other purpose. Data files used under this contract shall be catalogued and returned to AHRQ at the completion of the task unless otherwise specified by the COR. Data shall be provided to the Contractor either on CD, DVD or via a secure Internet transfer to a central AHRQ data warehouse. It is possible that
Page 70 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

future years of this contract shall require other formats and/or media based on emerging or existing technologies. C.12.6. Complete Privacy Training Tools on Security and Confidentiality of Data HCUP requires privacy training for all persons given access to HCUP data (both internal and external to AHRQ). AHRQ staff and contractors are required to sign an HCUP DUA, and Staff/Contractor Agreement. Electronic HCUP privacy training has been developed for internal AHRQ staff and Contractors and is required on an annual basis. The HCUP Privacy Training Tool and DUA Training Tool are maintained on the HCUP-US Web site (links will be provided by the government at the appropriate time). In addition, the Contractor shall complete HHS data security and privacy training. The Contractor shall keep a detailed log of all staff that have fulfilled the HHS and HCUP data security and privacy requirements and update on an annual basis. The Contractor should estimate this requiring approximately 90 minutes annually per project staff with access to data.

C.13. Support and Maintain Measures Based on Electronic Health Records Healthcare adoption and use of EHRs creates new opportunities for the AHRQ QI program. By utilizing this rich source of clinical information, the AHRQ QIs have the potential to identify potential quality concerns more quickly and more accurately than ever before. Electronic capture and real-time access to clinical patient data will likely facilitate communication of care between health care providers to ensure overall better quality of care. To this end, AHRQ is positioning its AHRQ QIs to be able to capitalize on the clinical data documented in EHRs such that any hospitals and/or systems that are transitioning to the electronic environment can generate them in a timely and accurate manner. The purpose of this task is to electronically specify existing AHRQ QIs that will be used for reporting by hospitals using certified EHR systems. As noted earlier, several AHRQ QIs are included in the CMS EHR incentive programs. The reporting of the electronic AHRQ QIs by hospitals to CMS must be in a standardized transmission format such as the Quality Reporting Document Architecture (QRDA) which will support the CMS electronic quality measure standard format used in the electronic specifications. To ensure consistency within HHS, AHRQ will be utilizing existing federal emeasure-related tools in this effort.

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

Beginning in Option Year 2, the Contractor shall: 1. Utilize the CMS measure authoring tool (MAT)), the CMS quality data model (QDM) and the CMS standardized repository for value sets (Value Set Authority Center ­ VSAC) when transitioning the AHRQ QIs to the EHR environment. 2. Ensure that the electronic QIs are consistent with industry standards for abstracting data from EHRs and transmitting data to CMS such as the Healthcare Quality Measurement Form (HQMF) and the Quality Reporting Document Architecture (QRDA). 3. Ensure that testing processes for measure e-specifications, including data elements, measure logic, shall occur throughout the transition process. 4. Ensure that the final e-specifications are ready for certification by the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC). This includes but is not limited to knowing industry standards and collaboration across federal agencies and with other stakeholders. 6. Serve as the subject matter expert on EHRs and respond to questions on the e-measures as needed. C.13.1: Evaluate existing eMeasure specifications The Contractor shall explore, evaluate, and incorporate existing methodologies developed for the creation of electronic specifications of quality measures, obtaining the input of experts in this field as necessary. C.13.2: Develop eSpecifications The Contractor shall develop electronic specifications for up to 15 existing AHRQ QIs as selected by AHRQ each year, and successfully test using a certified EHR. Include all applicable code sets based on standards issued by the Office of the National Coordinator. C.13.3: Develop and implement maintenance plan The Contractor shall develop and implement a maintenance plan for eMeasures created under this task. Maintenance and updates will include, but is not limited to, creating implementation test data files to enhance and/or improve the eMeasures, updating new codes/value sets, updating logic, and monitoring for continued NQF endorsement. C.13.4: Support eMeasure technical documents The Contractor shall develop all technical documents and guidance associated with the measures developed/electronically specified over the course of this contract, to be used as part of an education and outreach plan. This task also includes responding to and tracking eSpecification questions and issues raised by implementers, and providing Train-the-Trainer education and /or materials to a contract yet established to carry our Education and Outreach.

C.14. PREPARE AND SUBMIT AHRQ QIS TO THE NATIONAL QUALITY FORUM FOR ANNUAL UPDATES Below is an overview of the NQF endorsement and associated processes as it relates to NQF endorsed AHRQ QIs. The endorsement and maintenance process requires the demonstration that measures meet a certain standard, and the evaluation of the measures should be based on rigorous, current, evidence-based methodology as prescribed on the NQF endorsement process (www.qualityforum.org). NQF endorses measures only if they pass four measure evaluation criteria: Importance to Measure and Report, Scientific Acceptability of Measure Properties, Usability, and Feasibility. More detailed information as well as the measure submission process can be found at the NQF website: www.qualityforum.org/Measuring_Performance/Consensus_Development_Process.aspx For purposes of estimating resources and costs, the Contractor shall assume: 25 measures submitted for annual updates. See the following website for new measure submission: http://www.qualityforum.org/Measuring_Performance/Submitting_Standards.aspx . The Contractor shall designate one individual with experience with NQF submissions to coordinate the submission of annual update materials to NQF. This individual shall have experience and knowledge of clinical terminology. The Contractor shall maintain and regularly update a schedule of NQF submissions, including the history of endorsement of indicators, all submissions and all updates. The Contractor shall participate in monthly development calls, NQF annual meeting and ad-hoc meetings, as directed by the COR. C.14.1. Maintain NQF Endorsed AHRQ QI Measures In late 2010, the NQF maintenance process was revised to essentially mirror the initial measure submission process in terms of the type and extent of effort of the measure stewards. See the section above for details. Maintenance occurs every three years for each measure, but could be within 18 months of the previous endorsement depending on the dates of steering committee meetings. There are some variations in the maintenance process compared to the initial submission process. One difference is a comment phase regarding users' experiences with the implementation of the measure. All such comments on the AHRQ QIs require review and a typed response. Given that the NQF measure maintenance is on a 18-month to three-year cycle, and assuming the current NQF maintenance schedule, AHRQ anticipates that in a given year an average of 18 measures will be due for maintenance. The deadlines for submission of maintenance material are dependent on NQF schedules of Steering Committee meetings. The Contractor shall perform such activities as, but not limited to: a) Completion of measure submission form (assuming portions of the material in the pre-populated form are relevant and other aspects require revising) b) Preparation for, and participation in, three NQF committee meetings by 2 staff via conference call or webinar
Page 73 of 174

c) Responding to comments in the review and comment phase and ad hoc follow up requests from the above steps The Contractor shall submit all completed forms for COR review and approval within 3 weeks of NQF submission deadline. Following approval, the Contractor shall submit all necessary documentation to NQF. C.14.2. Summary Report on NQF Activity The Contractor shall summarize all activities in Section C.14 in an annual report to the AHRQ COR.

C.15. Maintain Inventory of AHRQ QIs Used in Published Literature, Grey Literature and Public Reports The Contractor shall search for and maintain a list of organizations that use AHRQ QI measures in national, state or local public reporting or pay for performance programs, quality improvement efforts and public health initiatives. The Contractor shall also create and maintain a bibliography of published articles and an inventory of reports on the use of the AHRQ QIs for quality improvement, public reporting and pay for performance purposes. The Contractor shall employ a systematic approach to identifying these organizations and locating these publications and reports. Publications of interest include, but are not limited to, articles in peer-reviewed research and trade journals, professional forums, newspapers, and magazines. Reports of interest include, but are not limited to those published by Federal government agencies (e.g., GAO), state governments, healthcare organizations (e.g., Blue Cross), etc. The Contractor shall update the list and inventory every 12 months and shall include specifics on the organizational sponsor, specific AHRQ QI measures used in the initiative and any other relevant information.

C.16. Support Annual project close-out At the end of each contract year, the Contractor shall identify which project files, processing programs, software, documentation, and supporting materials shall be deleted, archived, or carried forward to the new contract period, and shall report on this to the COR for review and concurrence. The Contractor shall deliver software, documentation and web files deemed by the COR as the annual project files.

The first type, expository presentations shall be developed to describe the AHRQ QIs to audiences. The length of the presentation, the targeted audience and the delivery venue determine the content. Shorter presentations are cursory overviews of the AHRQ QIs. Longer presentations are a full description of the AHRQ QIs, including descriptions of the modules, specifics about individual measures, detail on the risk adjustment methods, software tools and their applications, reports and their utility. Technical training presentations shall be designed to teach audiences how to use the AHRQ QI software tools and to interpret the results. Technical training presentations demonstrate applications of software tools and interpretation of data runs. They shall incorporate hands-on learning experiences for users when possible. All presentations require knowledge of the technical aspects of hospital administrative data and the AHRQ QI software and technical specifications. Presentations must also follow AHRQ Office of Communications and Knowledge Transfer (OCKT) format guidelines. These two types of presentations shall be presented either 1) in-person with or without transmitting through an electronic medium, or 2) through electronic courseware . With the inperson presentation alternative, the presentation will typically be a PowerPoint slide show presented by either AHRQ staff or Contractor technical staff, to an audience at a conference or workshop setting. On occasion, the in-person presentation requires the audience to use computers for training. The in-person presentation may also be delivered as a web cast or webinar. The Contractor shall assess the merit of presentations after they have been delivered and recommend in a written memo ways to improve the presentations by modifying their design, organization and content. The Contractor shall suggest modifications based on the usefulness of individual presentations and how the presentations fit together as a whole in fulfilling user needs. With AHRQ approval, the Contractor shall annually modify selected existing masters to improve/update their content, structure and presentation format. The Contractor shall plan for limited professional graphic and design support that will usually be required for development of new presentation materials. The Contractor shall deliver initial, intermediate and final drafts of all presentations. Each draft requires AHRQ approval.

For Powerpoint presentations, the Contractor shall develop not just the slides but also the scripts accompanying each slide. C.22.2. Customize Masters for Specific Audiences Presentation templates (including courseware) shall serve as the foundation and be customized for specific presentations and audiences. The Contractor shall customize the content of presentations to fit the audience and venue of most presentation deliveries. Each time the AHRQ QIs are presented to a new special interest group, audience or stakeholder group, the Contractor shall select a presentation master, and tailor it to the specific needs of the audience and venue. The presentation selected as a master for customization shall be based on the length and type of presentation desired by AHRQ to be delivered. AHRQ anticipates that most new conferences, meetings and special sessions shall require customizing existing presentation templates. Presentations shall also need to be customized for audiences recommended for outreach efforts. In each year, AHRQ anticipates that five presentations shall require customization. The presentations selected for customization shall be determined by AHRQ staff independently and/or with the Contractor. C.22.3. Develop Written Support Materials The Contractor shall provide all written materials associated with each presentation. These materials include writing and submitting abstracts, announcements, invitations, handouts, flyers, information packets, and background analyses, and other similar materials as necessary, making sure that all materials contain up-to-date, accurate technical information about AHRQ QI. Written materials and general AHRQ QI materials shall be required for most presentations, and shall need to be tailored for the specific audiences. The Contractor shall plan for professional graphic and design support that may be required for development of some written materials. C.22.4. Supply Presentation Equipment The Contractor shall provide or arrange provision of all equipment associated with a presentation. This equipment may include displays, signs, posters, banners, and other presentation materials.

C.22.5. Document Presentations The Contractor shall provide an annual report that lists the presentations (including courseware) by name, with a description of them based on length, targeted audience, delivery venue, and its electronic document name. The dates and specific audiences for which they were used shall be listed for each presentation. This list shall be used to keep track of presentations, and to help AHRQ and Contractor staff decide which presentations to be used as templates for modification and customizing. C.22.6. Create promotional materials The Contractor shall design and produce two new written promotional items per year, as proposed to and approved by the COR. Examples of these items include brochures, flyers, letters, and notices. Maximum length is four pages per item. The Contractor shall also update five existing written promotional items per year, to make them accurate with current AHRQ QI information. C.22.7. Create, Coordinate, and Disseminate Written Outreach Materials The Contractor shall produce outreach promotional materials for dissemination. As indicated below, the Contractor shall ensure that all materials shall be proofread and edited by a professional technical editor. All written materials shall follow standard AHRQ/OCKT and AHRQ QI writing style. All materials produced shall use AHRQ and AHRQ QI logos and designs, when required. C.22.7.1. Create Announcements The Contractor shall write drafts and subsequent revisions, and deliver polished narratives of up to twelve announcements per year for posting on the AHRQ website, for the COR's review and approval. Each announcement shall be about 1-2 pages long. Electronic copies of all developed materials shall be provided to AHRQ as soon as possible after completion. C.22.7.2.

The Contractor shall post the calendar on the AHRQ QI team Web site. A second calendar shall be developed with a subset of

Page 86 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

these events that shall be posted on the public portion of the AHRQ QI-US Web site. The Contractor shall update the calendars weekly, or as needed. C.22.7.3. Create Quarterly AHRQ QI Newsletter The Contractor shall write and produce a quarterly newsletter that focuses on AHRQ QI news and events. The Contractor shall lead the effort from conception to final distribution-ready copy. The newsletter is written for users of AHRQ QI data and products. The Contractor shall develop a format and template for the newsletter, for the COR's review and approval. Suggested sections for the newsletter include but are not limited to the following: News and Announcements, Recent Publications, User Tech Tips, User Impact Stories and the AHRQ QI Calendar. For newsletter content, the Contractor shall identify newsworthy topics including:       New product releases New publications using AHRQ QI products Sections spotlighting users experience with AHRQ QI products Recent presentations given by staff Updates on measure development efforts Announcements of up-coming training and conferences

The newsletter shall include information on new quality reporting initiatives that use the AHRQ QIs that may be of interest to AHRQ QI users. For newsletter items that focus on measure development efforts, technical advice shall be sought from the technical lead on the AHRQ QI team. The Contractor shall prepare initial, interim and final drafts of each quarterly newsletter for AHRQ QI review. The Contractor shall have the final draft reviewed by a professional technical editor prior to AHRQ QI final review. The newsletters are to be well-written and polished.

C.23. Conduct a User Assessment Survey (Option) The Contractor shall conduct an annual user survey to assess user needs. In conjunction with the COR, the Contractor shall develop a set of questions for users to respond to that provide information on how and to what extent AHRQ QI products and tools are useful to their efforts in quality improvement, public reporting and pay for performance. Information shall primarily be obtained via the AHRQ QI Web site. The Contractor shall compile and summarize the responses. Based on the feedback provided, the Contractor shall recommend possible improvements that could be made across the project. This assessment may require clearance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Contractor shall prepare the necessary materials to submit to OMB for clearance.

C.24.

C.26 SECURITY HHS-Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security (a) To perform the work specified herein, Contractor personnel are expected to have routine (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system; (3) access to sensitive HHS data or information, whether in an HHScontrolled information system or in hard copy; or (4) any combination of circumstances (1) through (3). (b) To gain routine physical access to an HHS facility, logical access to an HHS-controlled information system, and/or access to sensitive data or information, the Contractor and its employees shall comply with Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors; Office of Management and Budget memorandum (M-05-24); and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication
Page 89 of 174

(FIPS PUB) Number 201; and with the personal identity verification and investigation procedures contained in the following documents: (1) HHS Information Security Program Policy. (2) HHS Office of Security and Drug Testing, Personnel Security/ Suitability Handbook, dated February 1, 2005. (3) HHS HSPD-12 Policy Document, v. 2.0. (c) This contract/order will entail the following position sensitivity level(s): LEVEL 5 . (d) The personnel investigation procedures for Contractor personnel require that the Contractor prepare and submit background check/investigation forms based on the type of investigation required. The minimum Government investigation for a non-sensitive position is a National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) with fingerprinting. More restricted positions--i.e., those above non-sensitive, require more extensive documentation and investigation. As part of its proposal, and if the anticipated position sensitivity levels are specified in paragraph (c) above, the Offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer of (1) its proposed personnel who will be subject to a background check/investigation and (2) whether any of its proposed personnel who will work under the contract have previously been the subject of national agency checks or background investigations. (e) Investigations are expensive and may delay performance, regardless of the outcome of the investigation. Delays associated with rejections and consequent re-investigations may not be excusable in accordance with the FAR clause, Excusable Delays--see FAR 52.249-14. Accordingly, if position sensitivity levels are specified in paragraph (c), the Offeror shall ensure that the employees it proposes for work under this contract have a reasonable chance for approval. (f) Typically, the Government investigates personnel at no cost to the Contractor. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the additional investigation(s). (g) The Contractor shall include language similar to this ``HHS-Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security'' language in all subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have the same frequency and duration of (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system; (3) access to sensitive HHS data/information, whether in an HHS-controlled information system or in hard copy; or (4) any combination of circumstances (1) through (3). (h) The Contractor shall direct inquiries, including requests for forms and assistance, to the Contracting Officer or designee. (i) Within 7 calendar days after the Government's final acceptance of the work under this contract, or upon termination of the contract, the Contractor shall return all identification badges to the Contracting Officer or designee.

b. This contract is subject to the provisions of Public Law (P.L.) 99-234 which amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act to provide that contractor costs for travel, including lodging, other subsistence, and incidental expenses, shall be allowable only to the extent that they do not exceed the amount allowed for Federal employees. The Contractor, therefore, shall invoice and be reimbursed for all travel costs in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 31.205-46.

*In addition, it is hereby agreed that the above ceiling rates are to be used for the life of the contract.

For Contractors that do not have a Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement: The Contractor shall submit an indirect cost rate proposal to their cognizant Federal agency within 90 days of contract award for the review and negotiation of provisional rates. The indirect cost rate proposal shall be submitted to the Contractor's cognizant Federal agency.

The Contractor shall submit its final indirect cost rate proposal to its cognizant Federal agency within 180 days of the completion of each Contractor fiscal year for the review and negotiation of final indirect cost rates. A proposal shall be submitted for each year the contractor has Government contracts. In the event the rates determined by the cognizant negotiated indirect cost official on the basis of actual allowable costs are less than the provisional and ceiling rates agreed to herein, then the lower rates as established by such cognizant official shall apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Contractor shall, in the case of an adjustment of the provisional rates, comply with the requirements of FAR 52.232-20 - Limitation of Cost. G.1.2 ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING Other provisions of this contract notwithstanding, the Contractor is hereby authorized to incur the following costs, within the limits set forth without further authorization under 52.244-2 entitled Subcontracts as incorporated into Section I of this contract: [to be completed with subcontractor/consultant names and limits at award]

Salary Rate Limitation (August 2012)

(a) Pursuant to the current and applicable prior HHS appropriations acts, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the federal Executive Schedule Level I in effect on the date an expense is incurred. (b) For purposes of the salary rate limitation, the terms ``direct salary,'' ``salary,'' and ``institutional base salary'' have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as ``direct salary'' in this clause.

any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs).

(c) The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals under subcontracts. If this is a multipleyear contract or order, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract or order funding.

The contractor shall include this clause in all sub-contracts awarded under this contract for supporting or performing the specified program and services. Accordingly, the contractor shall ensure that each of its employees, and any sub-contractor staff, is made aware of, understands, and complies with this policy. (End of clause)

(End of provision) K.2 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)

(a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest Page 131 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

Page 160 of 174

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

in performance of the contract. Participation in performance of the contract includes the work expected to be performed by SDB concern(s). This can include SDB's (as prime Contractor), joint ventures, teaming arrangements, and subcontracts. Offerors shall submit the following information in one clearly marked section of their business proposal: (1) The plan should express definitive commitments for the inclusion of SDB concerns in the performance of this requirement. This commitment should be formalized through the inclusion of specific names of organizations and points of contact of proposed SDB's, as well as signed agreements for designated services.

An acceptable plan must, in the determination of the Contracting Officer, provide the maximum opportunity for small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons to participate in the performance of the contract. If the apparently successful offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the contracting officer within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the offeror will be ineligible for award. Small business firms should not submit a subcontracting plan as required in FAR 19.702(b); however, they do need to propose targets for SDB participation in accordance with FAR 19.1202-4 in order to receive credit under the SDB participation evaluation factor. See instructions regarding SDB participation in Section L.5.5 above.

L.6 352.239-73(A) ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY (JANUARY 2010) (a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR Part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any federal department or agency permit(1) Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and (2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities. (b) Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm.

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

(c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability website (http://www.hhs.gov/web/508/contracting/technology/vendors.html) (d) Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 accessibility standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government - i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense. L.7 FAR 52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984) The Government anticipates the award of a cost plus fixed fee contract resulting from this solicitation. L.8 FAR 52.219-24 SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PROGRAM - TARGETS (OCT 2000) (a) This solicitation contains a source selection factor or subfactors related to the participation of small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns in the contract. Credit under that evaluation factor or subfactors is not available to an SDB concern that qualifies for a price evaluation adjustment under the clause at FAR 52.219-23, Notice of Price Evaluation Adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns, unless the SDB concern specifically waives the price evaluation adjustment. In order to receive credit under the source selection factor or subfactors, the offeror must provide, with its offer, targets, expressed as dollars and percentages of total contract value, for SDB participation in any of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsections as determined by the Department of Commerce. The targets may provide for participation by a

SECTION M - Evaluation Factors for Award M.1 GENERAL In order for proposals to be considered acceptable and eligible for evaluation, they must be prepared in accordance with and in compliance with the instructions given in this RFP and address all of the requirements set forth in the Statement of Work/Description of Requirement. Proposals which merely offer to conduct a program in accordance with the requirements of the Government's scope of work will not be eligible for an award. M.2 AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS AND COMPETITIVE RANGE DETERMINATIONS The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except for clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. In the event discussions are held, a competitive range determination will be made. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. M.3 BASIS FOR AWARD The following factors will be considered in evaluating proposals, in descending level of importance: - Technical; - Cost; - Past Performance and Small Disadvantaged Business Participation. Award will be made to that responsible Offeror whose proposal contains the combination of those factors offering the best overall value to the Government utilizing a tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101-1. This will be determined by comparing differences in technical merit, past performance and small disadvantaged business participation with differences in cost to the Government. In making this comparison the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical merit. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher cost to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical merit and past performance. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror or to the offeror with a higher technical score if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.

TOTAL POINTS BEFORE PAST PERFORMANCE

100 points

M.4.8 Factor 8 - Past Performance

25 points

Past performance information is one indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance shall be considered. This evaluation is subjective and will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Offeror (for themselves, predecessor companies, key personnel, and major subcontractors), as well as information obtained by other sources known to the Government. For the purpose of this evaluation the term "offeror" is inclusive of the prime, predecessor companies, key personnel and subcontractors for which past performance will be evaluated. To determine how well the offeror has performed in the past, the Government will contact sources and ask them to rate the offeror in the areas identified below. Offerors will have an opportunity to respond to adverse past performance information for which they have not previously had an opportunity to respond. The rating scheme is identical to the rating scheme used in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). If past performance information on the contract has already been entered into PPIRS those ratings will be used. The following performance areas will be rated: Quality of Product/Service ­ Contractor's conformance to contract/order requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g., commonly accepted technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). Schedule ­ The timeliness of the contractor against the completition of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance). Cost Control ­ Contractor's effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract/order cost. Business Relations ­Integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract/order, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, proposal submittals, the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior (to include timely identification of issues in controversy), customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts.

Management of Key Personnel (Applicable when the contract/order contains a Key Personnel clause) ­ Contractor's performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel. Utilization of Small Business ­ Whether the contractor provided maximum practicable opportunity for Small Businesses to participate in contract/order performance consistent with efficient performance of the contract/order. Including compliance with all terms and conditions in the contract/order relating to Small Business participation, small business participation goals, and AbilityOne goals (when required). Performance Ratings The Federal Government uses the Contractor Performance Assessment System (CPARS) to document contractor performance information that is required by Federal Regulations. Past performance information entered to CPARS is available to Federal agencies through a separate system called the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for source selection purposes. To determine how well the offeror has performed in the past, the Government is using past performance rating information available in PPIRS as well as information provided through questionnaires and direct communication with references. PERFORMANCE RATING EVALUATION SCHEME: Rating Exceptional Definition Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective. Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective. Performance meets contractual requirements. The element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory. Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The element being assessed contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.

Very Good

Satisfactory Marginal

Unsatisfactory

Offerors will have an opportunity to respond to adverse past performance information for which they have not previously had an opportunity to respond.

Solicitation No. 14-233-SOL-00087 Support for AHRQ Quality Indicators IV

Relevancy Relevancy will be evaluated based on the size, scope and complexity of the offeror's past performance and how it compares to the services specified in Section B of this RFP. As the relevancy of past performance increases the significance of the reference also increases. Rating Very Relevant Relevant Not Relevant Definition The size, scope and complexity of the offeror's past performance compares very closely to the services specified in Section B of the RFP. The size, scope and complexity of the offeror's past performance compares somewhat to the services specified in Section B of the RFP. The size, scope and complexity of the offeror's past performance does not compare to the services specified in Section B of the RFP.

Confidence Level The past performance information gathered will be used to determine, overall, a confidence level for each offeror. The confidence level will be based on a combination of how well the offeror has performed in the past and the relevancy of the work performed. The Government will consider the work to be performed by the offeror, subcontractors, key personnel and other relevant parties to determine the significance of their particular past performance information when determining the confidence level. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. CONFIDENCE LEVEL EVALUATION SCHEME: Confidence Level Very Low Risk Low Performance Risk Moderate Performance Risk High Performance Risk Very High Performance Risk Unknown Performance Risk Definition Risk Based on the offeror's performance record, no doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No performance record is identifiable.

Offerors will have an opportunity to respond to adverse past performance information for which they have not previously had an opportunity to respond.

M.4.9 Factor ­ 9 Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan

5 points

The Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) participation plan will be evaluated on those offers determined to be technically acceptable, based on the offeror's technical proposal and the evaluation criteria listed in Section M. The Government reserves the right to evaluate SDB participation plans for technically unacceptable offerors if it is determined to be in the Government's best interest. In order to be evaluated favorably the SDB must be an SDB under NAICS industry subsector for the tasks that the SDB is being proposed to accomplish. In order for a SDB submitting a proposal as a prime to get these points, it must also provide a Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Plan. Offerors will be evaluated subjectively on the following sub-factors:  The extent of an Offeror's commitment to use SDB concerns o Commitments should be as specific as possible, i.e. are subcontract arrangements already in place, letters of commitment, etc. Specific SDB concerns must be identified with points of contact and phone numbers. Enforceable commitments will be weighed more heavily than nonenforceable ones. The extent of participation of all SDB concerns in terms of the value of the total acquisition must be identified. The extent to which minimum target goals (as indicated in Section L.5.5) will be met will be considered. Offerors will be given greater credit for targets exceeding the minimum target specified for this requirement, as long as the targets are realistic. Targets expressed as dollars and percentage of total contract value for each SDB participating will be incorporated into and become part of any resulting contract. The complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform o Greater weight will be given for arrangements where the SDB shall be performing a greater variety of work, and work of greater complexity. Past performance of the Offeror in complying with sub-contracting plans for SDB Concerns and monetary targets for SDB participation.





An Offeror with an exceptional record of participation with SDB concerns will receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable. The SDB Participation Plan is separate from the Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

M.5 SUBCONTRACTING PLAN ­ RATED ACCEPTABLE/NON-ACCEPTABLE The Subcontracting Plan will be evaluated on an acceptable/not acceptable basis. Proposals that are not acceptable under this factor are not eligible for award. This does not apply to small businesses under the selected NAICS code. An acceptable plan must, in the determination of the Contracting Officer, provide the maximum opportunity for small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons to participate in the performance of the contract. If the apparently successful offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the contracting officer within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the offeror will be ineligible for award. M.6 COST EVALUATION Estimated cost is not a numerical factor and will receive less consideration than the non-cost factors when combined. Although estimated cost will not be point scored, it is important and its importance as an evaluation factor could increase as competing proposals become more equal in terms of the non-cost factors. The proposal costs will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism which is defined as the Offeror's ability to project costs which are realistic for the work to be performed, indicates tht the Offeror understands the nature and extent of the work to be performed, and is consistent with the various elements of the Offeror's technical proposal. M.7 FAR 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (Jul 1990) Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). M.8 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST

If the Government determines that an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) exists, that cannot be satisfactorily avoided, neutralized or mitigated or waived, the Contracting Officer may determine that the offeror will not be eligible for award. The Government reserves the right to only consider mitigation plans proposed by the apparent successful offeror. If this acquisition is governed by FAR Part 15, the process of approving an OCI mitigation plan and revisions to such a plan does not constitute discussions as described in FAR 15.306. M.9 RESPONSIBILITY

To be eligible for award, an Offeror must be determined responsible in accordance with the standards in FAR Part 9.104.

Appendix 5: Deliverables for AHRQ Application and System Development Requirements



The following table identifies the documentation deliverables required for all IT projects and the content required for each deliverable.



Table 1.1 – Documentation Deliverables



System Documentation 



The Contractor will provide to the Agency system documentation of all proposed hardware, software, security, backup/recovery, and other information technology infrastructure and components and solutions needed to support this project.  The documentation is to be delivered to the Project Officer for review and approval for each release.  This documentation will be provided according to the content standards specified by AHRQ and will be maintained in the Agency’s Rational ClearCase Repository as a unique project library created and maintained by the AHRQ CM Manager.  All documentation will be baselined with each system release. In addition, the source code for each production release will be delivered and stored in the same project library as the documentation artifacts. The contractor will be required to update these baselined artifacts for each production release of the system.  Sample documents and templates for the required documentation artifacts are available as guidance.  The following documents as mentioned in Table 1.1, “Documentation Deliverables”, are required by AHRQ. 



Project Initiation Document 



The Project Initiation Document (PID) is intended to be a statement of purpose and scope for initiating a given project and a guide to manage expectations in both process and deliverables throughout the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  The PID defines the business case for the project by defining the purpose, the milestones, resources, objectives, costs, risks including mitigation strategies, and the artifacts and IT technologies (architecture) utilized and produced for, and during, the project. The PID serves as the formal funding commitment document approved by the COR and Stakeholders.  Additionally, the PID must be approved by AHRQ IT management, and in some cases, the AHRQ Information Technology Review Board (ITRB) for technical viability, adherence to Agency Enterprise Architecture (EA); technical standards and formal Project Management requirements as derived from Departmental standards and accepted Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) standards.  In the case of external development contracts, the PID can be satisfied by the formal proposal submitted by the vendor and accepted by AHRQ.  



Project Work Plan



The System Project Plan or Project Work Plan (PWP) provides a method to assign and track the project resources, hours and specific deliverables. This plan provides the detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and resource loading that can be used to identify project costs and is intended for the project manager to track the schedule and cost of a project, including development of Earned Value Management (EVM) measures. The PWP is delineated by the phases of the project which include Project Initiation, Generation of the PWP Schedule, Requirements Gathering, System Design, System Development, System Testing including User Acceptance, System Deployment and System Support and production of project deliverables which require COR or Stakeholder acceptance and signoff to continue project tasks identified in the PWP.  



System Requirements Document



The System Requirements Document (SRD) contains the system requirements, use cases and supplementary specifications that provide the basis for design and development of the system.  The following information is provided for each requirement identified in the document:



Requirement ID, Name and Title

Requirement Description

Software Release Version

Use Case Model

Use Case Specifications

Supplementary Specifications



A text-based Functional Requirements Document may be provided instead of a Use Case Model, Use Case Specifications, and Supplementary Specifications.



Requirements Traceability Matrix



The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) associates requirements with the work products that satisfy them.  This matrix is created at the beginning of a project’s lifecycle to trace the requirements from identification through testing.  The project elements are traced as they relate to other project elements, especially those related to requirements.  



The purpose of establishing traceability is to help understand the sources of requirements, manage the scope of the project, manage changes to requirements; assess the project impact of a change in a requirement; and verify that all requirements of the system are fulfilled by the implementation.  



The following values are required for the traceability matrix:



Requirement ID and Title;

The version of the system in which the requirement will be implemented;

The Use Case to which the requirement can be traced;

The version of the design document in which the requirement is implemented;

The ID of the test script in which the requirement is tested; 

The version number of the source code in which the requirement is implemented.




The figure below shows a sample of the data traced through a project’s life cycle.







System Design Document



The System Design Document (SDD) details the design and implementation of all custom software features of the system. The design descriptions must include use cases that detail the interaction which occurs between a user and the system.  



The document describes the general nature of the system, and describes the architecturally significant parts of the design model, such as its decomposition into subsystems and packages.  For each significant package, a section of the document should detail its decomposition into classes and class utilities.  Architecturally significant classes should be introduced and a description of their responsibilities should accompany the introduction.  Any significant relationships, operations, and attributes should be detailed in this document.



The document should be organized by use case, so that it provides traceability back to the initial requirements. The document must also contain a description of the database model and data elements used to support the application. This data can be referenced to an appropriately maintained Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and data definitions which conform to CM standards and are appropriately maintained in the Rational CM Libraries. 



Test Plan



The purpose of the Test Plan is to define the approach for testing a particular application or system.  The Test Plan is a high level description of the testing process which will be performed. The Test Plan outlines the types of testing to be performed, the requirements to be tested, the test environment, testing tools, pass/fail criteria and a risk assessment. At a minimum the document should contain the following:




Test Description 

A general overview of the plan for testing the entire system. 

Test objectives for all testing levels (e.g. module, unit). 

Scope and guiding principles for the testing effort. 

A policy for resolving conflicts that arise during the testing process. 

Acceptance Criteria 

The criteria agreed upon with the customer for acceptance of the software. 

Approach 

How each major group of software features will be adequately tested.

Major testing activities, techniques, and testing tools. 

Test Environment – Hardware, Network, Software and Test Database

Tasks

The individual tasks that must be performed. 

The individual or organization responsible for each task.

Schedule, Resources & Milestones 



Test Scripts



The Test Scripts define testing scenarios completed for an application.  Each scenario details the steps to be performed, expected results and pass/fail criteria.  At a minimum the document should contain the following:



Test Script Identifier 

Test Description 

Test Objective

Test Environment/Setup including any required data such as Login credentials, etc.

Mapping to specific requirements and design elements contained in the SRD and SDD 

Step sequences and actions

Expected Results

Pass/Fail Criteria

PART 2: GENERAL PERFORMANCE

Instructions: Please rate each of the following areas based on the evaluation scale included in Appendix A. Definitions for the performance areas to be rated are included in Appendix B.  Other evaluation areas that are unique to the contract or that cannot be captured elsewhere should be added to the table.  Lines 7-9 are in the table for this purpose, but additional lines can be added by references.  Space to include comments to support ratings is provided in the ‘Evaluator Comments’ section.  






Appendix A - PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS



The Federal Government uses the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to document contractor performance information that is required by Federal Regulations.  Past performance information entered to CPARS is available to Federal agencies through a separate system called the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for source selection purposes.  The ratings and definitions used in this questionnaire are identical to those used in CPARS.



Rating			Definition

Exceptional	Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.



Very Good	Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.



Satisfactory	Performance meets contractual requirements. The element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.



Marginal	Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions.



Unsatisfactory	Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The element being assessed contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.






Appendix B – PERFORMANCE AREA DEFINITIONS



The Federal Government uses the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to document contractor performance information that is required by Federal Regulations.  Past performance information entered to CPARS is available to Federal agencies through a separate system called the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for source selection purposes.  The performance areas and definitions used in this questionnaire are identical to those used in CPARS.



Quality of Product/Service – Assess the contractor’s conformance to contract/order requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g., commonly accepted technical, professional, environmental, or safety and health standards). For example:  Are reports/data accurate?  Does the product or service provided meet the specifications of the contract/order?  Does the Contractor’s work measure up to commonly accepted technical or professional standards?  Assess the degree of customer (Government or Commercial) technical direction required to solve problems that arise during performance.



For Operations Support: Assess how successfully the contractor meets program quality objectives such as ability to produce, reliability, maintainability and ability to inspect.  The evaluator must be flexible in how contractor success is measured; e.g., using data from field reliability and maintainability and failure reports, user comments, and acceptance rates, and scrap and rework rates.  Did the contractor demonstrate continuous improvement, quality and reliability leadership that reflects progress in quality management? 



Schedule – Assess the timeliness of the contractor against the competition of the contract, task orders, milestones, delivery schedules, and administrative requirements (e.g., efforts that contribute to or effect the schedule variance).

This evaluation of the contractor’s adherence to the required delivery schedule should include the contractor’s efforts during the evaluation period that contributes to or effects the schedule variance.  This element applies to contract/order closeout activities as well as contract performance.  Instances of adverse actions such as assessment of liquidated damages, or issuance of Cure Notices, Show Cause Notices, and Delinquency Notices are indicators of problems which may have resulted in variance to the contract/order schedule and should therefore be noted in the evaluation.



Cost Control (Not required for Firm Fixed Price or Firm Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment) – Assess the contractor’s effectiveness in forecasting, managing, and controlling contract/order cost. For example, does the contractor keep within the total estimated cost (what is the relationship of the negotiated costs and budgeted costs to actuals)?  Did the contractor do anything innovative that resulted in cost savings?  Were billings current, accurate and complete?  Are the contractor’s budgetary internal controls adequate?



Business Relations – Assess the integration and coordination of all activity needed to execute the contract/order, specifically the timeliness, completeness and quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, proposal submittals, the contractor’s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior (to include timely identification of issues in controversy), customer satisfaction, timely award and management of subcontracts.

Include, as applicable, information on the following:

Is the contractor oriented toward the customer?

Is interaction between the contractor and the customer satisfactory or does it need improvement?

Include the adequacy of the contractor’s accounting, billing, and estimating systems and the contractor’s management of customer property if a substantial amount of property has been provided to the contractor under the contract/order.

Address the timeliness of awards to subcontractors and management of subcontractors, including subcontract costs.  Consider efforts taken to ensure early identification of subcontract problems and the timely application of corporate resources to preclude subcontract problems from impacting overall prime contractor performance.

Assess the prime contractor’s effort devoted to managing subcontracts and whether subcontractors were an integral part of the contractor’s team.



Management of key Personnel (Applicable when the contract/order contains a Key Personnel clause) – Assess the contractor’s performance in selecting, retaining, supporting, and replacing, when necessary, key personnel.

For example, how well did the contractor match the qualifications of the key position, as described in the contract/order, with the person who filled the key position/  Di the contractor support key personnel so they were able to work effectively ?  If a key person did not perform well, what action was taken by the contractor to correct this?  If a replacement of a key person was necessary, did the replacement meet or exceed the qualifications of the position as described in the contract/order schedule?



Utilization of Small Business (Applicable only to Government contracts with small business clauses) – FAR subpart 19.7 and 15 U.S.C. 637 contain statutory requirements for complying with the Small Business subcontracting Program.  Assess whether the Contractor provided maximum practicable opportunity for Small Businesses to participate in contract/order performance consistent with efficient performance of the contract/order.

Assess compliance with all terms and conditions in the contract/order relating to Small Business participation (including FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small businesses and FAR 52.219-9, small b=business Subcontracting Plan (when required)).  Assess any Small Business participation goals, to include AbilityOne goals, which are stated separately in the contract/order.  Assess achievement on each individual goal stated within the contract/order of subcontracting plan including good faith effort if the goal was not achieved.
