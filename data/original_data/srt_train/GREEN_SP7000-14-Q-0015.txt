Summary
Column one includes all the Sections of the Standard that may apply to any deliverable. The total number of provisions within each Section of the Standard is shown in parentheses.  Column two identifies the total number of provisions that typically apply to a deliverable of this type. Some of these may not be features of the vendor's deliverable. Conversely, others not noted may be features of the vendor's deliverable. If the deliverable includes additional features, the accessibility of these features must also be considered.  Column three is for general notes about the Sections of the Standard. Some apply to all deliverables and some are specific to the deliverable.  Column four is a summary of the vendor's response to applicable provisions and additional deliverable features from the Sections of the Standard.  Column five is where the vendor can note explanations for any of the preceding columns, e.g. there are differences between expected applicable provisions and actual product features.

Enclosure 3                AIR FORCE Requirement 

  11.2.4.3:  Connecting Hardware to a Network/Enclave Guide  Getting devices connected to the AFGIG still requires a local security review by the  Information Assurance Manager (IAM) and documentation of the change added to the  specific enclave C&A packages prior to network connection.      DIACAP and Air Force process:     Any change to a system (to include enclaves) must be reviewed by the IAM (IAWDODI  8510.01).   References: DODI 8510.01, November 28, 2007    The DOD IS IAM has primary responsibility for maintaining situational awareness and  initiating actions to improve or restore IA posture.     The IAM continuously monitors the system or information environment for security  relevant events and configuration changes that negatively impact IA posture and  periodically assesses the quality of IA controls implementation against performance  indicators such as security incidents, feedback from external inspection agencies (e.g.,  IG DOD, Government Accountability Office (GAO)), exercises, and operational  evaluations. In addition the IAM may, independently or at the direction of the CA or  DAA, schedule a revalidation of any or all IA controls at any time.     The IAM shall annually provide a written or DOD PKIcertified digitally signed statement  to the DAA and the CA that indicates the results of the security review of all IA controls  and the testing of selected IA controls as required by Reference (a). The review will  either confirm the effectiveness of assigned IA controls and their implementation, or it  will recommend: changes such as those described in subparagraph 6.3.4.2.; a change in  accreditation status (e.g., accreditation status is downgraded to IATO or DATO); or  development of an IT Security POA&M. The CA and DAA shall review the IAM statement  in light of mission and information environment indicators and determine a course of  action that will be provided to the concerned CIO or SIAO for reporting requirements  described in Reference (a). The date of the annual security review will be recorded in the  SIP. A DAA may downgrade or revoke an accreditation decision at any time if risk  conditions or concerns so warrant.       The IAM must assess the change to determine if any change in the security posture of  the system has occurred. If the change negatively impacted the security posture the  IAM must initiate the reaccreditation process for the system (or enclave).      If the change does not negatively impact the security posture the IAM must document  the change and state that there is no effect on the security posture and sign a letter  attesting to that fact.  This letter or communication must be included in the current  C&A package and be made available to the AFDAA and the AFCA for informational  purposes.        DODI 8510.01 the IAM shall annually provide a written or DOD PKIcertified digitally  signed statement to the DAA and the CA that indicates the results of the security  review.

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
   

1. PURPOSE
 

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and applied document used to make sure that systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) standards that will be included in the contract. The intent is to ensure that the Contractor performs in accordance with performance metrics set forth in the contract documents, that the Government receives the quality of services called for in the contract and that the Government only pays for the acceptable level of services received.
 

2. AUTHORITY
 

Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under FAR 52.212-4(a), Inspection/Acceptance, and FAR 52.212-4(m), Termination for Cause, and documentation called for in the contract to be accomplished by the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative.
 

3. SCOPE
 

The QASP is put in place to provide Government surveillance oversight of the Contractor's quality control efforts to assure that they are timely, effective and are delivering the results specified in the contract. The QASP is not a part of the contract nor is it intended to duplicate the Contractor's Management Plan.
 

4. GOVERNMENT RESOURCES
 

The following definitions for Government resources are applicable to this plan:   Contracting Officer ­ A person duly appointed with the authority to enter into, administer, or terminate contracts and make related determination and findings on behalf of the Government.
 

Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) ­ An individual designated in writing by the Contracting Officer to act as his authorized representative to assist in administering a contract. The source and authority for a COR is the Contracting Officer. COR limitations are contained in the written letter of appointment.
 

5. RESPONSIBILITIES
 

The Government resources shall have responsibilities for the implementation of this QASP as follows:

Attachment 3 ­ QASP 

SP700014Q0015 

Contracting Officer ­ The Contracting Officer ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract and safeguards the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship. It is the Contracting Officer that assures the Contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under the contract. The Contracting Officer is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor's performance.
 

Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) ­ The COR is responsible for administration of the contract and assures proper Government surveillance of the Contractor's performance. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the Contractor deems may affect contract, price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action.
 

6. METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE
 

Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) Requirements:   (a) The Contractor, in performing this contract, will be subject to past performance assessment in accordance with FAR 42.15 and the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) Guide at: http://www.cpars.navy.mil/cparsfiles/pdfs/navycparsmanual/pdf. All information contained in the assessment may be used by the Government, within the limitations of FAR 42.15, for future source selections in accordance with FAR 15.304 where past performance is an evaluation factor. Assessments will be conducted as prescribed by CPARS guidance.
 

(b) The contractor will be provided with a copy of the assessment. The contractor will have 30 calendar days to submit comments, additional information, or rebut statements if warranted or desired. The contractor must strictly control access to the assessment while in the contractor's possession and must ensure that the assessment is never released to persons or entities outside of the contractor's control. After receipt of Contractor's comments or expiration of the 30 day comment period, whichever occurs first, and depending on the Contractor's response, the Government will:
 

(i) If no comments are received; close the CPARS by the assessing official rep and Reviewing Official.   (ii) If Contractor concurs with the assessment; accept/update and close the CPARS and forward comments to all reviewers.   (iii) If Contractor does not concur with the assessment, coordinate a final

SP700014Q0015 

response with Reviewing Official, Assessing Official Representative, and Assessing Official. (iv) Enter the final Government response and close CPARS.   (c) After completion of one of the appropriate actions, the Assessing Official will notify all individuals that the report is complete. The assessment is considered complete when signed by the Assessing or Reviewing Official.
 

(d) The official responsible for the corporate operating unit being assessed can submit a written request to receive a copy of the completed CPARS assessment. The assessment is not subject to the Disputes clause of the contract, nor is it subject to appeal beyond the review and comment procedures described above and in the CPARS Guide. Refer to: http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/ for details and additional information related to CPARS, CPARS user access (which includes obtaining a PKI certificate), how contract performance assessments are conducted, and how Contractors participate.
