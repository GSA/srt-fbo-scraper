Statement of Work:

1.0   BACKGROUND
FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices and
eliminating unnecessary human exposure to man-made radiation from medical, occupational and consumer products. There are thousands of types of
medical devices, from heart pacemakers to contact lenses. Radiation-emitting products regulated by FDA include microwave ovens, video display
terminals, and medical ultrasound and x-ray machines. The center accomplishes its mission by:
    • reviewing requests to research or market medical devices
    • collecting, analyzing, and acting on information about injuries and other experiences in the use of medical devices and radiation-emitting
      electronic products
    • setting and enforcing good manufacturing practice regulations and performance standards for radiation-emitting electronic products and
      medical devices
    • monitoring compliance and surveillance programs for medical devices and radiation-emitting electronic products
    • providing technical and other nonfinancial assistance to small manufacturers of medical devices.
CDRH is taking steps to increase its ability to identify, analyze, and act on postmarket information in order to improve the safety and
effectiveness of medical devices and radiation-emitting products. In January, 2006 the Center convened a senior leadership team (the Postmarket
Transformation Leadership Team-PTLT) which included external medical device experts.  The team’s charge was to "evaluate the recommendations in
the CDRH document, “Ensuring the Safety of Marketed Medical Devices – Executive Synopsis and Recommendations,” (January ’06), collect additional
data as necessary, supplement the recommendations, if needed, and propose a prioritized implementation plan for a transformed postmarket
process".

The report recommendations elaborated the four areas designated for improvement in the previous postmarket reports.  They are:

    • Create a Culture of Collaboration
    • Develop World Class Data Systems
    • Enhance Risk/Benefit Communication Efforts
    • Collaborate on Enforcement Strategies and Outcomes


1.1   Create a Culture of Collaboration
The Center’s goal in creating a culture of collaboration is to operate CDRH as a coordinated whole, rather than a collection of pieces.  The
Center is transforming its operations by adding a permanent matrix of cross-cutting product-related groups over the current functionally-based
organizational structure to foster information sharing, collaboration and, ultimately, more effective public health promotion and protection.
The cross-cutting matrix is designed to ensure that collaboration occurs not just in crisis situations, but also as a part of routine, day-to-
day operations.
Additionally, the Center must ensure that everyone understands the value and meaning of true collaboration.  We are establishing an
organizational culture in which it is expected that communication is open and honest, that all key stakeholders are consulted early in a
decision so that the right decision can be made the first time, and that people are empowered to lead effectively and efficiently.  A matrix
structure that overlays “horizontal” product-focused Networks over our “vertical” regulatory Office systems can, with strong leadership,
facilitate our transformation to a collaborative organization. 
The matrix overlay and the establishment and fostering of an organizational culture that encourages collaboration, and engagement of
stakeholders; subject matter experts; and others with relevant experience are key initiatives of postmarket transformation.  However, these
initiatives depend on a supporting technology environment that enables, among other things, the flow of information, the identification of
expertise, social (professional) networking, the ability to connect disparate information sources and “findability”.  Such an environment does
not currently exist at FDA/CDRH, and it is this environment that is the focus of the scope section below.
CDRH is looking for capabilities in two broad areas, and this statement of work covers one of those – social bookmarking/tagging and expertise
identification.


2.0   Scope
CDRH is seeking a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) social bookmarking/tagging and expertise identification application as one of the key enablers
for its matrix structure and in support of developing a culture of collaboration.  The actual software is a very small, but critical piece, of
these efforts.  CDRH has identified the mandatory and desirable requirements of a social bookmarking/tagging and expertise identification
application that will be of the greatest value to the Center.  These are listed in the table in section 2.1.
2.1   Mandatory and Desirable Features – are there any compatibility requirements (as in what kind of platform the system needs to run on?  Or,
We would not want to buy s/w that we do not have the capability to run) or are there any security requirements for the software?  If this is
going to run on the network, are there any other requirements that a vendor would need to know?
