2.0   Task Order Title.  Data Management/Enterprise Data Warehouse/Business Intelligence (DMO/EDW/BI) Support Services.


3.0   Background.



The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), headquartered at Fort Lee, Virginia, operates a worldwide chain of commissaries providing groceries to
military personnel, retirees and their families in a safe and secure shopping environment. Authorized patrons purchase items at cost plus a five
(5)-percent surcharge, which covers the costs of building new commissaries and modernizing existing ones. Shoppers save an average of more than
30 percent on their purchases compared to commercial prices – savings worth about $3,400 annually for a family of four. A core military family
support element, and a valued part of military pay and benefits, commissaries contribute to family readiness, enhance the quality of life for
America’s military and their families, and help recruit and retain the best and brightest men and women to serve their country.


DeCA has deployed an Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) to support its worldwide operations for nearly 254 stores.  The EDW stores transaction
history from the Point of Sale (POS) transactions and primary business systems.  The EDW provides DeCA managers, from the store to the
headquarters level, an operational decision support capability that was developed using state-of-the-art technology incorporating commercially
available hardware and software.  As an integral part of DeCA’s enterprise architecture, the EDW continues to evolve as more user requirements
are identified.



DeCA has established a Data Management Office (DMO) within the Information Technology Directorate.  The DMO identifies technologies for metadata
management and data management, prepares data management strategies and policies, and proposes data governance processes. These actions will
facilitate DeCA achieving DoD Net-Centric compliance.  The keys to the DMO strategy require: a shared business vocabulary; metadata integration
and metadata sharing across enterprise integration technologies; a data quality firewall; and master data management.


An essential part of DeCA’s EDW architecture includes the tools and technologies required to turn data contained in the warehouse and other data
sources into meaningful information that can be used by business analysts and managers to make operational, analytical and strategic decisions.
In support of the EDW architecture DeCA has organized the Business Intelligence (BI) Branch within the Information Technology Directorate.  The
DeCA BI Branch’s mission is to develop, implement and promote the use and growth of business intelligence tools that empowers business decision
makers within DeCA with the ability to extract and correlate data from various cross-functional and external sources to provide accurate
management information upon which to base operational and strategic business decisions.

52.239-9001  DATA INFORMATION ASSURANCE PROTECTION  (JULY 2006)

(a) The contractor shall protect and safeguard sensitive Government Provided Information (GFI) and data from inadvertent disclosure, misuse,
display, theft, and unauthorized actions that would destroy or render the information unavailable for specific government use.  Should the
contractor, or one of his/her employees, make any inadvertent or any unauthorized disclosure(s) or willfully participate in activities that
result in detrimental harm to the protection and safeguarding of sensitive (GFI) and data, such actions may be considered to be a breach of this
contract and the terms of the Default clause may be invoked.  The contractor shall afford safeguarding consistent with the protection
requirements identified by the government until such time the government deems the information/data is no longer sensitive and provides
corresponding written notification to the contractor.

(b) All contractor and support contractor personnel with access to DISA and DOD Information Systems shall complete initial information assurance
awareness and annual refresher training in accordance with DOD Directive, 8570.1, IA Training, Certification, and Workforce Management.

(c) To support IA professionals, the DoD IA Portal (IA Support Environment (IASE)) provides DOD IA policy-training requirements and DoD
sponsored training.  The IA Portal is located at http://iase.disa.mil.  This site also provides access to DOD Directive 8500.1, Information
Assurance (IA), and DOD 8570.1-M, Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program.


                                                                 (End of clause)

252.237-7023
                                  DFARS 252.237-7023      CONTINUATION OF MISSION ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS (MAR 2010)
      (a) The Government has identified all or a portion of the Contractor services performed under this Contract as essential Contractor
      services in support of mission essential functions. The Contractor-provided services that have been determined to be essential Contractor
      services in support of mission-essential functions are listed in attachment 6,
Mission-Essential Contractor Services, dated __________.
      (b) The Contractor shall provide a written plan for continuing the performance of essential Contractor services identified in paragraph (a)
      this section during a crisis.
           (1) The Contractor shall identify in the plan the provisions made for the acquisition of essential personnel and resources, if
           necessary, for continuity of operations for up to 30 days or until normal operations can be resumed;
           (2) The plan must, at a minimum, address—
                 (i) Challenges associated with maintaining essential Contractor services during an extended event, such as a pandemic that
                 occurs in repeated waves;
                 (ii) The time lapse associated with the initiation of the acquisition of essential personnel and resources and their actual
                 availability on site;
                 (iii) The components, processes, and requirements for the identification, training, and preparedness of personnel who are
                 capable of relocating to alternate facilities or performing work from home;
                 (iv) Any established alert and notification procedures for mobilizing identified “essential Contractor service” personnel; and
                 (v) The approach for communicating expectations to Contractor employees regarding their roles and responsibilities during a
                 crisis.
           (3) The Contractor shall maintain and update its plan as necessary and adhere to its requirements throughout the Contract term. The
           Contractor shall not materially alter the plan without the Contracting Officer’s consent.
           (4) As directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall participate in training events, exercises, and drills associated
           with Government efforts to test the effectiveness of continuity of operations procedures and practices.
      (c) In the event the Contractor anticipates not being able to perform any of the essential Contractor services identified in paragraph (a)
      of this section during a crisis situation, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer or other designated representative as
      expeditiously as possible and use its best efforts to cooperate with the Government in the Government’s efforts to maintain the continuity
      of operations.
      (d) The Government reserves the right in such crisis situations to use Federal employees of other agencies or contract support from other
      Contractors or to enter into new contracts for essential Contractor services. Any new contracting efforts would be conducted in accordance
      with OFPP letter, “Emergency Acquisitions” May 2007 and FAR and DFARS Subparts 18 and 218, respectively, or any other subsequent emergency
      guidance issued.
      (e) Changes. The Contractor shall segregate and separately identify all costs incurred in continuing performance of essential services in a
      crisis situation. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of an increase or decrease in costs within ninety days after
      continued performance has been directed by the Contracting Officer, or within any additional period that the Contracting Officer approves
      in writing, but not later than the date of final payment under the contract. The Contractor’s notice shall include the Contractor’s
      proposal for an equitable adjustment and any data supporting the increase or decrease in the form prescribed by the Contracting Officer.
      The parties shall negotiate an equitable price adjustment to the contract price as soon as is practicable after receipt of the Contractor’s
      proposal.
      (f) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (f), in subcontracts for the essential services.
                                                                 (End of Clause)

operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size
standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling
or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In
determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of
employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements,
facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.

size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the
following:

novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to
include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts--

(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that
corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard
corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a
construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause
by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central
Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting
office in writing within the timeframes specified in paragraph (b) of this clause that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the
date of the validation or update.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is
not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code
applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office,
along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

The Contractor represents that it (  ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code 541512- assigned to contract number      .

(End of clause)



252.211-7007    Reporting of Government-Furnished Equipment in the DoD Item Unique Identification (IUID) Registry (NOV 2008)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

2D data matrix symbol means the 2-dimensional Data Matrix ECC 200 as specified by International Standards Organization/International
Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) Standard 16022: Information Technology--International Symbology Specification--Data Matrix.

Acquisition cost, for Government-furnished equipment, means the amount identified in the contract, or in the absence of such identification, the
item's fair market value.

Concatenated unique item identifier means--

(1) For items that are serialized within the enterprise identifier, the linking together of the unique identifier data elements in order of the
issuing agency code, enterprise identifier, and unique serial number within the enterprise identifier; e.g., the enterprise identifier along
with the contractor's property internal identification, i.e., tag number is recognized as the serial number; or

(2) For items that are serialized within the original part, lot, or batch number, the linking together of the unique identifier data elements in
order of the issuing agency code; enterprise identifier; original part, lot, or batch number; and serial number within the original part, lot,
or batch number.

Equipment means a tangible item that is functionally complete for its intended purpose, durable, nonexpendable, and needed for the performance
of a contract. Equipment is not intended for sale, and does not ordinarily lose its identity or become a component part of another article when
put into use.

Government-furnished equipment means an item of special tooling, special test equipment, or equipment, in the possession of, or directly
acquired by, the Government and subsequently furnished to the Contractor (including subcontractors and alternate locations) for the performance
of a contract.

Item means equipment, special tooling, or special test equipment, to include such equipment, special tooling, or special test equipment that is
designated as serially managed, mission essential, sensitive, or controlled inventory (if previously identified as such in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the contract).

Item unique identification (IUID) means a system of assigning, reporting, and marking DoD property with unique item identifiers that have
machine-readable data elements to distinguish an item from all other like and unlike items.

IUID Registry means the DoD data repository that receives input from both industry and Government sources and provides storage of, and access
to, data that identifies and describes tangible Government personal property.

Material means property that may be consumed or expended during the performance of a contract, component parts of a higher assembly, or items
that lose their individual identity through incorporation into an end item. Material does not include equipment, special tooling, or special
test equipment.

Reparable means an item, typically in unserviceable condition, furnished to the Contractor for maintenance, repair, modification, or overhaul.

Sensitive item means an item potentially dangerous to public safety or security if stolen, lost, or misplaced, or that shall be subject to
exceptional physical security, protection, control, and accountability. Examples include weapons, ammunition, explosives, controlled substances,
radioactive materials, hazardous materials or wastes, or precious metals.

Serially managed item means an item designated by DoD to be uniquely tracked, controlled, or managed in maintenance, repair, and/or supply
systems by means of its serial number.

Special test equipment means either single or multipurpose integrated test units engineered, designed, fabricated, or modified to accomplish
special purpose testing in performing a contract. It consists of items or assemblies of equipment including foundations and similar improvements
necessary for installing special test equipment, and standard or general purpose items or components that are interconnected and interdependent
so as to become a new functional entity for special testing purposes. Special test equipment does not include material, special tooling, real
property, or equipment items used for general testing purposes, or property that with relatively minor expense can be made suitable for general
purpose use.

Special tooling means jigs, dies, fixtures, molds, patterns, taps, gauges, and all components of these items, including foundations and similar
improvements necessary for installing special tooling, and which are of such a specialized nature that without substantial modification or
alteration their use is limited to the development or production of particular supplies or parts thereof or to the performance of particular
services. Special tooling does not include material, special test equipment, real property, equipment, machine tools, or similar capital items.

Unique item identifier (UII) means a set of data elements permanently marked on an item that is globally unique and unambiguous and never
changes, in order to provide traceability of the item throughout its total life cycle. The term includes a concatenated UII or a DoD recognized
unique identification equivalent.

Virtual UII means the UII data elements assigned to an item that is not marked with a DoD compliant 2D data matrix symbol, e.g., enterprise
identifier, part number, and serial number; or the enterprise identifier along with the Contractor's property internal identification, i.e., tag
number.

(b) Requirement for item unique identification of Government-furnished equipment. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause--

(1) Contractor accountability and management of Government-furnished equipment shall be performed at the item level; and

(2) Unless provided by the Government, the Contractor shall establish a virtual UII or a DoD recognized unique identification for items that are-
-

(i) Valued at $5,000 or more in unit acquisition cost; or

(ii) Valued at less than $5,000 in unit acquisition cost and are serially managed, mission essential, sensitive, or controlled inventory, as
identified in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.

(c) Exceptions. Paragraph (b) of this clause does not apply to--

(1) Government-furnished material;

(2) Reparables;

(3) Contractor-acquired property;

(4) Property under any statutory leasing authority;

(5) Property to which the Government has acquired a lien or title solely because of partial, advance, progress, or performance-based payments;

(6) Intellectual property or software; or

(7) Real property.

(d) Procedures for establishing UIIs. To permit reporting of virtual UIIs to the DoD IUID Registry, the Contractor's property management system
shall enable the following data elements in addition to those required by paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of the Government Property clause of this
contract (FAR 52.245-1):

(1) Parent UII.

(2) Concatenated UII.

(3) Received/Sent (shipped) date.

(4) Status code.

(5) Current part number (if different from the original part number).

(6) Current part number effective date.

(7) Category code (``E'' for equipment).

(8) Contract number.

(9) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.

(10) Mark record.

(i) Bagged or tagged code (for items too small to individually tag or mark).

(ii) Contents (the type of information recorded on the item, e.g., item internal control number).

(iii) Effective date (date the mark is applied).

(iv) Added or removed code/flag.

(v) Marker code (designates which code is used in the marker identifier, e.g., D=CAGE, UN=DUNS, LD=DODAAC).

(vi) Marker identifier, e.g., Contractor's CAGE code or DUNS number.

(vii) Medium code; how the data is recorded, e.g., barcode, contact memory button.

(viii) Value, e.g., actual text or data string that is recorded in its human readable form.

(ix) Set (used to group marks when multiple sets exist); for the purpose of this clause, this defaults to ``one (1)''.

(e) Procedures for updating the DoD IUID Registry. The Contractor shall update the DoD IUID Registry at https://www.bpn.gov/iuid for changes in
status, mark, custody, or disposition of items--

(1) Delivered or shipped from the Contractor's plant, under Government instructions, except when shipment is to a subcontractor or other
location of the Contractor;

(2) Consumed or expended, reasonably and properly, or otherwise accounted for, in the performance of the contract as determined by the
Government property administrator, including reasonable inventory adjustments;

(3) Disposed of; or

(4) Transferred to a follow-on or other contract.

2.0  Task Order Title.  Data Management Office, Enterprise Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence Support

3.0   Background.   The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), headquartered at Fort Lee, Virginia, operates a worldwide chain of commissaries
providing groceries to military personnel, retirees and their families in a safe and secure shopping environment. Authorized patrons purchase
items at cost plus a five (5)-percent surcharge, which covers the costs of building new commissaries and modernizing existing ones. Shoppers
save an average of more than 30 percent on their purchases compared to commercial prices – savings worth about $3,400 annually for a family of
four. A core military family support element, and a valued part of military pay and benefits, commissaries contribute to family readiness,
enhance the quality of life for America’s military and their families, and help recruit and retain the best and brightest men and women to serve
their country.


DeCA has deployed an Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) to support its worldwide operations for nearly 254 stores.  The EDW stores transaction
history from the Point of Sale (POS) transactions and primary business systems.  The EDW provides DeCA managers, from the store to the
headquarters level, an operational decision support capability that was developed using state-of-the-art technology incorporating commercially
available hardware and software.  As an integral part of DeCA’s enterprise architecture, the EDW continues to evolve as more user requirements
are identified.



DeCA has established a Data Management Office (DMO) within the Information Technology Directorate.  The DMO identifies technologies for metadata
management and data management, prepares data management strategies and policies, and proposes data governance processes. These actions will
facilitate DeCA achieving DoD Net-Centric compliance.  The keys to the DMO strategy require: a shared business vocabulary; metadata integration
and metadata sharing across enterprise integration technologies; a data quality firewall; and master data management.


An essential part of DeCA’s EDW architecture includes the tools and technologies required to turn data contained in the warehouse and other data
sources into meaningful information that can be used by business analysts and managers to make operational, analytical and strategic decisions.
In support of the EDW architecture DeCA has organized the Business Intelligence (BI) Branch within the Information Technology Directorate.  The
DeCA BI Branch’s mission is to develop, implement and promote the use and growth of business intelligence tools that empowers business decision
makers within DeCA with the ability to extract and correlate data from various cross-functional and external sources to provide accurate
management information upon which to base operational and strategic business decisions.


4.0  Objectives.  This Task order (T.O.) supports DeCA in meeting operational and information technology objectives of the DMO/EDW/BI program.
This effort represents a continuation of system life cycle support services for the DeCA’s EDW and DMO.  In addition, the contractor shall
conduct business studies and assessments in support of the array of DeCA programs that interface with the EDW and/or DMO through the BI Branch.
All efforts shall comply with DoD and DeCA directives, regulations, and policies applicable to development, modification, and sustainment of
information systems.

Data interfaces shall be developed by the contractor using Net-Centric attributes and shall be tested for interoperability in accordance with
the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA).  Data shall be developed and stored in a DeCA supported relational database and centralized on
Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or higher, Oracle 10.3 or higher and Teradata v12 or higher.   The contractor shall employ industry best practices of
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) standards and DoD Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES).

DeCA data management governance processes, standards and tools shall be included in all development methods used by the contractor for work
performed under this contract, including application System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as well as in business processes to ensure data
consistency across business processes, enabling applications and organizations.  Standards relating to information exchanges, information
assurance, change management, data and metadata management, data quality, data modeling procedures, enterprise data model and architecture and
data management tools shall be utilized.

5.0  Scope.   The contractor shall provide all necessary personnel, project management, business and data analysis, data management, Information
Assurance and non-personal technical services for system life cycle support services for the Defense Commissary Agency’s (DeCA) Data Management
Office (DMO), Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) and Business Intelligence (BI) Branch.

      6.10  Phase-In


        6.10.1   Phase-In Period.


        The Government has designated a phase-in period of sixty (60) days within the basic period of performance of the contract.  The phase-in
        period, if required, and with the assistance of the incumbent contractor, shall provide time for contractors to ramp up, become familiar
        with the current DMO/EDW/BI system baselines and the related technical environments and provide time for an audit of the current
        baselines before turnover to the new contractor.




        6.10.2   Initial Phase-In Plan


        The contractor shall provide an initial Phase-In plan with their proposal describing how the contractor proposes to become familiar with
        the DMO/EDW/BI requirements and assume full responsibility under this PWS.  The offeror shall present a responsive,  realistic  plan  to
        ramp up with the appropriate technical expertise including key personnel during the Phase-In period.  The offeror shall present a clear,
        reasoned approach to assuming responsibility for any on-going tasks and completing the transition to full contract responsibility by the
        conclusion of the Phase-In period not later than 60 days after contract award.  The Phase-In Plan shall:

                 (a) Present a realistic, responsive Integrated Management Schedule (milestone schedule), a Work Breakdown  Structure  (WBS)  and
                 Integrated Management Plan detailing the ramp up with the appropriate technical expertise including  key  personnel  during  the
                 Phase-In period.  The milestone schedule shall include the deliverables described in the PWS, Paragraph 11.0.


                 (b)  Identify the major risks associated with the transition to  include  assuming  responsibility  for  any  on-going  software
                 development tasks and describe appropriate strategies to mitigate these risks.  Specifically address the  risks  and  mitigation
                 associated with obtaining the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment  and  meeting  the  requirement  to  fully  assume  all
                 responsibilities at the end of the Phase-In period (not to exceed 60 days after contract award).


         6.10.3   Core Group of Personnel


         The Contractor shall identify and provide the core group of personnel for the Phase-In period.  The Government requires these  personnel
         to be located locally on-site (at DeCA Headquarters) during the Phase-In period.


      4. Revised Phase-In Plan


         An updated Phase-In Plan shall be provided after contract award.  The contractor shall:


 ▪ Refine the Phase-in Plan and identify detail tasks and milestones to be accomplished
 ▪ Become familiar with DeCA key personnel, systems, and processes
 ▪ Create and deliver the:
1. Software Quality Assurance Plan, PWS para. 6.13
2. Configuration Management Plan, PWS para. 6.9


         6.10.5   Formal Turnover


         The final portion of the phase-in period will be used to freeze the existing baseline, conduct a joint audit of the  baseline  with  the
         Government, and conduct a formal turnover of the application baseline to the contractor by the Government.

____________________________________________________________________________________

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.35 per hour or $134.00 per week or $580.66 per month

VACATION: 1 week paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 2 weeks after 2 years; 3 weeks after 5 years; and 4 weeks after 15 years.
 Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present
contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in
the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther
King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor
Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A
contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in
accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does
not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,
administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because
most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate
not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per
week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.
400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations
within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not
list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey
data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds
$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For
example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties
within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer
occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,
then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the
conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage
determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.
  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations
involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.
gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at
http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

1.  Task Order Title:  Data Management/Enterprise Data Warehouse/Business Intelligence (DMO/EDW/BI) Support Services

2.  Work Requirements:

 • Task 1.  Project Management

 • Task 2.  Operational Support

 • Task 3.  Security / Information Assurance

 • Task 4.  Disaster Recovery

 • Task 5.  Data Management, Data Modeling, Metadata Management and Requirements Validation

 • Task 6.  Design and Development of Enterprise Data Interfaces and Business Intelligence Solutions and Reports

 • Task 7.  Business Intelligence User Support

 • Task 8.  Technical Documentation, Studies and Assessments

 • Task 9.  DMO/EDW/BI Configuration Management


3.  Primary Method of Surveillance:


   Acceptable surveillance methods include:

    ✓ 100 Percent Inspection.  This is usually only the most appropriate method for infrequent tasks or tasks with stringent performance
      requirements, e.g., where safety or health is a concern.  With this method, performance is inspected/evaluated at each occurrence. One
      hundred percent inspection is too expensive to be used in most cases.

    ✓ Random Sampling.  This is usually the most appropriate method for recurring tasks.  With random sampling, services are sampled to
      determine if the level of performance is acceptable.  Random sampling works best when the number of instances of the services being
      performed is very large and a statistically valid sample can be obtained.  Computer programs may be available to assist in establishing
      sampling procedures.

    ✓ Periodic Inspection: These services are monitored weekly, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually, etc. Periodic types of activities
      are perfect for periodic inspection because not only are they infrequent, but there is normally a predetermined, specified time frame
      within which the tasks must be accomplished. Therefore, you know exactly when to conduct the evaluations. Periodic inspections
      automatically become 100 percent evaluations or "100 percent checks." Inspections should be divided and scheduled by frequency: annual,
      semiannual, quarterly, monthly, weekly and as required. Sometimes services are required for which the time or frequency cannot be
      predicted, such as accident investigations, one-time special tasking by higher headquarters, etc. These would be labeled "as required
      inspections." Others are known and predictable such as the quarterly status report or the monthly travel report currently included in some
      DISA service contracts.

    ✓ Customer Input.  Although usually not a primary method, this is a valuable supplement to more systematic methods.  For example, in a case
      where random sampling indicates unsatisfactory service, customer complaints can be used as substantiating evidence. In certain situations
      where customers can be relied upon to complain consistently when the quality of performance is poor, e.g., dining facilities, building
      services, customer surveys and customer complaints may be a primary surveillance method, and customer satisfaction an appropriate
      performance standard.  In all cases, complaints should be documented, preferably on a standard form.

accordance with these instructions.  The offer shall be compliant with the requirements as stated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), and
the attached Task Order PWS requirement.  Non-conformance with the instructions provided in this Information to Offerors may result in an

provides the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.



      (b) The proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity
of stated claims.  The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements but rather shall provide convincing
rationale to address how the offeror intends to meet these requirements.  Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of

selection decision in accordance with FAR 15.506.  Upon such notification, unsuccessful offerors may request and receive a debriefing.  Offerors
desiring a debriefing must make their request in accordance with the requirements of FAR 15.505 or 15.506, as applicable.

the omission or error.  The offeror is reminded that the Government reserves the right to award this effort based on the initial proposal, as
received, without discussion.  This reservation includes matters of additional or substitute pages of the initial proposal.

* 20 pages total for the five (5) most relevant contracts



2.2.1 Page Limitations/Page Numbering
Page limitations shall be treated as maximums.  If exceeded, the excess pages will not be read or considered in the evaluation of the proposal
and excess paper copies will be returned to the offeror as soon as practicable.  Page limitations may be placed on responses to Evaluation
Notices (ENs).  The specified page limits for EN responses will be identified in the letters forwarding the ENs to the offerors.    Each page
shall be counted except the following:

Cover Page – Not included in page count
Table of Contents – Not included in page count
List of Tables/Drawings – Not included in page count

Page Numbering.  The offeror shall use a standard page numbering system to facilitate proposal references.  Consecutive page numbering within
sections is preferred, e.g., Page I-2-5, indicates part I, Section 2, page 5.  Charts, graphs and other insert materials shall be page-numbered
as part of the page numbering system.  Additional identification of such attachments is permissible.

2.2.2. Page Size and Format

A page is defined as each face of a sheet of paper containing information.  When both sides of a sheet display printed material, it shall be
counted as two pages.  Page size shall be 8.5 x 11 inches, not including foldouts.  Pages shall be single-spaced.   Except for the reproduced
sections of the solicitation document, the text shall be in Times New Roman font and be no less than 12 point.  Tracking, kerning, and leading
values shall not be changed from the default values of the word processing or page layout software.  Use at least 1-inch margins on the top and
bottom and ¾ inch side margins.  Pages shall be numbered sequentially by volume.  These page format restrictions shall apply to responses to
ENs.  These limitations shall apply to both electronic and hard copy proposals.

Legible tables, charts, graphs and figures shall be used wherever practical to depict organizations, systems and layout, implementation
schedules, plans, etc.  These displays shall be uncomplicated, legible, and shall not exceed 11 by 17 inches in size.  Foldout pages shall fold
entirely within the volume, and count as a single page.  Foldout pages may only be used for large tables, charts, graphs, diagrams and
schematics not for pages of text.  For tables, charts, graphs and figures, the test shall be in Arial font and be no less than 9 point.

Reference paragraph 6 for cost/price instructions.

NOTE:  Offerors are cautioned that submission of more data than required by the cost/price proposal instructions, Public Law, and/or FAR may
hinder the evaluation of the cost/price proposal.  Since the contract price is based on adequate price competition, the contracting Officer does
not anticipate a requirement for Certified Cost or Pricing Data.  However, offerors may be required to submit information other than cost or
pricing data in accordance with FAR 52.215-20/21.  The Contracting Officer will request this information as deemed necessary.

2.2.3  Cost or Pricing Information

All cost or pricing information shall be addressed ONLY in the Cost/Price proposal and Contract Documentation Volumes.  Cost trade-off
information, work-hour estimates, and material kinds and quantities may be used in other volumes only as appropriate for presenting rationale
for alternatives or design and trade-off decisions.


2.2.4 Cross-Referencing

To the greatest extent possible, each volume shall be written on a stand-alone basis so that its contents may be evaluated with a minimum of
cross referencing to other volumes of the proposal.  Information required for proposal evaluation which is not found in its designated volume
will be assumed to have been omitted from the proposal.  Cross-referencing within a proposal volume is permitted where its use would conserve
space without impairing clarity.  Cross-referencing between proposal volumes is not permitted.  The offeror shall provide a cross-reference
matrix indicating by RFP and PWS as applicable to the corresponding proposal paragraph which addresses the referenced item.

2.2.5 Glossary of Abbreviations and Acronyms
Each volume shall contain a glossary of all abbreviations and acronyms used, and with an explanation for each.  Glossaries do not count against

3.0  Volume I - Executive Summary

In the executive summary volume, the offeror shall provide the following information:


3.1  Narrative Summary

The narrative summary of the entire proposal should be concise, to include addressing the significant risks, and highlighting any key or unique
features, excluding cost/price.  The salient features should tie in with Section M evaluation factors/subfactors.  Any summary material
presented here shall not be considered as meeting the requirements for any portions of other volumes of the proposal.

3.2. Table of Contents
Include a master table of contents of the entire proposal.


4.0   Volume II – Technical/Management (Factor 1) Volume



4.1 General

The Technical/Management Volume should be specific and complete.  Legibility, clarity, and coherence are very important.  Your responses will be
evaluated against the Technical/ Management subfactors defined in Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award.  Using the instructions provided
below, provide as specifically as possible the actual methodology you would use for accomplishing/satisfying these subfactors.  All the
requirements specified in the solicitation are mandatory.  By your proposal submission, you are representing that your firm will perform all the
requirements specified in the solicitation. It is not necessary or desirable for you to tell us so in your proposal.  Do not merely reiterate
the objectives or reformulate the requirements specified in the solicitation.


4.2 Format and Specific Content



4.2.1 Technical/Management

In the Technical/Management volume, address your proposed approach to meeting or exceeding the minimum performance or capability requirements of
each technical/management subfactor, as well as the risks in your proposed approach in terms of technical performance, cost, and/or schedule.

Proposals shall describe the capability of your organization to perform this effort including pertinent aspects of the proposed approach
including teaming or subcontracting approaches.  The proposal should be prepared simply and economically, providing straightforward, concise
delineation of capabilities to perform satisfactorily the contract being sought.  The proposal shall not merely offer to perform work in
accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS), but shall outline the actual approach proposed as specifically as possible.  Particular
proposal strengths or unique approaches should be highlighted.  Repeating the requirements without sufficient elaboration will not be
acceptable.  Responses shall be outlined by Subfactors as defined in Section M of this solicitation and proposal elements shall be cross-indexed
to the evaluation criteria listed in Section M.  Offerors are responsible for ensuring the completeness of their proposal.  The evaluation team
for the Government has been instructed to evaluate on the basis of the information provided in the proposal.  The Government shall not assume
that an offeror possesses any capability unless specified in the proposal.

a.    Subfactor 1.1:   Technical Approach

Proposals shall demonstrate the offeror’s understanding of EDW-DMO-BI Support Services as it applies to DeCA’s requirements and the offeror’s
approach to accomplishing all tasks in this PWS and Task Order 0001, Attachment 5.

Note:  The Task Order 0001, Attachment 5,  referenced above will be awarded to the successful offeror at contract award.

b.    Subfactor 1.2:   Qualifications of Assigned Personnel

The offeror shall present their plan to recruit, train and assign personnel to the initial and subsequent task orders under this contract.
Offerors shall certify in their proposal that individuals proposed for each labor category possess the necessary knowledge, training, successful
experience and appropriate certifications to perform all of the duties of that position as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS
14.0.b).

Required certifications identified as such, in PWS and Sample Task Order, shall be a mandatory requirement of this effort.  Certifications
marked as desired, are optional for performance of this effort.  However, during evaluation of proposals, favorable consideration will be given
to offerors who propose labor categories with desired certifications.

c.    Subfactor 1.3:   Phase-In Plan
Provide a Phase-In plan that:


(1)   Includes a milestone schedule detailing the ramp up with the appropriate technical expertise including key personnel  during  the  Phase-In
period.

(2)   Presents the approach to assuming responsibility for any on-going tasks and completing the transition to full  contract  responsibility  by
the conclusion of the Phase-In period.

(3)   Identifies the major risks associated with the transition and describe strategies to mitigate these risks.  Specifically address the  risks
and mitigation associated with obtaining the necessary personnel,  facilities,  equipment  and  meeting  the  requirement  to  fully  assume  all
responsibilities at the end of the Phase-In period.


4.2.2 Technical/Management Risk

Address technical/management risk by identifying those aspects of the proposal you consider to have the potential for disruption of schedule,
increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and/or the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance.
Classify and provide the rationale for each risk and its rating, including quantitative estimates of the impact on cost, schedule, and
performance.  Describe the impact of each identified risk in terms of its potential to interfere with or prevent the successful accomplishment
of other contract requirements (e.g., PWS or specification requirements), whether or not those requirements are identified as subfactors.
Propose a realistic "work-around" or risk mitigators for identified risks that will eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level.  Identify
and classify any new risks introduced by such risk mitigation.

5.0   Volume III -- Past Performance (FACTOR 2)

5.1.  General

a.    Each offeror shall submit a past performance volume with its proposal, containing past performance information in accordance with the
format contained in Attachment  1.  This information is required on the offeror and all subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture
partners that are proposed to perform aspects of the effort you consider critical to overall successful performance.  Offerors are cautioned
that the Government will use data provided by each offeror in this volume and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past
performance.

Along with the information required in this paragraph, the offeror shall submit a consent letter executed by each subcontractor, teaming
partner, and/or joint venture partner, authorizing release of adverse past performance information to the offeror so the offeror can respond to
such information.  For each identified effort for a commercial customer, the offeror shall also submit a client authorization letter,
authorizing release to the Government of requested information on the offeror’s performance.  See Attachment 3 for Client Authorization Letter.
These consent letters are not subject to the page limitations.

5.2.  Past Performance Information

a.    Each offeror shall submit past performance information for itself and for each proposed subcontractor or joint venture partner.  Offerors
are notified that the Government will use the data provided in these volumes that is determined to be current and relevant to the effort at hand
and data obtained from other sources in the development of performance risk assessments.

b.    The purpose of the Past Performance Volume is to evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying services
that meet the users’ needs, including cost and schedule.  The Government is seeking to assess past performance which is relevant to the
Technical/Management Factor and Subfactors, the Cost/Price Factor, and consideration of other efforts such as cost control, compliance with
schedule, responsiveness, customer satisfaction, etc.  Complete Attachment 1 for each contract.

5.2.1 Specific Content
Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort and to what aspects of the proposed
effort they relate.  This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as
well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.  Merely having problems does not automatically equate to a limited or no confidence
rating, since the problems encountered may have been on a more complex program, or an offeror may have subsequently demonstrated the ability to
overcome the problems encountered.  The offeror is required to clearly demonstrate management actions employed in overcoming problems and the
effects of those actions in terms of improvements achieved or problems rectified.  This may allow the offeror to be considered a higher
confidence candidate.  For example, submittal of quality performance indicators or other management indicators that clearly support that an
offeror has overcome past problems is required.  Categorize the relevant information into the specific Technical/Management subfactors and
Cost/Price factor used to evaluate the proposal.

a.    Current and Relevant Contracts.  For the purpose of this solicitation, current contracts are defined as those in which performance
occurred after 30 September 2007.  Evaluators will consider the relevant contract’s technical requirement and the Government’s appraisal of the
relevant contract’s technical comparability to the support described in paragraph e, below.  Preference will be given for technical
experience/past performance related to DeCA, and/or major grocery store chains.  Other technical past performance may be considered relevant as
well.  The Government will assess the relevancy of each specific example of past or present performance as Very Relevant, Relevant, Somewhat
Relevant, or Not Relevant.  The definitions for relevancy are outlined in Section M of this solicitation.

b.    Format of Present and Past Performance Data.  The offeror shall submit information on the five (5) contracts (including information on
subcontractors, if applicable) it considers current and relevant to demonstrate its ability to perform this effort.  The offeror shall provide
the information in paragraph 2.e(1) below for each contract (and/or task order).  The offeror shall briefly explain how and why it considers the
contracts relevant.  Additionally, the offeror shall summarize present and past performance results as they relate to:

      -- Cost Control
      -- Schedule Control
      -- Quality of Performance and Customer Satisfaction

The following table at Attachment 1 shall be used to list current and relevant contracts.  The Government will use the offeror's explanation of
why it believes a specific contract(s) (and/or task order(s)) is relevant to the indicated tasking and its own judgment to determine the degree
of relevancy to be considered in making the past performance evaluation.

c.    Past Performance Questionnaires (Attachment 2). The offeror shall initiate the Past Performance Questionnaires for each of the contracts
used above.  The offeror shall complete blocks 1 through 7 on the form.  The offeror shall request that the owner’s representative most
knowledgeable of the project complete block 8 on the form and that they submit the Past Performance Questionnaires directly to the Contracting
Officer identified on the form no later than the proposal due date.  Offerors are responsible for ensuring that the telephone numbers provided
for the owner’s representative indicated on each Relevant Project Summary are accurate and that the representative is aware that the DeCA and/or
DITCO may be contacting them regarding the questionnaire and the offeror’s past performance.  Offerors are also reminded that it is their
responsibility to ensure the Questionnaires are properly received by the due date and time specified herein.  If subcontractor or commercial
client information is included as past performance information, Attachments 3 and 4 shall be completed as applicable by the appropriate point of
contact.

5.2.2 Administrative Data
Administrative data for contracts the offeror believes to be relevant to a particular tasking:  Provide the name, address, facsimile, and
telephone number(s) of a point of contact(s) (POC).  Choose POCs who have detailed and in-depth knowledge of the work performed on the
referenced contract (and/or task order).  The offeror shall verify the availability of the POC(s) to discuss the offeror’s past performance with
Source Selection Personnel.

5.2.3 No Applicable Past Performance Information
If an offeror has no current or relevant past performance information, it should so state in this volume. In the case where the offeror does not
have a record of relevant present or past performance or where information about past performance is not available, it will not be evaluated
either favorably or unfavorably.

5.2.4  Organizational Structure Change History
Many companies have acquired, been acquired by, or otherwise merged with other companies, and/or reorganized their divisions, business groups,
subsidiary companies, etc.  In many cases, these changes have taken place during the time of performance of relevant past efforts or between
conclusion of recent past efforts and this source selection.  As a result, it is sometimes difficult to determine what past performance is
relevant to this procurement.  To facilitate this relevancy determination, include in this proposal volume a “roadmap” describing all such
changes in the organization of your company.  A pamphlet or other commercial document describing such reorganizations may suffice.  As part of
this explanation, show how these changes impact the relevance of any efforts you identify for past performance evaluation/performance confidence
assessment.  Since the Government intends to consider past performance information provided by other sources as well as that provided by the
offerors, your “roadmap” should be both specifically applicable to the efforts you identify and general enough to apply to efforts on which the
Government receives information from other sources.




6.0         Volume IV - Cost/Price



6.1   General Instructions


Offerors shall provide a separate price proposal for the Sample Task Order 0001.If the task order is determined to have fair and reasonable
prices,  Sample Task Order 0001 will be awarded based on on-site rates simultaneously with the contract award without further discussions or
negotiations.  Proposals for the basic award shall include rates for both on-site and off-site on a Cost Plus Fixed Fee basis. Compliance with
these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your proposal.

Offerors are required to submit their proposed costs for the entire 57 month period.  The evaluation period commences with the date of contract
award with the base period running through 30 September 2011 and ends after 4 one-year options.  Contract months and evaluation months are
assumed to be the same.  The cost proposal must be submitted in Microsoft Excel, to include all formulas and calculations.  All spreadsheets
must roll up into the aforementioned summary page.  The cost proposal must include a full breakout of the detailed cost amounts of all resources
required to accomplish the task, (i.e. labor categories, labor hours, number of employees for each labor category, rates, travel, incidental
equipment, etc.).  Labor and overhead rates should include sufficient detail to sustain a DCAA audit (e.g. Direct Labor Rates, Overhead, Fringe
Benefits, G&A, and Fee, etc.).  In addition, all other proposed costs must be fully supported and supporting documentation to support prices
should be provided.  All Other Direct Costs (ODCs), which include Travel and Materials, must show the specific detail, if known.  For example,
all Travel must include (i.e. Number of days, locations, number of personnel, etc.).  All Materials shall annotate the specific detail (qty,
part number, manufacturer, etc.) to include supporting documentation to justify the cost (i.e. vendor quotes, price history, etc.).  If a
subcontractor relationship exists, the subcontractor must break out their costs, in accordance with the above requirements.  If needed, the
subcontractor may submit their cost breakout directly to the KO.  The subcontractor shall provide contact information for their cognizant DCAA
office.  Offerors will propose a fixed fee in accordance with FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i).  If applicable, travel, shall be authorized by the Task
Monitor (TM), in writing, prior to performance and will be paid IAW FAR 31.205-46 and the Joint Federal Travel Regulations.  NOTE: Other Direct
Costs  other than Travel will be included in contract award as a subCLIN but will only be funded at such time it is determined materials, i.e.,
software, hardware, supplies, are required.



6.1.1 Cost/Price Reasonableness and Realism

This section is to assist you in submitting information other than cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness realism,
and balance  of your proposed cost/price.  Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your
proposal.  Note that unrealistically low or high proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal
from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an unrealistic proposal.
Additionally, unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror’s proposal.  Offers
should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness.  The burden of proof for credibility of proposed costs/prices rests with
the offeror.

6.1.2 Estimating Techniques and Methods
When responding to the Cost/Price Volume requirements in the solicitation, the offeror and associated subcontractors may use any generally
accepted estimating technique, including contemporary estimating methods to develop their estimates.

6.1.3 Cost/Price Information
Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your
cost/price position.  All information relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the
section of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price volume.  Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included
elsewhere in the proposal.


6.1.4 Cost or Pricing Information Requirements


In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), information other than cost or pricing data may be required to support price reasonableness.
  Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5.  If, after receipt of proposals, the CO determines that there is insufficient
information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the offeror shall be required to
submit cost or pricing data.

6.2 Estimating Methodology

Provide a summary description of your purchasing system or methods (e.g., how material requirements are determined, how sources are selected,
when firm quotes are obtained, what provision is made to ensure quantity and other discounts).  Also, identify any deviations from your standard
procedures in preparing this proposal.  Indicate whether you have Government approval of your system and if so, provide evidence of such
approval.

6.2.3 Accounting System

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award

SECTION M
EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M001. Evaluation Criteria

This outlines the Evaluation Criteria the Government will consider in evaluating the offeror’s capabilities and the proposals submitted in
response to the solicitation.  The Evaluation Criteria are intended to show the scope of the evaluation to be performed on proposals submitted
in response to the solicitation.  Information gathered from the evaluation will be provided to the Source Selection Authority (SSA) for use in
making a source selection decision in accordance with the paragraphs below.  Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information, in the
format specified in the Instructions to Offerors, to enable the evaluator(s) to fully ascertain each offeror’s capability to perform all the
requirements contemplated by this solicitation.  Offerors may be asked, at the discretion of the Government, to provide additional information
for clarification.  However, the Government may award without holding discussions.  As a result, the offeror’s initial proposal should reflect
their best effort.

Only highly rated proposals, before discussions, will be included in the competitive range.

a. Basis for Contract Award

This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented
by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the DISA Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DARS).  These regulations are
available electronically at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment
of (1) Technical/Management, (2)  Past Performance, and (3) Cost/Price.  Contracts may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible in
accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation’s requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions,
representations, certifications, and all other information required by Section L of this solicitation) and is judged, based on the evaluation
factors and subfactors to represent the best value to the Government.  The Government seeks to award to the offeror who gives the Government the
greatest confidence that it will best meet, or exceed, the requirements.  This may result in an award to a higher rated and/or higher priced
offeror, where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors  as long as the Source Selection Authority (SSA) reasonably determines
that the higher ranked technical/management, overall business approach, and/or greater past performance of the higher price offeror outweighs
the cost difference.  The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment of proposals against all source selection
criteria in the solicitation (described below).  While the Government source selection evaluation team and the SSA will strive for maximum
objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective; and therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire
process.

b. Number of Contractors to be selected

The Government contemplates the award of one contract for the DMO/EDW/BI Support Services; however, the Government reserves the right to make no
award at all.


c. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers

The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, contract terms and conditions, or
unrealistically high or low in cost when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of
competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.


d. Correction Potential of Proposals

The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency or uncertainty.  The judgment of such
"correction potential" is within the sole discretion of the Government.  If an aspect of an offeror's proposal does not meet the Government's
requirements and is not considered correctable, the offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range.

e. Small Disadvantaged Business.

All proposals will be evaluated as to the extent of participation of  Small  Disadvantaged  Business  (SDB)  firms.   The  targets  submitted  in
accordance with FAR 52.219-24, and Section L, paragraph 7.3.4, will be incorporated into  and  become  part  of  the  contract.   The  successful
offeror will be required to provide reports on SDB subcontractor participation in accordance with FAR 52.219-25 in Section I of the contract.

If the offeror is other than a small business, the offeror’s Small Business Subcontracting Plan submitted in accordance with FAR 52.219-9, or
Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan submitted in accordance with DFARS 219-702, and Section L paragraph 7.3.5, shall also be evaluated to
determine the extent to which the offeror identifies and commits to the participation of Small Businesses (SB), Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institution (MI) whether as joint venture members, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  Failure to submit
such a plan will render the offeror ineligible for award.

In arriving at a best value decision, the Government reserves the right to give positive consideration, i.e., assign  strength,  for  performance
in excess of threshold requirements.

M002. EVALUATION FACTORS

a.    Evaluation Factors and Subfactors
      (1)  The following evaluation factors and subfactors will be used to evaluate each proposal: Award will be made to the offeror proposing
the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and subfactors described
below.







      Factor 1:   Technical/Management
           NOTE:  Technical/Management evaluations will be conducted on proposals for the basic PWS and the Sample Task Order PWS.


           Subfactor 1.1:   Technical Approach


           Subfactor 1.2:   Qualifications of Assigned Personnel


      Subfactor 1.3:   Phase-In PlanFactor 2: Past Performance

           Subfactor 2.1:   Cost Control


           Subfactor 2.2:   Schedule Control


           Subfactor 2.3:   Quality of Performance and Customer Satisfaction

      Factor 3:   Cost/Price


                   Subfactor 3.1: Cost/Price based on Basic PWS
                   Subfactor 3.2: Cost/Price based on Sample Task Order PWS




      (2)  Relative Importance of Factors and Subfactors.  The evaluation of Factor 1 (Technical/Management) and Factor 2 (Past Performance),
when combined, are more importance than Factor 3 (Cost/Price).  Factor 1 is more important that Factor 2.  Factor 1 and Factor 2 include
subfactors which are of equal importance.

b.    Technical/Management Factor
The technical/management evaluation provides for two distinct but related assessments:  the Technical/ Management rating and the
Technical/Management risk rating.  These two ratings have equal impact for the rating of each Technical/Management subfactor.

 Technical/Management Rating.  The Technical/Management rating provides an assessment of the offeror’s capability to satisfy the Government’s
requirements.  Each Technical/Management subfactor will receive one of the color ratings described in the Technical/Management Ratings provided
below.


|Color           |Rating                     |Description                                                                                  |
|Blue            |                           |Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the  |
|                |Exceptional                |government. A proposal must have one or more strengths and no deficiencies to receive a blue.|
|Green           |                           |Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements. A proposal must have no      |
|                |Acceptable                 |deficiencies to receive a green but may have one or more strengths.                          |
|Yellow          |                           |There is doubt regarding whether an aspect of the proposal meets a specified minimum         |
|                |Marginal                   |performance or capability requirements, but any such uncertainty is correctable.             |
|Red             |                           |Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements. The proposal has one |
|                |Unacceptable               |or more deficiencies and is not awardable.                                                   |


They focus on the strengths, deficiencies, and uncertainties of the offeror's proposal.  The color rating depicts how well the offeror’s
proposal meets the Technical/Management subfactor requirements.  Subfactor ratings shall not be rolled up into an overall color rating for the
Technical/Management Factor.

 Definitions:

Strength:  Significant aspect of an offeror’s proposal that has merit and exceeds specified performance or capability requirements in a way that
is advantageous to the Government, and either will be included in the contract or is inherent in the offeror’s process.

Deficiency:  A material failure of a proposal to meet a government requirement.

Uncertainty:  A doubt regarding whether an aspect of the proposal meets a material performance or capability requirement. It requires additional
information from the offeror to further explain the proposal before the evaluator can complete his/her review and analysis and should generate
the issuance of an EN.


c. Technical/Management Subfactors

(1)   Subfactor 1.1:   Technical Approach

The offeror shall present a clear, responsive, and realistic understanding of and approach to accomplishing all tasks in the PWS and the Sample
Task Order PWS, Attachment 5, to be awarded consecutively with the award of this requirement.

(2)   Subfactor 1.2:   Qualifications of Assigned Personnel

The offeror shall present a responsive, realistic plan to recruit, train and assign personnel to the initial and subsequent task orders under
this contract.  Clearly demonstrate that individuals proposed for each labor category possess the necessary knowledge, training, successful
experience and appropriate certifications to perform all of the duties of that position as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS
14.0.b).

Required certifications identified as such, in PWS and Sample Task Order, shall be a mandatory requirement of this effort.  Certifications
marked as desired, are optional for performance of this effort.  However, during evaluation of proposals, favorable consideration will be given
to offerors who propose labor categories with desired certifications.


(3)   Subfactor 1.3:   Phase-In Plan

The offeror shall present a responsive, realistic plan to ramp up with the appropriate technical expertise including  key  personnel  during  the
Phase-In period.  Present a clear, reasoned approach to assuming responsibility for any on-going tasks and  completing  the  transition  to  full
contract responsibility by the conclusion of the Phase-In period not later than 60 days after contract award  as  described  in  the  Performance
Work Statement (PWS 6.14).

(4)  Technical/Management Risk Rating.  The Technical/Management Risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with an offeror's proposed
approach and includes an assessment of the potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance, the need for
increased Government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance.

The Technical/Management subfactors will receive one of the risk ratings outlined in the Proposal Risk Assessment Table provided below.    They
focus on the risks, i.e., weaknesses and significant weaknesses, of the offeror’s proposed approach to each of the Technical/Management
subfactors.  For any weakness identified, the evaluation shall address the offeror's proposed mitigation and why that mitigation approach is or
is not manageable.


Definitions:

“Deficiency” is a  combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an
unacceptable level.

“Weakness” means a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.

“Significant Weakness” in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.


Proposal Risk Assessment – Risk Assessment Description Table


|Risk                    |Description                                                                                                    |
|                        |Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal     |
|Low                     |contractor effort and normal government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties.           |
|                        |Can potentially cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.  Special contractor|
|Moderate                |emphasis and close government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties.                         |
|                        |Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.              |
|High                    |Extraordinary contractor emphasis and rigorous government monitoring may be able to overcome difficulties.     |
|                        |The existence of a significant weakness or combination of weaknesses that is very likely to cause unmitigated  |
|Unacceptable            |disruption of schedule, drastically increased cost or severely degraded performance.  Proposals with an        |
|                        |unacceptable rating are not awardable.                                                                         |

d. Past Performance Factor

The past performance evaluation assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror’s ability to supply products and services
that meet users’ needs based on a demonstrated record of performance, including cost and schedule.

      (1) Ratings.  The past performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments described in the Performance
Confidence Assessments Table below.  Performance confidence assessment ratings are assigned pursuant to e (3) below.


Performance Confidence Assessment Table


|Rating                       |Description                                                                                                |
|                             |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will     |
|Substantial Confidence       |successfully perform the required effort.                                                                  |
|                             |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will         |
|Satisfactory Confidence      |successfully perform the required effort.                                                                  |
|                             |Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will      |
|Limited                      |successfully perform the required effort.                                                                  |
|Confidence                   |                                                                                                           |
|No                           | Based on the offeror’s performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able|
|Confidence                   |to successfully perform the required effort.                                                               |
|Unknown Confidence****       |No performance record is identifiable or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse that no confidence  |
|                             |assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.                                                              |


      (2) Evaluation Process.  The past performance evaluation considers the offeror’s demonstrated record of performance in providing products
and services that meet users’ needs.  Performance confidence is assessed at the overall past performance factor level after evaluating aspects
of the offeror’s recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the technical/management subfactors and cost/price factor
taking into consideration their relative order of importance stated in M002a.  The Government may consider past performance in the aggregate in
addition to on an individual contract basis.  In conducting the past performance evaluation, the Government reserves the right to use both the
information provided in the offeror’s Past Performance proposal volume and information obtained from other sources, such as the Past Performance
Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), CPARS, or similar systems, Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and commercial sources.


           (i) Recency Assessment
An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must
have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails
this condition will not be evaluated.
           (ii) Relevancy Assessment
The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine how closely the products
provided/services performed under those contracts relate to the Technical/ Management subfactors and Cost/Price factor, including their relative
order of importance (reference M002a).  For each recent past performance citation reviewed, the relevance of the work performed will generally
be assessed for the Technical/Management subfactors and Cost/Price factor (however, all aspects of performance that relate to this procurement
may be considered).  Consideration will be given to offeror performance related to the following:

      --  Cost Control – Assesses offeror’s demonstrated performance in managing and controlling costs


      --  Schedule Control – Assesses offeror’s demonstrated performance in meeting contract schedules


      --  Quality of Performance and Customer Satisfaction – Assesses offeror’s demonstrated performance in providing expert quality services and
      achieving high levels of customer satisfaction


A relevancy determination of the offeror’s past performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations, including joint venture
partners and major and critical subcontractors.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort,
or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  The
past performance information forms and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the degree of relevancy of past
performance.  The Government will use the following degrees of relevancy  when assessing recent, relevant contracts:

           Performance Relevancy Definitions


|Relevancy                    |Definition                                                                                                 |
|                             |Past/Present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this    |
|Highly Relevant (HR)         |solicitation requires.                                                                                     |
|                             |Past/Present performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation|
|Relevant (R)                 |requires.                                                                                                  |
|                             |Past/Present performance effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation|
|Somewhat Relevant (SR)       |requires.                                                                                                  |
|Not Relevant (NR)            |Past/Present performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this       |
|                             |solicitation requires.                                                                                     |



            (iii) Performance Quality Assessment
The Government will consider the performance quality of recent, relevant efforts.  For each recent past performance citation reviewed, the
performance quality of the work performed will be assessed for the technical/management subfactors and cost/price factor (however, all aspects
of performance that relate to this procurement may be considered.  The quality assessment consists of an in-depth evaluation of the past
performance questionnaire responses, PPIRS or CPARS information, interviews with Government customers and fee determining officials, and if
applicable, commercial clients.  It may include interviews with DCMA officials or other sources known to the Government.  Pursuant to FAR
15.305(a)(2)(v), the assessment will consider the extent to which the offeror’s evaluated past performance demonstrates compliance with
subcontracting plan goals for small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns, monetary targets for SDB participation, and notifications submitted
under FAR 52.219-25, Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Program -  Disadvantaged Status and Reporting.  Pursuant to DFARS 215.305(a)(2),
the assessment will also consider the extent to which the offeror’s evaluated past  performance demonstrates compliance with FAR 52.219-8,
Utilization of Small Business Concerns and FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  The quality assessment may result in positive or
adverse findings.  Adverse is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or
any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system.  For adverse information identified, the evaluation will consider
the number and severity of the problems, mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of corrective actions that have resulted in sustained
improvements.  Process changes will only be considered when objectively measurable improvements in performance have been demonstrated.  The
Government will use the following quality levels when assessing recent, relevant efforts:

      (3) Assigning Ratings.  As a result of the relevancy and quality assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an
integrated performance confidence assessment rating.  Although the past performance evaluation focuses on performance that is relevant to the
Technical/Management subfactors and Cost/Price factor, the resulting performance confidence assessment rating is made at the factor level and
represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance.  Offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on
past performance is not available or so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned will not be evaluated favorably
or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating for the past performance factor.

More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than less recent or relevant effort.  A
strong record of relevant past performance may be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating.  Likewise,
a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of
favorable performance.

e. Cost/Price Factor
This factor will evaluate the price proposals offered by the company.  The Offeror is required to submit all pricing data in the format
indicated in Sections B and L of the solicitation.  Offerors are required to submit their proposed costs (on site and off site rates) for the
entire 57-month period.  The evaluation period commences with the date of contract award and runs through 30 September 2011 with four one-year
options.  Anticipated award date is the 2nd quarter of FY 2011.   Contract months and evaluation months are assumed to be the same.  Evaluation
of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.

Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC) - Upon satisfaction of the above conditions, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes based on
the total Discounted Life Cycle Cost (DLCC) to include options over a 57 month period.  The Government will multiply the evaluated price for the
base period and each of option periods by the appropriate discount factor.  The discounted annual amounts will then be summed to calculate the
total DLCC.  Although the evaluation period will be for 57 months of service, evaluation of option year pricing shall not be construed to
indicate a commitment by the government to exercise all options.  Based on the 2009 nominal interest rate listed in OMB Circular No. A-94, the
discount factors shown below will be used for evaluation.

(4)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the price for all option years to the price for the base period
requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option year prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of
option years shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).


The total proposed price for each offeror will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness, and if necessary, price realism.  Cost/Price will
not be rated with a color.   Definitions follow

    • Completeness: The Government will verify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs
      are presented in a clear and useful format.


    • Reasonableness:  The Government will determine the reasonableness of the overall price based on adequate price competition and by
      comparison with the Government's Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).


    • Realism: The Government reserves the right to conduct a price realism analysis to determine whether an offeror's proposed prices are
      realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements and are consistent with the various elements of
      the technical proposal.




f. Discussions

If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to
Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision.

Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and
technical/management requirements, in addition to those identified as factors and subfactors. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of
the solicitation may result in the offeror being ineligible for award and/or rejection of offerors proposal. Offerors must clearly identify any
exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and must provide complete supporting rationale for each exception.
