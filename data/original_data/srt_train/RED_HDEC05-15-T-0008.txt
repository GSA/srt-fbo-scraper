This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should

HDEC05-15-T-0008 Page 20 of 34 the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

Statement of Work 
By Federal mandate, the Healthy, HungerFree Kids Act of 2010, Public Law (P.L.) 111 296, includes several provisions related to Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) in the Special  Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (42 U.S.C. 1786).  Pursuant  to section 17(h)(12)(B), each state agency must implement an EBT system throughout the state  by October 1, 2020.  The Act allows for each state Food and Nutritional Service agencies to  require retail vendors to pay such costs as a condition for authorization or program  participation once the EBT system is implemented statewide.  Each state designs its own WIC  EBT system and acceptance procedures.  As a critical benefit, DeCA must comply to remain a  viable shopping benefit for those patrons who use WIC.    The State of Ohio is implementing WIC EBT in Green and Montgomery counties effective  August 1, 2014 which affects the WrightPatterson AFB commissary.  As a result of this  implementation, DeCA is procuring three standbeside machines and maintenance for the base  and option years for the WrightPatterson Commissary.  These machines must have the  following required capabilities:   The WIC EBT standbeside machine will include standard functionality a receipt printer, a hand held bar code scanner, and a card reader for each register.  Network capable in accordance with DoD network security standard (NIST Special Publication  i.e. SP80047 Security Guide). Devices will get pricing and software updates automatically via a  central location (example instore or cloud server) however remote access to the store terminal  will not be allowed (e.g. Remote Desktop Protocol, Virtual Network Computing, etc.).  System must provide the capability to key in manual price inputs based on WIC's items. DeCA should 
be able to key in pricing at one terminal or from a device that would connect to instore or cloud server  and updates should appear on all standbeside machines. 

Must be able to automatically download Approved Price List (APL) file from the state on a  nightly basis using standard FTP/SFTP protocols as required by the state.  Must be able to automatically create a Claim and Settlement Report on a nightly basis on any  business day the store is open.  The system must not allow the user to access websites or any other nonWIC related  information. The network firewall will not allow the device to connect to any Internet sites  except for those required for WIC EBT. 

Proposal must provide for the initial training of at least one customer service supervisor or lead  cashier; training can be on location or provided remotely by a trainer.  In addition, training  assistance must be provided either through a help key, training aids, a training CD, or online  tutorials.   System must be able to add DeCA's surcharge accurately and automatically by item or  transaction.      Proposal must provide for installation of 3 standbeside machines to include set up,  configuration, and coordination with DeCA store representatives and network team.     System hardware is required to fit (within the allotted space) in the current Point of Sale (POS)  equipment currently at the registers. A layout or schematic will be attached to this proposal.   Hardware and software system maintenance must be performed in accordance with DoD  security regulations (DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity). DoD does not allow the use of USB thumb  drives so software updates must rely on other data exchange technologies.  Verification or validation must be confirmed by the Store director or designated Store  representative and a State representative to ensure completion of work. Contractor must  demonstrate that the system works as designed and the APL file is pulled and applied correctly  prior to signing off.  All work must be completed within 30 days of contract award date.
