B.    GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO QUOTER

      INTRODUCTION

      The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum requirements for the format and contents of the quotation/proposal.
      Special attention is directed to the requirements for the technical and business proposals to be submitted in accordance with these
      instructions.

            1.   INSTRUCTIONS TO QUOTER


           (a)   Restriction on disclosure and use of data. (1) The proposal submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade
                 secrets; business data, e.g., commercial information, financial information, and cost and pricing data; and technical data)
                 which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for
                 evaluation of the proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government determines
                 that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror
                 marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following legend, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to
                 be restricted in accordance with the conditions of the legend. The Government's determination to withhold or disclose a record
                 will be based upon the particular circumstances involving the record in question and whether the record may be exempted from
                 disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The legend reads:

                             Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined
                            by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services, data contained in the
                            portions of this proposal which have been specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. by the offeror as
                            containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes.

                             The offeror acknowledges that the Department may not be able to withhold a record (data, document, etc.) nor deny
                            access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the Department's FOI officials must make that
                            determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if the Department has
                            determined that disclosure is required by the Act.

                             If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the
                            Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not
                            resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act.

                             The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or
                            disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act. The
                            data subject to this restriction are contained in pages (insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other
                            identification).

                 (2)   In addition, the offeror should mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following statement:

                             “Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal
                            or quotation.”

                 (3)   The offeror is cautioned that a quotation submitted with restrictive legends or statements differing in substance from
                       the above legend may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with
                       a nonconforming legend.

           authority which authorizes the solicitation, whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory, the principal purpose for which the
           information is intended to be used, the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information, and the effects on the

           In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals
           are requested to disclose their social security number.

           essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost or price.  In any event, the Government reserves the right
           to make an award to that offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government


      2.    EVALUATION CRITERIA

           In determining which offer represents the best value (i.e., corporate experience, technical expertise of proposed staff, other direct
           costs, and administrative costs) to meet the Government’s needs, the Government shall evaluate responses using the following
           evaluation criteria:



           2.1   Technical and Management Approach (50%)

           This refers to the manner in which the offeror proposes to plan, manage, control, and provide the services and deliverables  under  a
           Fixed Price award mechanism and as specified in the Statement of Work.


           The offeror’s proposed technical and management approach must include strong performance measures. Examples of  performance  measures
           might include adherence to milestone schedules, error rates, and levels of customer satisfaction.


           2.2   Experience and Expertise of Proposed Staff (35%)

           The offeror’s staff will be evaluated based on descriptions of key roles and submitted resumes and “Letters of Commitment”
           illustrating an appropriate skill mix; and experience of key staff and other proposed technical, management, and project support
           staff.


           2.3   Corporate Capabilities and Past Performance (15%)

           This criterion refers to the offeror’s corporate resources and capabilities and performance results (outcomes) of similar tasks for
           the NIH or in other government contract efforts of similar magnitude.  These contracts and projects must have been completed within
           the past three (3) years or currently in progress for services similar to the requirements specified in the Statement of Work.

           The offeror’s corporate capabilities will be evaluated based on the offeror’s description and discussion of its corporation and any
           proposed subcontractors demonstrating corporate resources and capabilities to perform the tasks contained in the Statement of Work.

           The Government will conduct reference checks in order to determine the offeror’s corporate past performance.  In this regard, for
           each key personnel proposed and for each contracted project listed, the offeror shall provide a point of contact (name and telephone
           number) to support past performance.

No Contractor employee will be directly supervised by the Government.  All individual employee assignments, and daily work direction, shall be given by the applicable Contractor supervisor.  If the Contractor believes any Government action or communication has been given that would create a personal services relationship between the Government and any Contractor employee, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer of this communication or action.



Pursuant to FAR 7.5, the Contractor shall not perform any inherently governmental actions under this SOW.  No Contractor employee shall hold him or herself out to be a Government employee, agent, or representative.  No Contractor employee shall state orally or in writing at any time that he or she is acting on behalf of the Government.

The Contractor shall insure that all of its employees working on this SOW are informed of the substance of this article.  Nothing in this article shall limit the Government’s rights in any way under the other provisions of this SOW, including those related to the Government’s right to inspect and accept the services to be performed under this SOW.  The substance of this article shall be included in all subcontracts at any tier.




19.0	ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST



Purpose:  The purpose of this article is to ensure that the Contractor (1) is not biased because of its financial, contractual, organizational, or other interest which relate to the work under this Purchase order, and (2) does not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of its performance of this Purchase order.

Scope:  The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the Contractor and any of its affiliates or their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Contractor") in activities covered by this article as a prime contractor, subcontractor, cosponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity.  For the purpose of this article, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.



"Organizational conflict of interest" means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage (FAR 9.501).  An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on an instant contract, or when the nature of the work to be performed on the instant contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition (FAR 9.502(c)).



Because of the unusual nature of the work performed under this Purchase order, and the fact that the Contractor will have access from time to time to sensitive Government information, and because some of the work will be performed in Government facilities, the Government must maintain a special, close relationship with the Contractor and the Contractor's personnel in various important areas.



The Contractor shall not use this privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector.



The Contractor is required to conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government, to operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence, to be free from organizational conflicts of interest, and to have full disclosure of its affairs to the sponsoring agency.



The Contractor shall be ineligible to participate in any capacity in contracts, subcontracts, or proposals therefore (solicited and unsolicited) which stem directly from the Contractor's performance of work under this contract for a period of one (1) year after the completion of this Purchase order, except as provided hereinafter.



If, under this Purchase order, the Contractor prepares a complete or essentially complete statement of work or specifications to be used in competitive acquisitions, the Contractor shall be ineligible to perform or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort that is based on such statement of work or specifications.  The Contractor shall not incorporate its products or services in such statement of work or specifications unless approved in writing by the Contracting Officer, in which case the restriction in this subparagraph shall not apply.



It is imperative that the Contractor be proactive in order to avoid organizational conflicts of interest.  The Contractor shall take all reasonable measures to assure that organizational conflicts of interest do not occur.  As part of the Contractor's efforts to avoid organizational conflict of interest situations, the Contractor shall inform the Government of any actual, potential, or apparent conflicts of interest.  The Contractor is responsible for providing a detailed written report of actual, potential, or apparent organizational conflicts of interest to the Contracting Officer as soon as the circumstance is known, describing the conflict and how the Contractor plans to resolve the problem.



Subcontracts:  The Contractor shall include an article, substantially similar to this article, in subcontracts involving the performance of advisory and assistance services as that term is defined at FAR 37.201.  The terms "contract," "contractor," and "contracting officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.



20.0	RIGHTS IN DATA



The Contractor agrees that upon completion (or termination with or without cause) of this Delivery  Order, it shall have no property or possessor rights to any of the correspondence, files, or materials of whatever kind or description, or any copies or duplicates of such, whether developed or prepared by it or furnished to it by the Government in connection with the performance of this Delivery  Order; and that upon demand it shall surrender immediately to the Contracting Officer such items, matters, materials, and copies. 



The Contractor shall not provide any Government documents, information or licensed material in any form to sources not authorized by the Government, during or after performance of this Purchase order, without the written approval of the COR.



All data/information first produced as a result of performing task assignments under this Purchase order shall become the Federal Government’s property and the Contractor shall surrender any and all rights to its ownership.  To this end, the Contractor hereby agrees to accept the terms and conditions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.227-17, Rights in Data – Special Works (December 2007) which is incorporated into this Delivery  Order by reference.



For purposes of this Purchase order, the FAR 52.227-17, Rights in Data – Special Works (December 2007) clause supersedes the FAR 52.227- 14, Rights in Data – General (December 2007) clause.



21.0	ACCESS TO NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) ELECTRONIC MAIL



All Contractor staff that have access to and use of NIH electronic mail (e-mail) must identify themselves as contractors on all outgoing e-mail messages, including those that are sent in reply or are forwarded to another user.  To best comply with this requirement, the Contractor staff shall set up an e-mail signature (“AutoSignature”) or an electronic business card (“V-card”) on each contractor employee’s computer system and/or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) that will automatically display “Contractor” in the signature area of all e-mails sent.

During a period of Government closure, a Contractor employee with a Government approved secure laptop computer may report to work at the Contractor’s facility, provided that approval has been received from the COR or the Contractor’s Employee Project Manager.



A Contractor employee may work from home only when approval is obtained beforehand from the COR or the Contractor’s Employee Project Manager.



24.0	TELEWORK DURING A GOVERNMENT CLOSURE



During a period of Government closure, a Contractor employee with a Government-furnished (i.e., Government-issued) or approved computer/laptop may telework from home or some other alternate work location (including the Contractor’s facility) that is not a “Federally-controlled facility”, provided that approval has been received from the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) or the Contractor’s Employee Project Manager.  Since teleworking will be authorized only as a short-term remedy to an emergency situation, the Contractor agrees that there will be no additional charges to the Government.  



Each Contractor employee authorized to telework shall comply with all of the following conditions:



•	Use either (1) only a Government-furnished computer/laptop with all necessary software and hardware when teleworking from home or some other alternate work location, or (2) an approved computer by either the COR or the Contractor’s Employee Project Manager satisfying the most recent contract computer security requirements.

•	Maintain the teleworker’s work schedule and meet the terms agreed upon with the Contractor’s Employee Project Manager.

•	Protect the Contractor employee’s approved telework location from hazards and danger that could affect the Government-furnished equipment and the teleworker.

•	Acknowledge that teleworking is not an entitlement and may be terminated by the COR or the Contractor’s Employee Project Manager at any time.

•	Restrict the use of any Government-furnished equipment, software, data, and supplies located at the Contractor employee’s approved telework location to the sole use of conducting Government business.

•	Return any Government-furnished telework equipment, software, data, and supplies upon termination of the telework assignment or upon separation from this acquisition for any reason.

•	Immediately notify the Contractor’s Employee Project Manager of any equipment malfunction and the impact of the malfunction upon the teleworker’s ability to continue the telework assignment; and obtain instructions from the Contractor’s Employee Project Manager about working at another alternate work location.

•	Be responsible for the maintenance and repair of all the teleworker’s personal property, and for maintaining appropriate insurance coverage against loss or theft for all Government-furnished equipment/supplies in the possession of the teleworker.

•	Acknowledge that all work products, including documents, reports, and data created as a result of the teleworker’s work-related activities are owned by the Government and shall be properly secured and returned to the Government as instructed by the Contractor’s Employee Project Manager.

•	Acknowledge receipt and compliance with the NIH Telework Policy (NIH Policy Manual Chapter 2300-600-1, ).

•	Acknowledge receipt and compliance with the NIH technology guidelines on use of Government-furnished equipment for telework assignments.

•	Acknowledge receipt and compliance with NIH Information, Physical Access, and Personal Identity Information (PII) Security provisions applicable to the acquisition.

•	Report as soon as possible to the Contractor’s Employee Project Manager any job-related accident during the Contractor employee’s telework schedule.  If injured in the course of performing official duties at the approved telework location during the approved telework schedule, the teleworker shall be governed by Workman’s Compensation through the Contractor.	



Under circumstances other than a Government closure, the COR or the Contractor’s Project Manager may authorize a Contractor employee to telework under the above conditions.



25.0	CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS DURING A GOVERNMENT CLOSURE



The Contractor shall submit a plan entitled Continuity of Operations During a Government Closure to the COR for approval within 20 calendar days following an instruction from the COR to do so.  The plan shall sufficiently specify what work tasks would be performed at non-Government location(s) (i.e., not a “Federally-controlled facility”) during a closure and which Contractor employees would be authorized to telework under the TELEWORK DURING A GOVERNMENT CLOSURE provision of this acquisition.



The Contractor shall implement its approved Continuity of Operations During a Government Closure plan when directed by the COR.
