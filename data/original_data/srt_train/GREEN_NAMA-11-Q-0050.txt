External Interface Architecture and Approach

Figure 1shows the NARA Systems Interface planned as the systems are modernized and deployed. Within the scope of the Description and Authority Services solution project are Authority interfaces to the ARCIS, ERA, and HMS systems. Description Services has interfaces from ERA and HMS and provides an interface to OPA.



Figure 1: NARA Systems Interfaces







Interface Approach

Most current interfaces rely on a file passing approach as the means for exchanging information between systems. In a service oriented approach to interfaces, information exchanges rely on real-time messages between systems to pass, retrieve, or validate data. While we would like DAS interfaces to behave in a real-time service oriented manner, we recognize that the ARCIS, HMS, ERA, and OPA systems may require modifications to consume or publish service oriented interface operations. With that in mind, we will be applying SOA design principles that will allow for the current interface mechanisms to be accomplished, while allowing for easy transitions to a real-time service oriented approach as the consuming or providing systems are modified. 

The architecture to support this approach is shown in Figure 2. This interface architecture uses the message queue paradigm to accomplish the current interface requirements, but it can be easily switched to one that is real-time Web service, an ftp site, or some other target channel. In this diagram the external interface service could represent ARCIS, OPA, ERA, or HMS. The idea here would be that the external interface will eventually be listening on the ExternalInterfaceQueue, but until the ExternalConsumer is ready to do that, an GapProcess will handle the incoming queue data and move it to the current mode of communication (in this case somewhere on the FileSystem). This dynamic behavior is facilitated using the policy driven routing and transformation capabilities that are part of the JBoss SOA Platform Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).



Figure 2: DAS Interface Architecture Design

When the ExternalConsumer is ready to consume the data from the message queue, the GapProcess will be stopped, leaving the ExternalInterfaceQueue alone as the in-service mechanism for exchanging data between systems. This same pattern holds true for Web-services and other interface mechanisms; just exchange ExternalInterfaceWebService for ExternalInterfaceQueue and the rest of the narrative remains the same. This architecture and design allows for the greatest flexibility in meeting the immediate interface style requirements while enabling future service oriented interface behavior.

The following sections describe the high level architecture and design considerations for each external interface within the scope of the Description and Authority Services solution.

                                      NL Terms and Definitions for Artifact Inventory and Collection Counts

Updated August 29 2008


This document is intended to:

    • Foster uniform terminology addressing artifact collection counts and related methodologies across the Libraries;
    • Provide the basis for uniform counting and for consistent reporting of collection totals;
    • Support museum staff when called on to explain what is behind collection totals, and why these may change as documentation and cataloging
      progresses.


GIFT

The term ‘gift’ is a problematic term when considered across all of the library collections. Gifts given to the President or other recipient -
primarily but not exclusively while the President is in office - comprise a large portion of the NL museum collections. The museums also hold
major deposits of donated historical materials originating with former Presidents, their associates, and the public - also commonly termed
‘gifts’.  White House documentation and other legacy inventories vary in their approach to the problem of item-level accountability.
Administrations from Presidents Truman through Ford tracked gifts to the President using a descriptive index card system.  Once White House Gift
Office databases came into being (beginning with President Carter), each ‘gift’ would be logged in under one identification number, even if it
included multiple items such as multiple copies of a book or complex items such as a large dinner service, in order to facilitate
acknowledgements and reporting.  Likewise, caches of deeded or ‘gifted’ material may be comprised of any number of individual or complex items
received as one donation. Several of the NL museums also inherited inventories created by NARS or other interim custodians, each with its own
descriptive methodology.

In circumstances where a count of museum holdings is needed, confusion arises if there is not clarity as to how holdings are counted and
possibly compared with earlier documentation. The following terms are designed to establish uniform terminology to associate with cataloging and
counting practices in the Presidential library museums:


ARTIFACT

An ‘artifact’ functions as a unit, and may consist of a single item such as a t-shirt or a baseball, or may be a complex item such as a multi-
piece tea service. For complex artifacts, all pieces were generally manufactured or made together, and are intended to be used together (such as
all of the elements of the tea service (one ‘artifact’), or a pair of earrings (one ‘artifact’).  One does not assume that a baseball cap, t-
shirt and a baseball would always be used together even if they were originally given to the President as one ‘gift’.  These are generally
documented in the NL museum collections as three ‘artifacts’.  A single controlled term Item Name can be assigned to an ‘artifact’ (“Suit,
Ladies’” or “Set, Tea”).


OBJECT (MUSEUM OBJECT)

An ‘artifact’ may be of a complex nature, such as the tea set noted above, the elements of which individually constitute an ‘object’.   While
‘object’ refers to the t-shirt or baseball noted above, it would also correlate to each tea cup and saucer in the tea set, or each napkin in a
set of table linens.  An ‘object’ can stand on its own, (one would not necessarily use all of the teacups or all of the napkins at a given
sitting) but is generally intended to be used as part of a greater whole.

NOTE: for purposes of NARA-wide discussion, the term ‘Object’ should be termed ‘Museum Object’ in order to distinguish from ‘Digital Object’ and
other similar terminology operative in the NARA environment.


PIECE

An ‘object’ may also be of a complex nature, such as a teapot with a lid, the elements of which individually constitute a ‘piece.’  While
‘piece,’ refers to the tea cup, napkin, hat or baseball noted above, it would also correlate to any separable part that cannot stand on its own,
such as each teapot and lid in a tea set, or the cap and body of a pen, which must be used as part of a greater whole.  In the case of a framed
item that is separated from its frame, or a broken artifact or object, one might account for the resulting fragment(s) as ‘pieces’, but only if
the individual pieces are to be catalogued and marked as such on a permanent basis.


RECORD (iO Record)

A given Record in the iO Catalog generally documents one ‘artifact’ in the case of single items such as a t-shirt or a baseball. Where complex
artifacts are involved, individual iO records may optionally document ‘PART’ of an artifact (rather than a the ‘WHOLE’) in order to describe and
track complex items at a more detailed level (at the object or piece level). This becomes useful when individual ‘objects’ or ‘pieces’ are
stored separately, develop a unique condition or exhibit history, or vary in their design or decoration enough to require individual physical
description.  Another exception may be duplicate items given as part of a single gift or accession (such as a group of identical lapel pins).
Staff may for convenience sake document these together on one iO record sharing a single, common description, then proceed to create separate
records for individual ‘artifacts’ if one or more of the duplicates is de-accessioned, or develops a unique condition or exhibit history.  The
‘Whole/Part’ field in iO flags atypical records (‘DUPLICATES’, ‘LOT’, ‘PART’, etc.) for easy identification, and can also assist with managing
complex situations such as a pair of earrings that is part of a matching jewelry set (PART – PAIR).

      Presently, a total Artifact Count may be obtained from iO as the number of Permanent Collection records, plus a factor accounting for the
      number of duplicate, lot or other multiple artifact records and minus a factor accounting for multiple PART records which together
      compromise only one WHOLE artifact, and any de-accessions or voided records.  Optionally, an Artifact Count field may be implemented using
      a re-titled optional Number field to auto-count all values entered in the field (see NL Artifacts Working Guidelines #3c as a model).

      A total Object Count may be obtained from iO using a re-titled iO Optional Number field, which auto-totals all the values in that field.
      (see NL Artifacts Working Guidelines #3c).


      A total Piece Count may be obtained from iO using the re-titled iO Item Count field, which auto-totals all the values in that field (see NL
      Artifacts Working Guidelines #3b).

NOTE: For purposes of NARA-wide discussion, the term ‘Record’ should be termed ‘iO Record’ in order to distinguish from ‘Record’ (textual), ‘ARC
Record’ or ‘ARC Description’ and other terminology operative in the ARC environment.

                                                      NARA’s Artifact Risk Assessment Matrix

Background: the risk assessment matrix used for Library artifacts provides standardized terms and term combinations to track  preservation  needs
and prioritize preservation work.  At-Risk data fields include:

   1. Artifact Condition uses the terms Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, and Unstable to document the current condition of the artifact. Entries  are
      made or reconsidered when: the object is inventoried, the object’s condition changes or the object has been  damaged,  when  a  conservator
      (specialist) examines that object, when the object is condition-reported for  loan/exhibit,  if  there  is  a  change  to  the  item  post-
      loan/exhibit, when an item is treated.

   2. Condition Summary allows a free-text description of the current condition, damage or an apparent vulnerability.  Preferred field length  is
      minimum 2000 characters.

   3. Preservation Action lists one or more needed preservation actions (e.g., an object may require storage re-housing as well  as  conservation
      treatment) according to their urgency, using the terms Urgent, Major Treatment, Minor Treatment, Storage/Exhibit Improvements,  Specialized
      Examination, No Preservation Action (needed at this time) (currently entered by number codes  5-1).   Updates  are  made  if  the  object’s
      condition or needs change, and after actions are completed.


   4. Preservation Action Note  (free text field of 500 characters) allows the user to specify the preservation action in more detail.

   5. Curatorial Priority: takes into account the current or anticipated level of use for an artifact as well as its historical, cultural  and/or
      monetary value, and uses the terms Highest Priority, High Priority, Medium Priority, Low Priority, De-accession  Candidate,  Unknown  (more
      research needed).

   6. Risk Level is determined based on the Preservation Action and the Curatorial Priority according to the following matrix:

|NL Artifact Risk Ranking Matrix                                                                                                                  |

|Medium Risk                                  |Any Preservation Action except Urgent or No action|Medium                                           |
|                                             |needed, or any combination thereof                |                                                 |
|Low Risk                                     |Any Preservation Action except Urgent or No action|Low                                              |
|                                             |needed, or any combination thereof                |                                                 |
|No Preservation Action Needed At This Time   |Any value or combination of values except No      |De-Accession Candidate                           |
|                                             |action needed                                     |                                                 |
|                                             |No action Needed                                  |Any value except unknown                         |
|Assessment not complete                      |Any value or combination of values                |Unknown                                          |

Additional Data Fields/Displays are sought:

3 fields to support the Risk Matrix:  Assessed by, Date Assessed, Reason Assessed (expandable  pick  list  (Inventory,  Loan/Exhibit,  Appraisal,
Specialist Exam, etc., with default entry ‘Inventory’)

3 fields to support the management of Curatorial Priorities: Assessed by, Date Assessed, Note (500 characters).

It would be optimal for the Curatorial Priority rating to also display in the main object record.

It would be optimal for the Risk Level  ranking  to  be  auto-generated  by  the  system  any  time  a  new  Preservation  Action  or  Curatorial
Prioritization is entered

Dear Offerors:

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is planning to issue an award for the Museum Collections Management Database.  You are
invited to submit a quotation utilizing Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices for the Archival Description and Authority Tools specified in Enclosure
2, Performance Work Statement (PWS), under Request for Quotation (RFQ) NAMA-11-Q-0050.  The quotation will be submitted in accordance with the
procedures outlined in Enclosure 5, Quote Submission Instructions.

For your quote to be considered responsive, you must submit the following items not later than 3:00 PM EST on July 29, 2011:

     1. CD in a Microsoft Excel software file and four paper copies of the Schedule of Prices (Enclosure 1);
      2.   CD and five paper copies of the past performance information (see Enclosure 5, Paragraph 1.d);
      3.   CD and five paper copies of the personnel resumes (see Enclosure 5, Paragraph 1.a;


      4.    Written preliminary hardware and software requirements to implement the proposed solution.   Submission  will  provide  the  software
        architecture. Estimated hardware and software cost shall be included in Enclosure 1, Schedule Prices.


      5.    Estimated time required to adequately demonstrate the functional requirements  in  section  6  and  attachment  5.   The  lack  of  a
        submission will be assumed that time allotted in enclosure 6(3) (90-minutes) is sufficient.


      6.    Contractor signed certification that solution meets Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN)  Museum  database  standards  and/or
        indicate Spectrum Partnership.


        NOTE: Items 2, 3, and 4 may be on the same CD/volume but must be submitted separate from any pricing data. Also, all electronic data
        must be submitted to the Contract Specialist (CS) by email.

*In order to facilitate the processing of Offeror’s quotations, NARA requests that Offerors submit the Past Performance portion of their
Technical Quotation by July 15, 2010  3:00 P.M. EST, which is approximately two weeks prior to the submission of the remainder of the Quotation
package.

Mr. Michael W. Knowles
Contracting Officer

                                                                   ENCLOSURE 1

                                                                SCHEDULE OF PRICES

NOTE:  Insert unit prices proposed for each CLIN for each year.  The Total Price for each year will be determined by adding the individual CLIN
prices for each year in the tables.  The Total Contract  Price will be determined by summing the yearly Total Prices of the Base Year and all
Option Years.  CLIN = Contract Line Item Number; PWS = Performance Work Statement; NSP = Not Separately Priced; The Government reserves the
right to purchase, throughout the performance period, any combination of optional CLINs at the fixed monthly price in quantities that may be
less than 12 months.  The Offeror must provide optional CLIN personnel within 30 days of notice.

The CLIN descriptions are generic and provided for guidance only, including Government and Client site designations.  Offerors should provide
CLIN descriptions that are commensurate with their individual schedule descriptions and the nature of work to be performed.  Furthermore, should
Offerors deem it necessary to add additional CLINs or Labor Categories in a particular performance period, simply add/enumerate accordingly.
This is a quotation and the Government is interested in the sound business perspective and judgment of the Offerors.  The Government does not
guarantee that it will exercise each CLIN in a given period.

Offerors must provide a schedule in the price quotation that clearly details the breakdown of the proposed monthly prices by labor category,
labor hours, labor rates, materials, equipment, supplies, etc.  All other direct cost (ODC) items other than those provided in the schedule by
the Government must be separately priced, identified, and explained.  The Offeror must clearly identify other ODCs as exceptions to the Schedule
of Prices.  Any ODCs accepted by the Government will be clearly identified in the ODC line item text at award.  Those not included in the text
at award will be excluded by omission.

In addition to hard copy information, in order to expedite review of the quotation, Offerors must submit an electronic copy on CD in a format
compatible with the Microsoft Excel software program.  NARA utilizes these disks during the review of quoted prices for such things as math
checks, the use of correct escalation, and other evaluation procedures.  Offerors must include the formulas and factors used in calculation of
the data.

Not all Base Year CLINs will be funded during the performance period.  Funds for the various phases of the contract will be provided as
required.  Tasks not funded during the base performance period may be funded in subsequent performance periods.

1.    INTRODUCTION

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  NARA is an independent Federal agency that serves the American  democracy  by  safeguarding
and preserving the records of our government, and ensuring that the people can discover, use,  and  learn  from  this  documentary  heritage.  We
ensure continuing access to the essential documentation of the rights of American citizens and  the  actions  of  their  government.  We  support
democracy, promote civic education, and facilitate historical understanding of our national experience.

Presidential Libraries / Office of Presidential Libraries (NL).  The Office  of  Presidential  Libraries  administers  a  nationwide  network  of
Presidential Libraries, currently 13, beginning with the 31st President Herbert Hoover, through the 43rd President George  W.  Bush.   These  are
not traditional libraries, but rather repositories for preserving and making accessible the papers, records, and other  historical  materials  of
U.S. Presidents.  In addition to textual,  audiovisual  and  ‘born  digital’  electronic  records,  the  Presidential  Libraries  hold  in  their
collections a wide variety of artifacts associated with each President’s administration and political and personal  life.   These  materials  are
managed by a dedicated museum staff at each Library, and made available through exhibits, loans and other  programs  drawing  1.5  to  2  million
visitors annually.  Included in the collections are wide variety of Presidential gifts given by officials,  private  organizations  and  citizens
from around the world, artifact materials generated or received during the President’s term,  and  a  wide  range  of  memorabilia  and  personal
materials donated by the President, the President’s family and associates, and the general public.   Individual  object  collections  range  from
9000 to 145,000 artifacts at a given Library, with a current system-wide total of around 650,000 artifacts.   The development and  management  of
descriptive data and other collections records, the physical management of  each  collection,  and  the  development  and  management  of  loans,
exhibits and programs are maintained at each Library  for  their  own  collection  and  audiences,  while  the  Libraries  also  strive  to  meet
professional and agency standards, and strategies and goals for managing NARA holdings and for making these holdings accessible and available  to
the public.

Office of Information Services (NH).  NARA’s Office of  Information  Services  manages  all  matters  relating  to  information  technology  (IT)
programs, projects, processes and infrastructure in NARA.  The Capital Planning Branch (NHPC) plans, directs, and administers NARA's  information
technology (IT) investments throughout their lifecycle. The NHPC Branch is responsible for documenting, executing,  reporting,  and  managing  IT
Capital Planning functions. The Information Technology Services Division  (NHT)  oversees  the  delivery  of  network,  computer,  and  telephone
services across the enterprise.



2.    BACKGROUND

The Presidential Libraries museums currently use the Selago Designs application iO® to perform  automated  cataloging  and  management  of  their
museum collections.  iO® supports a wide range of processes according to professional and NARA standards and methods applicable to two-and three-
dimensional artifact collections.  Functional areas include: object description and cataloging; object classification (Chenhall); association  of
‘other’ tracking numbers and number metadata with object records; management of artifact  life  cycles  (information  associated  with  temporary
deposits, museum acquisitions and de-accessions); unlimited and continuous location, condition, and valuation histories for each object;  exhibit
and loan development and management; comprehensive loan and exhibit histories; authority files  and/or  controlled  term  fields  for  associated
people and subjects/events; comprehensive integration of associated image and document files  with  collections  information  and  processes  and
management of media file metadata and rights information.

The Presidential Library museums currently maintain 16 client-server installations of iO®: 13 at our current library sites, two installations  at
the Presidential Materials Staff in Washington, D.C. (in order to manage material in the custody  of  the  incumbent  President  separately  from
material in NARA’s legal custody), and one installation at the Office of Presidential Libraries used to archive and  review  Library  data  files
for audit and operational support purposes.  A fresh installation is implemented by the Presidential Materials staff when a new President  enters
office, while the retiring President’s holdings and files are received into NARA’s legal custody and integrated into the  development  of  a  new
Library.  Access to each Library’s museum database is presently limited to each Library’s museum collections staff,  with  4  to  8  simultaneous
user licenses per site, and a system-wide total of 73 simultaneous licenses.  Licensing needs are anticipated to grow to 100  simultaneous  users
by 2015.

The implementation of iO® in 1998 allowed Presidential collections staff to automate and  enrich  multiple  business  processes  related  to  the
artifact collections in one database application.  The  establishment  of  an  automated  museum  collections  management  database  (MCMD)  also
supported the development of artifact data standards across the Libraries,  and  advanced  the  use  of  methodologies  that  meet  national  and
international museum standards.  Internally, efforts focused through MCMD processes helped to implement  and  systematize  NARA/NL-defined  tasks
such as artifact inventories and at-risk coding for artifacts.  The implementation greatly reduced the use of  paper  logs  and  forms,  and  the
scattered and improvised use of generic applications to manage artifact-related business processes.

In the intervening years since iO was implemented, demands on the system have considerably  expanded,  especially  with  regards  to  collections
accountability (i.e. demands to step up collection inventories, object photography, and de-accessions), and efforts to implement an artifact  at-
risk matrix and updated NARA exhibit and loan standards and goals – all of which have placed  a  greater  need  for  efficiency  on  our  limited
collections staff. Numerous recommendations to improve the MCMD have been identified through the work of an NL Artifact Data Standards  Committee
active since 2004, input from system users, and extensive market research.  Additionally, NARA seeks to facilitate cross-site data sharing  among
Library museum staff as we enter a period of agency transformation with goals to unify and improve NARA’s  customer  service  capabilities.    As
part of these strategies, NARA seeks to position the Libraries to phase in public sharing of collections data as each Library is  ready,  and  so
seeks an MCMD product for which web publishing tools that are compatible with NARA’s IT architecture, and can be readily  added  to  the  product
package at a future date.

3.    OBJECTIVES

The purpose of the procurement is  to  purchase  and  implement  a  commercial  off-the-shelf  (COTS)  database  application  that  with  minimal
customizations, will bring critical improvements to automated museum collections processes and collections accountability,  further  develop  the
descriptive enrichment and interpretive potential of the collections, and optimize the MCMD resource within NARA’s IT and business  architecture.
  The application must meet professional museum standards as indicated  by  CHIN  and/or  Spectrum  certification.[1]    NARA  seeks  an  optimal
contract package to support the following goals:

   1. Carry forward iO legacy data developed to date; correct deficiencies in application performance for large Library collections (over  50,000
      object records).


   2. Support comprehensive and accreditable management of artifact life cycles within the application, from the courtesy storage  phase  through
      accessioning and potential de-accessioning, without having to overwrite critical legacy information.

   3. Support efficient Presidential Library inventory work processes and reporting, optimize synchronization of  inventory  information  with
      current location and at-risk information, and provide customized support for NARA/NL’s artifact at-risk matrix.

   4. Improve object location and shipment management to support accountability and  efficiency  in  storage,  and  to  better  support  large
      collection shifts and mass moves associated with Presidential transitions and new Library start-ups.

   5. Streamline query and report-building and import/export functions; facilitate sharing of queries/reports within each Library  and  across
      Library sites;

   6. Optimize task management through features such as user-definable workscreens, copy-forward capabilities, and other features such as task
      notifications and step-saving image management.

   7. Support and enrich the integration of image, document and other media  files  with  collections  information  and  processes,  and  with
      associated metadata and rights information.

   8. Build on current authority and descriptive resources developed within the database, facilitate integration with NARA’s  other  authority
      and descriptive resources, and improve capabilities for thematic and keyword searches in order to promote the descriptive enrichment and
      interpretive potential of the collections.

   9. Improve support for loans and exhibits according to current NARA standards; encourage multi-venue strategies.

  10. Place controls on records deleted from the database; improve field audit and user security controls; protect  pii  and  other  sensitive
      information maintained within the database.

  11. Facilitate cross-site, read-only data sharing among system users; position the Libraries to phase in public web  access  of  collections
      data as Libraries are ready.

  12. Further develop Office of Presidential Library  ‘master  list’  audit,  reporting,  and  research  functions,  and  improve  centralized
      operational and data standards support.

  13. Support user training throughout the contract lifecycle.

  14. Update and optimize MCMD system engineering.

associated image files during Presidential Library business hours (8am ET to 5pm PT) with no more than 15 minutes of down time  daily,  and  must
ensure appropriate backup, security, and recovery of the system and its associated data.  Current versions of the  software  must  be  maintained
across all sites, to include patch updates or upgrades.  Upon initial installation of software updates and patches, remaining facilities will  be
brought current within 5 business days.

5.4   The application, the hardware running it, and NARAnet connections must together support the following performance goals:

      a.         Query response time for 500 records no greater than 1 second
      b.    Query response time for 5000 records no greater than 3 seconds
      c.         Query response time for 50,000 records no greater than 7 seconds
      d.    Time to scroll through records with thumbnail display no greater than 1.5 records per second.
      e.    Time to open an image file of access size (800 x 800 pixels up to 1200 pixels x 1200 at 72-ppi) 2 seconds or less
      f.         Time to open an image file up of master size (3000 x 2000 pixels up to 4500 x 3100 pixels at 300 ppi) 3 seconds or less
      g.    Time to return a slide table thumbnail array no greater than 40 images per second


5.5.        MCMD incumbent Presidential data maintained in the physical custody of the Presidential Materials Staff  (NLMS)  is  subject  to  the
statutory protections of the Presidential Records Act (44 U.S.C.2101-2207), and must be sequestered in a unique  database  from  data  in  NLMS’s
legal custody, and all other data in NARA’s legal custody.  The solution will provide functionality  to  restrict  access  to  only  those  users
designated by the Director of the Presidential Materials Staff.

5.6.        Perpetual licenses for 73 simultaneous users are needed at implementation (2-10 per site).   See Attachment 6,  Presidential  Library
Locations and Users.

5.7   The application must have capabilities to handle collections data sets for individual Library collections  ranging  from  9000  to  145,000
objects, and a current system-wide total of around 650,000 objects.  Library data files typically experience about 3% growth  annually.    A  new
library is added to the system every 4 or 8 years, as each President’s term ends, and the data associated with that President comes  into  NARA’s
legal custody.  New collections can range from approximately 40,000 to 85,000 artifacts.

5.8.        Configurations throughout the system must ensure retention of each Library’s control of their  own  user  logins  and  user  security
settings, collections data, loans/exhibits and other locally-controlled business processes.

5.9.        ‘Master List’ capabilities for the Office of Presidential Libraries, College Park,  MD,  to   support  a  comprehensive,  centralized
master catalog of all Library museum collections data, with capabilities to perform read-only queries, reports, and  audits  across  all  library
data files (with the exception of Presidential Library incumbent data). Functions are also sought to  facilitate  centralized  maintenance/update
to user help data available within the database, and centralized management/development of  authority  fields/functions.    Master  catalog  data
must be updated at least quarterly, and should be able to be accomplished remotely.  More  frequent  updates,  such  as  daily,  or  ‘real  time’
connectivity would be preferable, but will be weighed against the cost.   Master  catalog  functionality  must  not  take  priority  over  system
performance from the Library users’ perspective.   See related Functional Requirements under 6.17.

5.10.       Capabilities to support read-only data searching/viewing across Library  sites  (excluding  Presidential  Materials  Staff  incumbent
data) and the Office of Presidential Libraries on a read-only basis, with access controls determined/controlled by each  site.   Ease  of  future
interface with public internet, handhelds or other media for selected data is also desirable for future phase planning –  see  Functional  Option
13.c (Attachment 5).

5.11.       If the application solution includes a web browser, it must be compatible with NARA-supported web  browsers  (currently  Firefox  and
Internet Explorer).

5.12. The application must have data update capabilities via NARA network LAN and WAN,  wired  and  wireless,  at  each  Library  site,  and  the
Presidential Materials Staff site.

5.13. Associated image files are currently about 500 GB, projected to grow to 28TB by 2015.  Most individual image files range from about  .5  to
2 MB, with about 8% in the 2-8 MB range, and a few isolated caches of higher resolution  images  created  for  special  projects.   Users  access
multiple images simultaneously.  The solution will support easy access storage/links on associated MCMD servers for initial image  download  from
digital cameras or scanners, initial image manipulation, and upload of thumbnails to the database, and storage/links for large master  image  and
less-used files on NARA’s SAN.  Additionally the solution will support Digital Asset Management within the system,  or  integrate  with  external
products (e.g. EMC Documentum®) (see Functional Option 7.9.a).

6.    FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

6.1   Application Standards

The COTs application must be certified by the Canadian Heritage Information Network (CHIN) and/or be Spectrum-compliant  or  a  Spectrum  Partner
(see footnote 1, above).
6.2   Carry-forward / Migration of iO® Legacy Data

iO operates in the following functional areas: object naming, description and cataloging suitable for a very wide variety of  material  artifacts
and origins; documentation of inscriptions, physical measurements, material composition, and provenance; object classification according  to  the
Chenhall thesaurus; tracking of ‘other’ numbers and number metadata; control of object entry, and documentation of  ownership  and  legal  status
information associated with temporary deposits, acquisitions, and de-accessions (object life cycles); maintenance  of  unlimited  and  continuous
location, condition/preservation, and valuation histories for each object; exhibit and loan development; maintenance of continuous and  unlimited
exhibit and loan histories for each object; development of  authorities for associated people and subjects/events; comprehensive  integration  of
associated media/image and document files with collections  information  and  processes;  and  management  of  media  file  metadata  and  rights
information.  Comprehensive iO data structure, data link and button lists will be provided prior to data conversion with the prior permission  of
Selago Designs, Inc.
The Contractor must convert each instance of existing NARA data from the iO® application to the  Contractor’s  application.   NARA  will  provide
Contractor with Library data files on a schedule according the approved Project Management Plan (See Task 1 (Section 8),  and  Deliverable  1.a).
The utilization of iO® data fields is generally uniform throughout the system, with some minor differences in how a  Library  may  have  purposed
optionable data fields, or how they may have chosen some fields for data deployment.

As an important part of the data migration process, NARA’s COTR will work with the Contractor to develop a cross-map, and to  adjust  the  cross-
map to each Library’s data as needed prior to each  conversion.   The  Contractor   must  alert  NARA  to  areas  where  legacy  data  will  need
reconfiguration, such as combined field assignments, areas where inter-module links may be un-retainable, or if to the best of  the  Contractor’s
knowledge, any data truncation, corruption, or loss is likely, and/or what follow-up  manual  data  entry  or  clean-up  will  be  needed.    The
Contractor is responsible for full documentation of each conversion (See Tasks 3, 4 (Section 8) and Deliverables 3.a, 4.a).


6.3.  Object Entry / Management

a.    The system must ensure each Library’s unique ID numbers sequences (i.e. control re-entry of each unique number),  and  report  rejected  or
marked-duplicate ID numbers upon import (see related item 6.13.j).  Note that object ID numbers and Loan numbers may repeat across sites.


b.    The system must be capable of accepting and distinguishing a wide variety of ID number formats used across the Libraries (i.e.  large/small
caps, spaces, dots, dashes, use of multiple prefixes, etc).  ID numbers may include up to 7 components, and up to  7  characters  per  component,
e.g. examples:  MO 63.3994a-b (Kennedy Library) 1993.4108585.100.a.-.b, (Clinton Library), TEMP.PM.110.4.1.a-b-.5.a-b (Nixon Library).

c.    The system must be capable of automatically parsing ID number  sub-components  and  backfilling  component  zeros,  or  provide  equivalent
mechanism(s) to automate/facilitate indexing, and to minimize errors fostered by manual approaches to sorting/indexing issues.

d.    The system must be able configure ‘parent/child records’ or otherwise coherently associate and manage whole/part associations  for  complex
artifacts, and accommodate unique physical description, measurements, location, exhibit/loan  and  condition  history  of  component  parts  with
minimal steps or keystrokes.


e.    The system must be able to document multiple (5 or more) ‘other numbers’ associated with an object  record,  together  with  an  associated
number type and note.

6.4   Object Life Cycles

a.    The system must be able to document and track a continuous object  life  cycle  from  temporary  deposit/courtesy  storage  status  through
accessioning and de-accessioning/disposal according to established museum collection standards  without  over-writing  legacy  information,  i.e.
retain this information for the permanent record.  At minimum, dedicated fields are needed for the following:
      • A temporary deposit’s temporary number, legal status, owner, purpose, instrument/terms  of  deposit,  copyright  status,  deposit  date,
        return date, and a credit line;
      • An accession’s legal status and collection assignment, physical receipt date (deposit date), accession date, acquisition  method  (gift,
        bequest, end-of-term deposit, etc), donor/source, acquisition instrument/terms, and copyright status and a credit line;
      • For each de-accession a reason, de-accession date, disposal date, disposition (disposal method) and disposition contact, and a means  to
        permanently retire the ID/accession number.
      • See related Functional option 2.a (Attachment 5)

b.    An authorized individual must be able to modify object ID numbers once created and saved, in order to facilitate status/ID  changes  to  an
already-established object record.

c.    The system must be  able  to  document  depositors/donors  in  centralized  (authority)  records  with  biographical  and  other  authority
information, and to distinguish Library donors from ‘gifters’[2] via assignment of distinct authority file roles or flags (see also 6.9.b).

d.    Data fields are needed to record White House provenance information in a searchable/sortable manner;  including  gift  category  (Domestic,
Head of State, Domestic Staff, pre-Presidential, etc.), date presented or arrived, date logged (in Gift Unit  or  other),  gift  recipient  (pick
list President, First Lady, etc), and White House or other associated remarks.  This information is integral to Library acquisition  information.



e.    The system should be able to be able to scope record queries to only the permanent collection and/or to include temporary deposit,
incoming loan, or de-accessioned records as needed using minimal steps or keystrokes.

6.5   Inventory Support

a.    The system must be able to maintain inventory information as a continuous, unlimited history.

b.    Fields and functions are sought to support and streamline NL inventory work processes (see also 6.13.b.  regarding  user-customizable  task

location), inventoried by/date (team initials and FYxx Qx (some sites add the day date)), inventory cycle (100%  Inventory,  Re-Inventory  1,  2,
etc., Annual Inventory). [3]  An inventory note and/or optionable fields/flags are needed  to  record  local  remarks  and/or  to  support  local
inventory reconciliations (see also 6.12.e regarding optionable fields/flags).

c.    Each site must be able to query and report inventory results by quarter, fiscal year, and cycle, and simultaneously report progress on  at-
risk assessments (see 6.8.b) carried out during inventories using minimal steps.  See related Functional option 3.a (Attachment 5).

d.    Reporting must support Office of Presidential Libraries requirements to compile and  report  forward  system-wide  numbers  and  percentage
progress within current inventory cycles,  evolutions  in  collection  counts,  and  progress  identifying  and  resolving  inventory  anomalies,
coordinated with reporting on at-risk assessments and results.

e.    The system must be able to generate a random selection of object records for periodic internal inventory audits.   See  related  Functional
option 3.b (Attachment 5).


f.    The system must be able to mark/flag artifacts designated by the staff as ‘valuable/vulnerable’, for easy identification and recovery,  and
restrict who may add or change a v/v mark/flag.

g.    The system must be able to document/sum and report collection counts according to NL artifact-object-piece standards (see Attachment 7,
Presidential Library Terms and Definitions for Collection Counts, and refine such counts with other query parameters (e.g. report current
permanent collection count, report a count per a storage location, per an at-risk category, etc.).  This is currently accomplished through use
of dedicated user-entered fields for the object count and piece count which can be summed within the database.




6.6   Object Locations, Movement and Shipment Control

a.    The system must be able to document and permanently retain unlimited location and object movement histories, to record  the  object’s  home
location (see related Functional option 4.a (Attachment 5)), the object’s current location, the date the object  arrived  at  the  location,  who
made the location change, location type (storage, prep, exhibit, etc), storage unit  type  (shelf,  cabinet,  tray,  rolled,  rack,  bin,  etc.),
special storage requirements, and a location note.


b.    The system must be able to support indexing/sorting, and querying of multi-level locations (e.g. shelf, box/container, unit/cabinet,
storage bay, room, truckload, etc., according to the user’s design), and to facilitate batch location updates (e.g. simultaneously update the
location for a multi-object storage or shipping container) using minimal steps or keystrokes within the database.  These features are needed to
support routine shifts in collection storage, larger collection shifts carried out during facility/storage renovations, and periodic mass moves
undertaken during Presidential transitions to new temporary sites, and mass moves from temporary to new Library sites.

c.    The system must be able to generate packing and container lists and to support documentation and management of object shipments, e.g. to
record information about the shipper/contact, costs, crate dimensions, tracking numbers, etc.

d.    The system must provide full audit trails on location information creation and modification.

6.7   Object Description, Cataloging and Valuations

a.    Data fields are needed to support description and contextualization for a great variety of objects and origins, to systematically  document
measurements data, inscriptions and markings information; object maker or manufacturer and/or place/culture of origin, and to  record  an  object
common name and title.  See also 6.8.d. regarding materials information, 6.9.e. regarding thesaural classifications  according  to  the  Chenhall
system, and Functional option 5.a (Attachment 5) regarding documenting frames and adjunct items.


b.    The system must be able to record an object’s maker/manufacturer as a centralized (authority) record with biographical and other  authority
information.

c.    The system must be able to record a primary physical  description,  plus  additional  purpose-based  descriptions  for  interpretive/access
purposes (e.g. web description, label texts, etc), either as a repeatable description field set and/or via attachment of external documents.  See
related Functional option 5.b. (Attachment 5).

d.    The system should provide a field to record  a  descriptive  (historical)  note,  and  to  capture  subject/keyword  and  historical  event
references/terms in a manner that can be standardized and indexed (see also 6.9.d).


e.    A data field is needed to note/reference other associated objects in the Library’s museum or other collections.

f.    The system must be able to document a continuous, unlimited history of valuations placed on individual  objects,  including  who  performed

selected fields with minimal steps.

j.    For records that fail validation upon import (e.g. the format is unacceptable, ID numbers duplicate records already in the system, or  data
may be truncated), the system produces and error report, or tags/holds these records for user verification.  The system should allow  the  bypass
of field validation during import.

See related Functional options 10.a-c (Attachment 5).

6.14  Queries and Reports

a.    Functions are sought to streamline query and report-building and import/export functions, and to share  user-built  queries/reports  within
each Library and across Library site.  See related item under 6.4.e.

b.    The system must be able to accept boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, partial term keyword or ‘wildcard’ searches  (term*,  *term  or  *term*);
integer, date and currency < or > queries; and to search for the presence or absence of data, or offer  equivalent  functions.   Capabilities  to
conduct simultaneous, multi-field keyword searches are sought.


c.    The system must allow results from queries to be named and saved for future use.


d.    System capabilities are sought for the user to be able to browse forward and backward through records  returned  by  queries  and  to  view
query results as a grid-style list, sort query results by any field included in the query, and refine or narrow existing search results with  new
search criteria.

e.    As part of the system’s report-building capabilities, the system should offer a selection of pre-built ‘starter’ reports that the user  can
modify as needed (select different fields, reformat, resort), and be able to save modified reports and user-built reports for future use.   Users
should be able to specify image files to be integrated into  a  report,  to  manipulate  their  placement  within  the  report,  and  to  specify
header/footer information for a report. The report generator must be able to automatically generate and display in a report the date  the  report
was generated, and to offer capabilities for the user to calculate totals or subtotals for number  and  currency  fields  (e.g.  total  insurance
value for listed objects).

f.    Capabilities are sought to be able to load and populate NARA form templates (e.g. NARA loan agreement, NARA outgoing  receipt)  within  the
system; at minimum to incorporate Library and NARA logos into a user-built version of the  NARA  form  that  can  be  designed  using  comparable
formatting and texts.

See related Functional options 11.a-f (Attachment 5).

6.15  Application Security

a.    A System Administrator at each Library must be able must be able to customize privileges to system  logins,  to  select  by  user  who  may
access/view or update sensitive  information  fields  (e.g.  object  valuation  information,  valuable/vulnerable  status  flags,  deed  of  gift
information, and pii information (street addresses and dates of birth), and to set audit trail requirements for data modules and fields.

b.    The SA at each Library must be able to select by user who may change ID numbers, delete records and finalize/verify location changes.

c.    The system must be able to archive all deleted records for review by an SA-authorized individual, shall request ‘are  you  sure’  before  a

regarding scheduling/management of audit data.

6.16  Data Sharing

An SA at each Library site should be able to select records and data fields, as well as associated images that are accessible via visitor  logins
for searching and viewing on a read-only basis by other Presidential Library application users.  Visitors should be able to  print  results  from
data searches from the screen, but users must be able to control/restrict image printing capabilities.
See related Functional options 13.a-c (Attachment 5).

6.17  Central Office Functions


a. The Office of Presidential Libraries maintains a comprehensive ‘master archives’ of museum collections information  in  Washington,  D.C.  for
oversight, audit, and program planning purposes, and seeks to enhance/develop these functions further, to include review  of   library-level  and
system-wide inventory results (e.g. quarterly, annual, cyclical), library and system-wide collection counts, reporting of new accessions and  de-
accessions, monitoring of user logs, and monitoring of Library management of deleted records and audit data.



Additional functions of interest  include the  ability  --  on  a  periodic  (e.g.  quarterly,  monthly)  or  continual  basis  --  to  centrally
manage/update help features within the database; to review, compare and update authority lists and thesauri; and to  perform  cross-file  keyword

                                                               TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1.0   ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI)

    a.      The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that:


           i.  The Offeror’s objectivity and judgment are not biased because of its present, or currently planned interests, (financial,
           contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to work under this purchase order;


           ii.  The Offeror does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage by virtue of its access to non-public information regarding the
           Government’s program plans and actual or anticipated resources; and


           iii.  The Offeror does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage by virtue of its access to proprietary information belonging to
           others.


    b.      In order to preclude an organizational conflict of interest, the Offeror will not be permitted to bid upon or otherwise become a
    Offeror or subcontractor (except where the Offeror is a sole source) for any other IT related contract awarded by NARA during the term of
    this IT support contract (or for any particular IT related procurement action, which in this case primarily involves requirements definition,
    the Offeror was involved in during this IT support contract period but awarded after the expiration of this IT support contract) except in
    the following circumstances.

    c.      Prior to working on a particular IT project per the terms of the PWS that might result in a NARA IT procurement (defined as any
    procurement that is part of the NARA IT Environment even if only tangentially related), the Offeror may request to be allowed to bid upon, as
    Offeror or subcontractor, or otherwise perform work on another NARA IT contract.  At the CO's discretion, following consultation with the
    COR, the Offeror may receive permission to bid or perform such work. If the Contracting Officer determines that the particular IT project
    requires the Offeror’s performance or the Offeror has already performed more than negligible work on that IT project, then the Contracting
    Officer will not approve the Offeror’s request.  If the IT project does not require the Offeror’s performance and no work or negligible work
    has been performed, the Contracting Officer may approve the Offeror’s request to bid upon or perform work on another NARA contract. The
    Offeror(s) awarded this contract are explicitly prohibited from providing any management, design, development, integration, training,
    operations, or maintenance tasks or contract with any NARA entity for the completion of such tasks unless the Offeror has received prior
    approval by the Contracting Officer.

    d.      It is understood that the Offeror, including all subcontractors and consultants, shall comply with the provisions of Federal
    Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. The Offeror must submit a Mitigation Plan as to how it
    proposes to handle a Conflict of Interest, which will be addressed prior to award.  In general, the Mitigation Plan will include a firewall
    arrangement so that the Offeror will not obtain unfair access to nonpublic information. The Mitigation Plan must provide for the
    organizational, physical and electronic separation of personnel supporting NARA from the Offeror’s other business units or from the proposing
    unit.  Should the Offeror have an existing order or contract with NARA, it is in NARA's sole discretion to allow the Offeror to participate
    in the competition for this award as the size and complexity of the existing order or contract may preclude the Offeror from providing viable
    service to NARA, per the terms of this PWS, in an environment with a properly executed firewall in place.  Among other things, the Mitigation
    Plan must address: (1) the support the Offeror is providing agencies supported by NARA, (2) types of non-IT related services to NARA
    customers, (3) a continuous education program, (4) nondisclosure agreements, (5) document control, and (6) audits at regular intervals.  The
    Offeror must immediately notify NARA of any NARA acquisitions on which the Offeror plans to submit a quotation.  As part of the Mitigation
    Plan, and semi-annually throughout contract performance, the Offeror must submit to NARA a complete updated listing of on-going contracts it
    has with NARA and any known future NARA procurements in which the Offeror is interested.

    e.      If the Contractor, in the performance of this contract, obtains access to information such as plans, policies, reports, studies,
    financial plans, or data which has not been released or otherwise made available to the public, the Contractor agrees that without prior
    written approval of the Contracting Officer, it will not:  (a) use such information for any private purposes unless the information has been
    released or otherwise made available to the public, (b) compete for work based on such information for a period of one year after the
    completion of this contract, or until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public, whichever occurs first, (c)
    submit an unsolicited quotation to the Government which is based on such information until one (1) year after such information is released or
    otherwise made available to the public, or (d) release such information unless such information has previously been released or otherwise
    made available to the public by the Government.

    f.      If, under this contract, the Contractor gains access to proprietary or source selection information of other companies in performing
    advisory assistance services for the Government, the Contractor agrees to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure and to
    refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.  A separate agreement will be entered into
    between the Offeror and the company whose proprietary information is the subject of this restriction.  A copy of this agreement must be
    provided to the Offeror Officer.

    g.      The Offeror will include this or substantially the same clause, including this paragraph, in consulting agreements and subcontracts
    of all tiers.  The terms “contract,” “Offeror,” and “Contracting Officer” will be appropriately modified to preserve the Government’s rights.



    h.      The Offeror represents that is has disclosed to the Contracting Officer, prior to award, all facts relevant to the existence of
    organizational conflict of interest as that term is used in FAR Subpart 9.5.  The Offeror represents that if it discovers any organizational
    conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest after award, a prompt and full disclosure must be made in writing to the Contracting
    Officer.  This disclosure must include a description of the action the Offeror has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid or mitigate
    such conflicts.

    i.      Prior to Contract modification, when the work statement is changed to add new work or the period of performance is significantly
    increased, the Contracting Officer will request and the Offeror is required to submit either an organizational conflict of interest
    disclosure or an update of the previously submitted disclosure or representation.


2.0   KEY PERSONNEL

   a. The Contractor agrees to assign to the Contract the key personnel whose resumes were submitted to fill the requirements of the Contract.
      No substitution or addition of personnel will be made except in accordance with this clause.


   b. The Contractor agrees that during the first 12 months of the Contract period, no personnel substitutions will be permitted, unless such
      substitutions are necessitated by an individual’s sudden illness, death, or termination of employment.  In any of these events, the
      Contractor must promptly notify the Contracting Officer/COR and provide the information required by paragraph (d) below.


   c. If key personnel, for whatever reason, become unavailable for work under this Contract for a continuous period exceeding thirty (30)
      working days, or are expected to devote substantially less effort to the work than indicated in its Quotation, the Contractor must propose
      a substitution of such personnel, in accordance with paragraph (d) below.


   d. All proposed key personnel substitutions must be submitted, in writing, to the Contracting Officer/COR at least fifteen (15) days prior to
      the proposed substitution.  Each request must provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitution,
      a complete resume for the proposed substitute and any other information required by the Contracting Officer to approve or disapprove the
      proposed substitution(s). Resumes for key personnel substitutions must be submitted in Contractor format. All proposed substitutes (no
      matter when they are proposed during the performance period) must have qualifications that are equal to or higher than the qualifications
      of the person being replaced.


   e. In the event the Contractor designates additional key personnel as deemed appropriate for the requirement, the Contractor must submit to
      the Contracting Officer for approval the information required in paragraph (d) above.


   f. The Contracting Officer will evaluate requests for substitution and addition of personnel and promptly notify the Contractor, in writing,
      whether a request is approved or disapproved.


   g. If the Contracting Officer determines that suitable and timely replacement of key personnel who have been reassigned, terminated, or have
      otherwise become unavailable to perform under the Contract is not reasonably forthcoming, or that a resultant reduction of productive
      effort would impair the successful completion of the Contract, the Contract may be terminated by the Contracting Officer for default or for
      the convenience of the Government, as appropriate.  Alternatively, at the Contracting Officer’s discretion, if the Contracting Officer
      finds the Contractor to be at fault for the condition, she may equitably adjust (downward) the Contract price to compensate the Government
      for any delay, loss or damage as a result of the Contractor’s action.

3.0   STANDARDS OF CONDUCT

  a.  The Offeror will be responsible for maintaining satisfactory standards of employee competency, conduct, appearance, and integrity. The
     Offeror is also responsible for ensuring that its employees and those of its subcontractor(s) do not disturb papers on desks, open desk
     drawers or cabinets, use Government telephones, except as authorized, or otherwise jeopardize the security and the privacy of Government
     employees, its clientele, and the contents and property of the federal building(s) in which the Contract work is performed. Each employee
     or supervisor of the Offeror is expected to adhere to standards of behavior that reflect credit on themselves, their employer, and the
     Federal Government.

  b.  The Offeror will be responsible for taking such disciplinary action, including suspension without pay or removal from the worksite, with
     respect to its employees, as may be necessary to enforce those standards.


  c.  Where applicable, the requirements of this clause must be expressly incorporated into subcontract(s) and must be applicable to all
     subcontractor employees who may perform recurring services or work at the federal building and grounds of this Contract.


  d.  The Government retains the right to permanently remove any employee of the Offeror from performing duties assigned under this Contract at
     the federal building should the employee’s performance so warrant. The Government will request the Offeror to immediately remove any
     employee of the Offeror from the federal building/work-site should it be determined by the Contracting Officer that the individual employee
     of the Offeror is “unsuitable” for security reasons or for otherwise being found to be unfit for performing his assigned duty at a federal
     building.  The following areas (not all-inclusive) are considered justification for requesting the Offeror to immediately remove an
     employee from a federal building/work site:


           (i) Neglect of assigned duty and refusing to render assistance or cooperate in upholding the integrity of the security programs at
            the worksite;
           (ii) Falsification or unlawful concealment, removal, mutilation, or destruction of any official documents or records, or concealment
            of material facts by willful omissions from official documents or records;
           (iii) Disorderly conduct, use of abusive or offensive language, quarreling, intimidation by words or actions, or fighting;
            participation in disruptive activities which interfere with the normal and efficient operations of the Government;
           (iv) Theft, vandalism, immoral conduct, or any other criminal actions;
           (v) Selling, consuming, or being under the influence of intoxicants, drugs, or controlled substances which produce similar effects;
           (vi) Improper use of official authority or credentials, as a supervisor or employee of the Offeror;
           (vii) Violation of Agency and Offeror security procedures and regulations; and
           (viii) Violation of the rules and regulations governing federal public buildings and grounds, set forth in 41 CFR Part 102-74,
           Subpart C, Conduct on Federal Property.


   e. Following a recommendation from an agency program official or security officer, the Contracting Officer will make all determinations
     regarding the removal of any employee of the Contractor from and denial/termination of clearance and access to the federal building
     worksite for non-performance, misconduct, or failure to abide by all laws and regulations. The Contracting Officer will verbally inform the
     Offeror about the employee, followed by a written confirmation or determination. Specific reasons for the removal of an employee will be
     provided to the Offeror in writing. In the event of a dispute, the Contracting Officer will make a final determination.


  f.  Upon a determination of the Government that an employee of the Offeror be removed from or denied access to a federal building worksite,
     the employee’s clearance and access to the federal building must be immediately revoked or otherwise terminated. Furthermore, if
     applicable, the building pass and/or other access device(s) previously given to the employee must be immediately surrendered, returned, or
     delivered to the security officer of the federal building.


  g.  During the course of this contract, the Offeror may come into contact with data files subject to the Privacy Act.  If this situation
     occurs, Privacy Act data must conform to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended.  The Offeror also may come into contact with
     confidential documents and confidential information about documents and proposed Federal Agency actions. The Offeror, including Offeror’s
     personnel, Subcontractors, and consultants must not divulge or release data or information developed or obtained in performance of this
     task except to authorized Government personnel or upon written approval of the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor must not use, disclose,
     or reproduce proprietary data, which bears a restrictive legend, other than as required in the performance of this task.  The limitations
     above do not apply to data or information that has been made public by the Government.


4.0   IDENTIFICATION/BUILDING PASS

The Offeror shall make its personnel available for photo identification badges on a schedule to be determined by the Contracting Officer’s
Representative (COR).  The badges will be made by the Government utilizing supplies, materials and equipment provided by the Government.  Each

badges at all times they are present on-duty in the building.  Refusal or repeated neglect to display the photo-identification may result in an
unsuitable determination.

(c)   Upon termination, resignation or other event leading to a contract employee leaving duty under this contract, the Offeror is responsible
for returning all Government identification, building passes, keys, and other Government property issued to that employee. Failure on the part
of the Offeror may result in the Offeror's liability for all costs associated with correcting the resultant breech in building security.

Inquiries" (NACI) level.  Offeror personnel with access to NARA Desktop Common Productivity Tools shall also be required to comply with this
requirement.  The Government may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and grant temporary access to employees of the Offeror and its
subcontractors.  However, the granting of temporary access to any such employee will not be considered as assurance that full suitability

for processing these forms and adjudicating the results of the investigations.  If the Government receives an unsuitable report on any employee
after processing these forms, the Offeror will be advised immediately that such employee cannot continue to work, or be assigned to work, under
this contract.  Offerors, who hire employees investigated and determined suitable during employment with preceding Offerors, are not required to
submit another set of these forms, if the employee has been determined suitable within the past three (3) years, unless specifically requested
to do so by the COR.

where persons other than authorized users, and for other than authorized purpose, have access or potential access to personally identifiable
information, in usable form whether physical or electronic.
“Personally identifiable information (PII)” means any information that permits the identity of an individual to be directly or indirectly
inferred, including any other information that is linked or linkable to that individual regardless of whether the individual is a citizen of the
United States, legal permanent resident, or a visitor to the United States.  Examples of PII include the following:
        1) Name.
        2) Date of birth.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
-
(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;
(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a
proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the
Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax
liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax
liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial
appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requires Prospective Contractors to make an oral presentation to NARA officials for the
purposes of assuring that the prospective Contractor fully understands and has the capability to meet or exceed all the requirements of the
Performance Work Statement.  NARA will incorporate the oral presentation into the delivery order.


   1. Scheduling

The time frame for the oral presentations will be determined by the Contracting Officer (CO), which will begin five working days after the
closing date for receipt of quotations.  Contractors will be allowed to request a date and time for oral presentations within a specific time
frame.  The CO will draw lots to determine the order in which Contractors will make the presentations when two or more Contractors request the
same time period.  Contractors must complete the presentations on the scheduled date and time.  Requests from Contractors to reschedule the
presentations will not be entertained and presentations will not be rescheduled unless deemed necessary by the Government.  The Government
reserves the right to reschedule a Contractor’s oral presentation at the discretion of the CO.  The oral presentations will be made at the:

      National Archives and Records Administration

   2. Content of the Presentation

The Program Manager selected by the Contractor for the proposed work must give the oral presentation, in person, to the Government to
demonstrate that the Contractor’s proposed solution meets or exceeds NARA’s requirements as detailed in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).
The oral presentation must not include any price or cost information.  However, resource information such as data concerning labor hours,
categories, material, and subcontracts must be contained in the presentation so that the Contractor’s understanding of the PWS can be evaluated.
 The Contractor must address the topics in the following order:

   a) Technical Approach.  At a minimum the Contractor must demonstrate the Contractor’s technical experience, technical understanding, and the
      manner in which the proposed solution meets or exceeds the requirements of the PWS.  A series of workflow documents are included as
      Attachment 1 to assist in your understanding of NARA’s processes.
   b) Personnel.  The oral presentation must describe the qualifications, technical experience on similar tasks, familiarity with planning
      processes, and suitability of the Contractor’s proposed Program Manager.
   c) Relevant Past Performance.  The Contractor must discuss relevant past performance on related or similar Federal, State and Local Government
      and private contracts and subcontracts the Contractor has held within the last five years, and all contracts and subcontracts currently in
      progress which are of similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is detailed in the Request for Quotation.  The information
      must be clear as to whether the work by the Contractor was done as a prime Contractor or as a subcontractor.

   3. Structure of the Oral Presentation

The oral presentation time limit is defaulted to 90 minutes however contractors will be notified of demonstration time after the receipt of
quotes. During the presentation, the Government’s attendees will not interrupt the Contractor to ask questions (except to request the repetition
of inaudible words or statements or the explanation of terms that are unknown to them) or otherwise engage the Contractor in any dialogue.
Following the Contractor’s oral presentation, a 30 minute break will be taken.  The break will be followed by a question and answer period not
to exceed 90 minutes during which the Government may ask questions and seek clarifications of certain aspects of quotations.  Contractor may not
use any unused Q&A time to provide new information or revise information.

The Contractor is invited to pre-configure the application demo with sample records and to include in the demonstration the  system  transactions
described in Attachment # 5, System Demonstrations.  These suggestions  will  allow  the  Contractor  to  present  candidate  applications  using
familiar data and typical database functions performed in the  Presidential  Library  museum  collections  databases,  and  to  highlight  common
challenges for users.

Contractors are hereby notified that Oral Presentation will be taped in their entirety.  Taping includes the initial presentation  and  the  time
allotted for question and answer.  Audio visual recordings will be maintained in the contract file and  may  be  incorporated  in  the  resulting
contract.

The Contractor may use slides to make his/her presentation.  There is no limit to the number of slides that a Contractor may use during its oral
presentation.  HOWEVER, THE CONTRACTOR IS CAUTIONED, WHEN EVALUATING THE CONTRACTOR’S PRESENTATION, THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONSIDER AND EVALUATE

[2] A library ‘gifter’ is the source or origin of a gift given to the President or other recipient, which subsequently becomes part of Library
holdings via end-of-term transfer or private donation, as distinguished from a Library ‘donor’ (the source or origin of a direct gift or bequest
to a Library).
[3] a) Libraries must perform a baseline 100% Inventory and reconcile the inventory with Library legacy records within a 5-year period; then b)
maintain subsequent Re-Inventory  cycles (Re-Inventory 1, 2, etc) per the collection size (< 25k objects on a 5-year cycle, 25k – 50k objects on
an 8-year cycle, >50 k objects on a 10-year cycle); and c) conduct an Annual inventory of all artifacts flagged ‘valuable/vulnerable’  (v/v).
[4] NARA requires that light sensitive holdings be limited to no more than one year of display-related light exposure every ten years.
[5] NARA does not undertake to manage rights licenses, but needs to record and be able to manage and share rights information needed to support
internal sharing and public web access to collection images.


System Demonstrations

The demonstration should include a comprehensive walk-through of the system’s capabilities and features (see Section 6), and with references to
related Functional Options (Section 7) and to the below-described transactions as applicable at an appropriate point in the demonstration.

It is suggested that the following test records be pre-loaded into the system, with additional test records added as desired by the Contractor.
 The following examples represent collection objects a hypothetical “President James L. Smith Presidential Library and Museum”, Scottsdale,
Arizona, which holds materials for the President’s two terms (1985 to 1989 and 1989 to 1992), as well as privately-donated pre- and post-
Presidential materials.  It is suggested that the first two object records be entered into the database as part of the system demonstration in
order to exhibit the object entry process.  Changes of status for examples 3 and 5 should also be reserved for the actual demonstration.
