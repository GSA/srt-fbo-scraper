The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights-- (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. (b) Assignment.

The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. (f) Excusable delays.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT. (2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. (h) Patent indemnity. The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings.

(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. (6) Interest. (i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due.

(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if-- (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt within 30 days; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see 32.607-2). (iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on-- (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (j) Risk of loss.

(k) Taxes. The contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and local taxes and duties. (l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. (n) Title. Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

Indexing information about a document, so it can be identified. This helps to replace entering the information at the key pad, and the barcodes replaces this. The barcode has the information imbedded by typing in the relevant data at the user's computer, a bar code is printed that captures the relevant information and then is placed on top of the stack to be scanned. iPERMS requires certain information on the person uploading the files to properly index. 13.1.6. Upon delivery of the file to the folder, the proposed solution must have the ability to provide an email notification to the user that the scan has been successful. 13.1.7. Must provide full audit trail data on all documents scanned from the Device, including username, date/time stamp, page count, workflow metadata, and IP address of device. The proposed solution must also provide a dashboard interface (this is a way of tracking users, what services they are using by using pie charts and bar graphs to quickly determine what services and how frequently or with what volume that are being used. Presents information in a way that is easy to access and easily assess.) For summarized reporting metrics (e.g. page counts by user, page counts by IP address, page counts by workflow etc.) 13.1.8 The proposed solution must be able to provide an integrated scan capability into the Army National Guard's iPERMS system to accelerate the processing of HR documents for HR processing. The iPERMS MFD on-ramping system should lock down scan profiles to 300 DPI, TIFF GROUP IV, B/W, and capture the metadata values of the Soldier's Name, Document Type, and Document Date. The Soldier's Name should be auto-populated based on a CAC log-in, and cannot be changed unless the device is registered by IP address (i.e. devices in HR can change this setting). The scanned document should be sent to the HR network share and placed in a folder based on the soldier name, with the filename automatically renamed based on the Soldier Name, Document Type and Document Date. The proposed solution must provide integration capabilities with fax servers, so that outbound faxes from the MFD, in conjunction with user authentication, will have full audit trails of (a) who faxed a document, (b) where they faxed the document, and (c) a copy of the faxed document placed in a network share or ECM system such as SharePoint. The audit trails must be stored in an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) compliant datasource.

1. PURPOSE This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is a Government developed and applied document used to make sure that systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of the Performance Based Statement of Work (PWS) standards that will be included in the contract. The intent is to ensure that the Contractor performs in accordance with performance metrics set forth in the contract documents, that the Government receives the quality of services called for in the contract and that the Government only pays for the acceptable level of services received. 2. AUTHORITY Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under FAR 52.212-4(a), Inspection/Acceptance, and FAR 52.212-4(m), Termination for cause, and documentation called for in the contract to be accomplished by the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative. 3. SCOPE The QASP is put in place to provide Government surveillance oversight of the Contractor's quality control efforts to assure that they are timely, effective and are delivering the results specified in the contract 4. GOVERNMENT RESOURCES The following definitions for Government resources are applicable to this plan: Contracting Officer ­ A person duly appointed with the authority to enter into, administer, or terminate contracts and make related determination and findings on behalf of the Government. Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) ­ An individual designated in writing by the Contracting Officer to act as his authorized representative to assist in administering a contract. The source and authority for a COR is the Contracting Officer. COR limitations are contained in the written letter of appointment. 5. RESPONSIBILITIES The Government resources shall have responsibilities for the implementation of this QASP as follows: Contracting Officer ­ The Contracting Officer ensures performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensures compliance with the terms of the contract and safeguards the

The Contracting Officer is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the Contractor's performance. Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) ­ The COR is responsible for administration of the contract and assures proper Government surveillance of the Contractor's performance. The COR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf. Any changes that the Contractor deems may affect contract, price, terms, or conditions shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for action. 6. METHODS OF QA SURVEILLANCE Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) Requirements: (a) The Contractor, in performing this contract, will be subject to past performance assessment in accordance with FAR 42.15 and the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) Guide at: http://www.cpars.navy.mil/cparsfiles/pdfs/navycparsmanual/pdf. All information contained in the assessment may be used by the Government, within the limitations of FAR 42.15, for future source selections in accordance with FAR 15.304 where past performance is an evaluation factor. Assessments will be conducted as prescribed by CPARS guidance. (b) The contractor will be provided with a copy of the assessment. The contractor will have 30 calendar days to submit comments, additional information, or rebut statements if warranted or desired. The contractor must strictly control access to the assessment while in the contractor's possession and must ensure that the assessment is never released to persons or entities outside of the contractor's control. After receipt of Contractor's comments or expiration of the 30 day comment period, whichever occurs first, and depending on the Contractor's response, the Government will: (i) If no comments are received; close the CPARS by the assessing official rep and Reviewing Official. (ii) If Contractor concurs with the assessment; accept/update and close the CPARS and forward comments to all reviewers. (iii) If Contractor does not concur with the assessment, coordinate a final response with Reviewing Official, Assessing Official Representative, and Assessing Official.
