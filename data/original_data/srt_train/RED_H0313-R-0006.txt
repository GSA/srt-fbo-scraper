C-1  OBJECTIVE.   The Semper Fit and Exchanges Services  Division (MR), of Headquarters, United States Marine Corps (HQMC), Quantico, Virginia, requires a Contractor to furnish all materials, personnel, supplies, shipping and travel to perform all work necessary to establish WAN capability using MPLS VPN, in conjunction with ISP (MPLS/ISP), and/or full ISP across the MCCS Enterprise Network within the continental U.S. as described in the Statement of Work in Section C, and elsewhere in this Request for Proposal. 



C-2  GENERAL.  MR, HQMC, Quantico, Virginia, under the staff cognizance of the Deputy Commandant for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, is responsible for providing policy, plans, resources, and support to Marine Corps Community Services (MCCS) activities.  MCCS provides commanders with an integrated organization for the development and delivery of Quality of Life programs and services.  MCCS operates family, fitness and recreation, exchange and business, services and other Quality of Life programs and services for Marines and their families.  The administration, management and operation of local MCCS activities are the responsibility of each installation commander.



C-2.1 MCCS activities are operated on Marine Corps installations on the east and west coasts of the United States; Hawaii, Okinawa, and Japan.  Reference the website:  for further information regarding MCCS activities and locations.



C-2.2  MCCS activities are Non-appropriated Fund Instrumentalities of the Federal government, and are therefore subject to directives issued by the Department of Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps.  The MCCS system generates over one billion dollars in sales per year from a wide variety of business operations.  Earnings from its major revenue generators are used to help fund non-revenue generating MCCS programs.



C-2.3  MCCS is comprised of over 80 programs and is the primary community support provided aboard Marine Corps installations. The Information Technology Branch (MRI) is responsible for developing and providing WAN Solutions for the USMC.



C-3   SCOPE



C-3.1 Phase I -  NETWORK ASSUMPTION:  MRI Information Technology Branch requires the current MPLS/FR service to be transitioned over to the successful offeror. This must be completed by March 15, 2014. 



C-3.2 Phase II - UPGRADE SERVICE:  The contractor shall design, procure, configure and install all equipment necessary to upgrade the service to MPLS VPN, MPLS/ISP or the full ISP solution within the continental U.S. and all internet circuits as well as point to point circuits that traverse from Quantico HQ to Middletown VA and between Parris Island and Beaufort SC (Technical Information is included in Section C-7 and J attachments).  The Quantico, Middletown VA and/or San Diego CA ISP connections will require a /25 block of routable IP space at each location. All other ISP connections for the MPLS VPN/ISP or ISP solution will require a /29 block of routable IP space.  Connectivity to Hawaii and Japan is in place and will not be included in the MPLS cloud and are not within scope of this RFP.  The offeror should submit a proposal for managed and unmanaged premise routers for the MPLS VPN, MPLS/ISP and/or the full ISP solution.  Proposed MPLS solutions must be highly reliable, highly secure, highly available, cost effective, managed-service oriented, and able to support a high quality of service (QoS) for all connections with a minimum proven performance of 99.999%.Proposed ISP solutions must provide a minimum of 99.0% network availability with the exception of San Diego, MCCS HQ (Quantico) and Middletown which must have network availability of 99.99% for their ISP connections



C-4 PROJECT BACKGROUND.

The MCCS Enterprise Network currently operates over a MPLS Frame Relay (MPLS/FR) cloud that supports 32 Marine Corps commands located throughout the U.S. This number fluctuates dependent upon current MCCS mission requirements.  Each site is connected on WAN circuits ranging in size from fractional T1 to T3.  In April, 2014, Frame Relay will no longer be available through our current provider and the MCCS Enterprise network must be assumed by the offeror and/or operational on MPLS VPN, MPLS/ISP or full ISP prior to March 15, 2014.   All MCCS Enterprise Network locations in scope are centrally connected to the MPLS/FR cloud along with two data centers supporting global operations and a satellite cloud that provides backup connectivity for retail credit card subnets only at MCCS sites peered centrally through the Marietta, GA Ground Station’s WAN Link.  The data centers are located in Quantico & Middletown VA, which are interconnected via a point to point DS3 link for specific Server Farm services in addition to serving as a backup to the MPLS FR.  Internet access for all locations currently routes through the Quantico Data Center. The effort to provide redundant Internet access out of Middletown VA and/or San Diego, CA are within the scope of this RFP. 

Also present on the MPLS/FR are Credit card authorizing sites which include ADS and SVS with  AAFES and NEXCOM having MCCS routers on the MPLS cloud. These Credit card authorizations are done directly through the MPLS cloud from each MCCS site.  Other Credit card authorizers are Bank of America, INCOMM, and Heartland, with routers located in the MCCS data centers. The interface and coordination with retail card connection agencies is not a part of this service.

I-1  DEFINITIONS.  As used throughout this contract, the following terms shall have the meaning set out below:



	a.   “MR” identifies the Semper Fit and Exchange Services Division, Headquarters, United States Marine Corps.  "MCCS" identifies United States Marine Corps Community Services activities.



	b.  "Contract" identifies this contract or any modification thereto.



	c.  "Contracting Officer" means a person authorized in writing to execute and administer the contract on behalf of MR and MCCS.  It includes said contracting officer's successor or successors.  (NOTE:  Only the contracting officer may waive or change contract terms; impose additional contract requirements, issue cure, show cause, or termination notices; or render final decisions according to contract terms.)  Other MCCS and government officials who are by virtue of their positions concerned with the administration and operation of this contract may take certain administrative actions in behalf of the contracting officer.  These officials may conduct inspections, process and collect contract payments, make administrative decisions, and perform other duties of an administrative nature.  All questions concerning the authority of other MCCS or government officials should be referred to the Contracting Officer.



	d.  "Contractor" means the individual, partnership, corporation, or other entity which is a party to this contract and who is responsible for all actions, performance and work thereunder, to include that of any subcontractor.  



I-2  LEGAL STATUS. (MAR 09).  Marine Corps Community Services (MCCS) activities are an integral part of the Department of Defense, and are a Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI) of the United States Government.  MCCS contracts are United States contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States except for a judgment or compromise settlement in suits brought under provisions of the Contract Disputes Act (41 USC 601-613), in which event MCCS will reimburse the United States Government (31 USC 1304 [c]).  MCCS procurement is governed by

Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 4105.71 available at

 and Marine Corps

Order P7010.20 available at

.  (NOTE:  The Federal Acquisition Regulation [FAR] published pursuant to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act of 1974, as amended, applies to procurements with appropriated funds.  It does not apply to MCCS procurement except for those provisions of the FAR that have been administratively adopted by MCCS.)



I-3  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS.



	a.  This clause is applicable if the amount of this contract exceeds $10,000 and the contract was entered into by means of negotiation.  The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative shall have the right to examine and audit the books and records of the Contractor directly pertaining to the contract during the period of the contract and until the expiration of three (3) years after final payment under the contract.



	b.  The Contractor agrees to include clause "a" in all subcontracts hereunder which exceed $10,000.



I-4  OFFICIALS NOT TO BENEFIT.  No member of or delegate to Congress, or resident commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of this contract, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom; but this provision shall not be construed to extend to this contract if made with a corporation for its general benefit.



I-5  GRATUITIES.  The MR or MCCS may terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed if, after notice and hearing, the agency head or designee determines that the Contractor, its agent, or another representative—



	a.  Offered or gave a gratuity (i.e., entertainment or gift) to an officer, official, or employee of the MR, MCCS or Marine Corps; and



	b.  Intended, by the gratuity, to obtain a contract or favorable treatment under a contract.



If this contract is terminated per this clause, the MR or MCCS is entitled to pursue the same remedies as in a breach of the contract.  



I-6  ORAL REPRESENTATIONS.  This written contract includes the entire agreement between the parties.  MR and MCCS will not be bound by any oral or written representation not included in the written contract or a change or amendments thereto.  MR and MCCS will not be bound by any terms on Contractor forms or letter unless such terms are specifically agreed to and incorporated in the contract and signed by the Contracting Officer.



I-7  CHANGES.  The Contracting Officer may at any time, by a written order, make changes within the general scope of the contract, in any one or more of the following:  (a) specifications (including drawings and designs); (b) method or manner of performance of the work; (c) MR or MCCS furnished facilities, equipment, materials, services, or site; or (d) accelerating the performance of work.  If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of the work under the contract which was changed, an equitable adjustment may be made in the contract price and the contract may be modified in writing accordingly.  Any claim by Contractor for adjustment under this clause must be asserted no later than 30 days from the date of receipt by the Contractor of the notification of change.  Claims for constructive changes to the contract will not be considered.



I-8  REPRESENTATIONS.  The Contractor shall not represent itself to be an agent or representative of MR, MCCS or any other agency or instrumentality of the United States.



I-9  ADVERTISEMENTS.  The Contractor shall not represent in any manner, expressly or by implication, that items or services purchased or sold under this contract are approved or endorsed by any element of the U.S. Government.  Any advertisement by the Contractor which refers to a military resale or MCCS activity will contain a statement that the advertisement was neither paid for nor sponsored, in whole or in part, by the particular activity.



I-10  SUBCONTRACTING.  Contractor shall not subcontract any part of the work to be performed without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer.  Any subcontractor used in connection with this contract is the agent of the Contractor and not the agent of MR and MCCS.



I-11  ASSIGNMENT.  Contractor shall not assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this contract without the prior written consent of the Contracting Officer.



I-12  REPRESENTATIVES.  Contractor is fully responsible for the actions of all contractor employees, agents, and representatives.  Books and records of contractor representatives are subject to examination and audit under the Examination of Records clause of the contract.



I-13  TAXES.  Contractor assumes complete and sole liability for all federal, state, and local taxes applicable to the property, income, and transactions of the Contractor.  The prices charged MCCS under this contract will be deemed to include all applicable taxes.  The prices charged will not include any amount for taxes which are not applicable:



	a.  by reason of MCCS legal status as an instrumentality of the United States government; or



	b.  by reason of MR and MCCS immunity from direct state or local taxation; or



	c.  by reason of federal, state, or local tax exemptions for sales to the Federal Government; or



otherwise, such as items purchased for export.  



It will be the sole responsibility of Contractor to demonstrate, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Contracting Officer, the applicability and amount of any taxes which are included in the prices charged MR and MCCS.  The Contracting Officer, upon request, will furnish additional documentation to support tax exemptions if required by an appropriate tax authority.



I-14  PERMITS AND LICENSES.  Contractor shall, at his own expense, obtain all necessary permits, give all notices, pay all license fees and comply with all laws, rules, ordinances, and regulations relating to the preservation of the public health or applicable to the service or business carried on under this contract.  The burden of determining applicability of licensing requirements, laws, ordinances, and regulations for Contractor and his employees rests with the Contractor.

 

I-15  NON-WAIVER OF DEFAULTS.  Any failure by MR and MCCS at any time or from time to time to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms and conditions in any way or MR and MCCS's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for breach or breaches of such terms and conditions.



I-16  INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS.



	a.  Contractor shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend MR and MCCS and all other agencies and instrumentalities of the United States, their agents, representatives, employees and customers from any and all suits, judgments and claims, including those established by or pursuant to court decisions, to international agreements, or duly promulgated regulations of the United States Government, and all charges and expenses incident thereto which arise out of or in connection with:



		(1) The alleged or established violation or infringement of any patent, license, copyright or trademark rights asserted by any third party with regard to items or services provided by Contractor;



		(2) Loss, death, damage or injury alleged or established to have arisen out of or in connection with products, services, or equipment provided by Contractor, unless such loss, death, damage, or injury was caused by or resulted solely from the acts or omissions of MR, MCCS, its agents, representatives, or employees.



		(3) Any loss, death, damage, or injury alleged or established to have arisen out of or in connection with any other acts or omissions of the Contractor, the Contractor's subcontractors, representatives, agents, or employees.



	b.  MR and MCCS will give Contractor notice and an opportunity to defend.

 

I-17  INSURANCE.  The Contractor shall maintain, during any contract period, insurance coverage as stated in this contract, with insurance company(ies) acceptable to MR and MCCS.  All liability insurance coverage will name the United States, MR, and MCCS as additional and several insureds for claims, demands, suits, judgments, costs, charges, and expenses arising out of or in connection with any loss, damage, or injury resulting from the negligence or other fault of Contractor, or Contractor's agents, representatives, or employees.  



I-18  WARRANTY.  Contractor warrants that:



	a.  The items furnished shall be merchantable, and fit and sufficient for the use intended and are not "seconds" as the term is normally understood in the trade.  This warranty shall survive acceptance by MR and MCCS of the items and is in addition to other warranties of additional scope given by the Contractor to MR and MCCS.



	b.  The items or services furnished under this contract are covered by the most favorable warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such items or services and that the rights and remedies provided in the Contractor's warranties are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to MR and MCCS by any other clause of this contract.



	c.  Where applicable, the items furnished under this contract have been manufactured in accordance with Underwriter's Laboratories, Inc. (UL) standards, or if manufactured overseas, the overseas equivalent of UL and the applicable item and/or component items carry the appropriate UL or overseas equivalent Seal of Approval.



	d.  Items, packing, and packaging provided will comply with all contract terms and with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to delivery for domestic resale.  Contractor shall comply with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act on all sales to MR and MCCS.

I-20  NON-EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT.  Unless specified elsewhere, this contract does not establish Contractor as the sole supplier of goods or services to be provided on this military installation.



I-21  INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE.  Inspection and acceptance shall be made by the government per Section E of this contract.

If required by MR or MCCS, the Contractor, after notice of defect or non-conformance, shall with all possible speed, correct or replace the defective or non-conforming supplies or services, or any part thereof.  When such rejection, correction or replacement requires transportation of the supplies or part thereof, all shipping and administrative costs to and from the Contractor's plant shall also be borne by the Contractor.



	d.  In the event the Contractor is unable to replace/reperform products/services and the Contractor refunds the purchase price, the Contractor shall be liable to MR and MCCS for the additional costs of reprocurement (if any).



	e.  The provisions of this clause do not affect the rights or obligations of either party, as they may be provided for in other portions of this contract or otherwise under applicable law.



I-22  INVOICING AND PAYMENT.



	a.  Invoicing Instructions.  In order to be considered proper invoices for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act, invoices must be submitted as follows:



		(1) Contractor must prepare a separate numbered invoice for each order or part of an order.  Do not consolidate multiple purchase orders on one invoice.  Additionally, when partial shipments are authorized, use a separate invoice.  Do not duplicate an invoice number used for prior billings.



		(2) Invoices must be issued by the company whose name is on the contract/order (unless otherwise authorized by Contracting Officer) and must contain the following minimum information to enable timely payment:



			(a) Name of Contractor.



			(b) Invoice date.  This cannot be a date earlier than the ship date required by the contract or purchase/delivery order.  In the event that the invoice date is a date earlier than the required ship date, MR and MCCS retains the right either to return the improper invoice to the Contractor for correction or to change the invoice date to be the required ship date.  In the event that an improper invoice is returned to a Contractor because the date on the invoice is earlier than the required ship date or because the invoice is improper for any other reason, the invoice date, for purposes of prompt payment discounts, will be considered to be the date of receipt of the corrected, proper invoice.



			(c) Contract or purchase/delivery order number.



			(d) Item description and quantity shipped/delivered.



			(e) Contract/order line item cost and total.



			(f) Shipping and discount terms, including prompt payment discounts, and special allowance(s) if included in the contract.  Prompt payment discounts and special allowances must be shown on the invoice using percentage figures only.  Do not deduct any of these from the item cost or from the invoice total.  



			(g) "Ship To" address as shown on order or contract.



			(h) Freight charges (on FOB origin shipments).



			(i) Name, title and phone number of Contractor's contact person.



			(j) Complete "remit to" mailing address on the invoice to indicate where Contractor's payment is to be sent.  This address must be the same address as on the contract unless in accordance with paragraph b.(8) below.



		(3) Correcting invoices and credit memos must be marked as such and must cross-reference the corrected invoice.

	b.  Payment



		(1) A proper invoice is an invoice which contains all of the information/documentation specified in paragraph a.(2) above, and is sent to the address specified in the contract or purchase/delivery order for the designated MR or MCCS paying office.  Improper invoices may be returned without payment to the Contractor.



		(2) The net payment date for MR and MCCS contracts is established at 30 days after receipt of a proper invoice.  Discounts for prompt payment, if included in the contract, will be applied as follows:



			(a) If the contract or purchase order specifies a prompt payment discount period of less than 30 days, the discount will be taken if payment can be made within the stated period otherwise the net payment will be due 30 days after receipt of a proper invoice.



			(b) If the contract or purchase order specifies a prompt payment discount period of 30 days or more, the discount will be taken if payment can be made within the stated period otherwise the net payment will be due 30 days after the prompt payment discount period ends.



			(c) If the contract fails to specify any prompt payment discount, then net payment will be due 30 days after receipt of a proper invoice.



		(3) In the event that a prompt payment discount, or other special discounts or allowances specified on Contractor's invoice are better than that specified in the contract or purchase order, MR or MCCS may take the more favorable discounts and/or allowances.



		(4) For the purpose of determining whether payment is timely made by MR or MCCS, a "day" is counted for each calendar day.  When payments fall due on Saturday, Sunday or legal Federal holidays, payments made the following business day will not incur late payment interest penalties.



		(5) A discount for prompt payment can be taken by MR or MCCS if the discounted payment is made within the discount period specified.  The prompt payment discount period begins to run on the date of the invoice.  Computation of the period for prompt payment discounts begins with the date of invoice; computation for net payment begins with receipt of a proper invoice.



		(6) Payment is made:



			(a) the date a check for payment is dated.



			(b) the date an electronic fund transfer is received, regardless of the date the financial institution posts the transfer.



			(c) the date a withholding authorized by the contract is initiated by MR or MCCS.



		(7) Payment will be made by mailing a check to the address shown on the contract, unless the Contractor provided a different "remit to" address to the Contracting Officer at the time the terms were negotiated or the contract was issued.

			(a) If a Contractor wishes to change the address (e.g., street, P.O. box, city/state) to which payment should be sent or wishes its payments to also reflect a factor's name and be sent to the factor's address, the request must be in writing, signed by a responsible official of the Contractor, and submitted to the Contracting Officer.  All such requests must clearly establish which division or subsidiary of a corporation such changes apply to and the address which is superseded by the changes.  These changes will become effective on the date determined by MR or MCCS, normally 30 days after approval.  Changes will be done on an accommodation basis only, with the understanding that no legal obligation is imposed on MR or MCCS for failure to make payment to the new payee/address.



			(b) Any request by the Contractor to change the name shown on the contract or to delegate its obligation under the contract must be sent to the Contracting Officer.



		(8) Any questions or inquiries concerning invoice payments should be directed to the MR or MCCS paying office designated on the contract or purchase/delivery order.



		(9) Any interest penalties due to Contractors will be computed in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act, 31 U.S.C. 3901-3906, as amended.



I-23  WITHHOLDING.  MR or MCCS may withhold payment for:



	a.  Amounts due or creditable to MR or MCCS under this contract, e.g., returns, damages.



	b.  Amounts otherwise due or creditable to MR or MCCS.  Any dispute will be processed under the Disputes clause of this contract unless it became due pursuant to another contract which included a Disputes clause.



I-24  DISPUTES (MCCS). 



a.  This contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601-613).  Except as provided in the Act, all disputes arising under or relating to this contract will be resolved under this clause.



b.  "Claim" as used in this clause means a written demand or written assertion by one of the contracting parties seeking the payment of money in a sum certain or other relief arising under or relating to this contract.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim under this clause.



c.  Contractor must submit any request for monetary or other relief relating to this contract in writing to the Contracting Officer.  The request must specify the amount of money or the other relief requested and include all supporting data.  In addition, with the request or any amendment thereto, Contractor must submit a signed certificate reading as follows:



"I certify that this request and any ensuing claim are made in good faith, that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief, and that any amount requested accurately reflects the amount for which Contractor believes MCCS is liable.



   ________________________________________________________

  (Signature of Individual Authorized to Bind Contractor)"

   

(NOTE:  SUBMISSION OF FALSE CLAIMS IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW AND MAY RESULT IN CIVIL AND OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES.



d.  Contractor's request for payment of money or other relief is not a "claim" until:



              (1) A written request has been received by the Contracting Officer complying fully with  subparagraph “c” above,

              (2) A dispute arises between the parties after a reasonable time for review and disposition, and

              (3) Contractor requests the Contracting Officer to issue a final decision.

       

e.  Contractor's request for a contract modification or for relief that is discretionary with the Contracting Officer will not be considered a "claim."



      	 f.  All disputed claims relating to this contract will be decided by the Contracting Officer, who will issue a written Final Decision and mail or otherwise furnish a copy thereof to Contractor.  The Contracting Officer's decision will be final and conclusive unless:

              (1) Within 90 days from the date of Contractor's receipt of the Contracting Officer's Final Decision, Contractor mails or otherwise furnishes the Contracting Officer a written appeal (two copies) addressed to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA); or

              (2) Within 12 months from the date of Contractor's receipt of the Contracting Officer's Final Decision, Contractor brings an action in the United States Court of Federal Claims.



      	 g.  The decision of the ASBCA is final and conclusive except:

              (1) Contractor may appeal such a decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit within 120 days of receipt of a copy of the decision of the ASBCA.

              (2) MCCS may transmit the decision of the ASBCA to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for judicial review within 120 days from the date of MCCS' receipt of a copy of the decision of the ASBCA.

              (3) ASBCA decisions made under the Board's small claims (expedited) procedures ($50,000 or less) may be set aside only in case of fraud.  In all other cases, the ASBCA decisions on questions of fact may be set aside only where the decisions are fraudulent, arbitrary, capricious, or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad faith, or if such decisions are not supported by substantial evidence.  The decisions of the ASBCA on any questions of law will not be final or conclusive as to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

      

 h.  Pending final resolution on any request for relief, disputed claim, appeal, or action, related to this contract, Contractor will proceed diligently with the performance of this contract and will comply with the Contracting Officer's decisions.

     

  i.  If Contractor cannot support any part of its claim as a result of fraud or misrepresentation of fact, then, in addition to other remedies or penalties provided for by law, Contractor will pay MCCS an amount equal to the unsupported part of the claim plus all MCCS costs attributable to reviewing that part of the claim.

MCCS plans to make a single award, to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to MCCS, price and other factors considered which provides the best value and is in the best interest of MCCS. MCCS may also elect to use any other government contract that is found to be most advantageous to MCCS.



M-2  PROPOSAL EVALUATION  SYSTEM



	a.  Proposal Evaluation.  An evaluation team will be established to evaluate each proposal in response to this solicitation on the basis of the evaluation factors in Section M-3, below.  The technical and non-technical aspects of each proposal will be evaluated.  



Technical evaluation is based upon the elements of each proposal 

package. At MR, we are using a color ranking methodology.   Following are the color rankings and their definitions: 



BLUE:  Exceptional -- Exceeds standards in a beneficial way; high probability of success; no deficiencies.

 

GREEN:  Acceptable -- Meets standards; good probability of success; no deficiencies, but has minor weaknesses that can be readily corrected.



YELLOW:  Marginal -- Fails to meet significant standards; low probability of success; has major weaknesses or minor deficiencies, but there is a potential for correction through discussions.



	RED:  Unacceptable -- Fails to meet significant standards; no reasonable likelihood of success; deficiencies are so major or extensive that a major revision to the proposal is necessary to meet MCCS solicitation requirements.



	c.  Deficient Proposals.  A proposal may be determined to have major deficiencies if it materially deviates from requirements stated in the statement of work.  Such proposals may not be considered for further evaluation or selection.



	d.  Competitive Range Determination 



		(1)  After the technical and price evaluation, the Contracting Officer will determine a competitive range.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to hold Oral Presentations. If  Oral Presentations are scheduled, only those contractors within the competitive range will receive invitation/instructions. All costs for oral presentations, to include labor, supplies, transportation, etc., are borne by the offeror.  



		(2)  Specific instructions for the Oral Presentations will be provided with competitive range determination letters. 



                     (a)  The offeror’s proposed project manager must be present for the oral presentations.  Oral presentations are intended to be technical discussions of the product architecture and function rather than a marketing presentation.  



		(3)  Final Proposal Revisions (FPR) – FPR’s will be requested from the offerors that participate in oral presentations.  Following receipt of the FPR’s, each offer will be further evaluated and an award will be made to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, presents the best value to MCCS.  



	d.  On-Site WAN Review.  MCCS may elect to contact offeror’s reference(s) to arrange a site visit(s) prior to any award decision. 



M-3  EVALUATION FACTORS.  Technical proposals of responsible offerors received shall be evaluated based on the factors set forth below in descending order of importance.  



M-3.1  Evaluation Of Requirements.



	a.  Functional and Technical Fit

	b.  Personnel

	c.  Project/Implementation Plan

	d.  Corporate Experience/Past Performance

	e.  Training and Support



M-3.2   After the quality ratings of proposals have been determined, proposals will be evaluated against price.  Price is an important factor and will be considered in order for the proposal to be included in the competitive range or for an award determination, as follows:



	a.  Lowest price acceptable offer as evaluated combined with consideration to the quality score assigned.

	b.  The superior offer, regardless of cost or price, provided that price is determined to be reasonable and affordable.

	c.  An acceptable offer, the cost of which is not the lowest, but which is sufficiently more advantageous than the lowest offer so as to justify the payment of additional amounts.



M-4  PRICE.  Determination of a realistic price will be used to determine the offeror's understanding of the requirements set forth in the solicitation and to assess the validity of the offeror's approach; i.e., prices which are found to be either unreasonably high or unreasonably low in relation to the work proposed may result in the overall proposal being considered unacceptable and further evaluations may be discontinued.  The burden of proof as to price credibility rests with the offeror.  In determining realistic price, price will be evaluated from the perspective of Pricing Analysis (e.g., competition, historical data, and examination of the current market) to include an examination of individual price elements and the reasonableness of the prices for the effort proposed.  Pricing for Option Years will be considered in the overall price evaluation.



M5.  OPENING OF PROPOSALS AND NEGOTIATIONS:  No information regarding proposals received will be furnished prior to completion of evaluations, negotiation and award of the contract.



M6.  SELECTION:



M-6.1  Notification of Selection.  The Contracting Officer will notify the selected offeror upon completion of the selection process.



M-6.2  Notification of NonSelection.  The Contracting Officer will notify all offerors not selected, advising them of the proposal which was selected and providing non-selected offerors the opportunity to request a debrief.  Debriefs will be conducted by the Contracting Officer upon receipt of a written debrief request from a non-selected offeror and will be limited to the merits of the non-selected offeror’s proposal itself in accordance with the solicitation criteria.
