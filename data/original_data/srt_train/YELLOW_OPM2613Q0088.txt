End of Service Debriefing and Evaluation of Services: The OPM staff will meet with contractors following the delivery of a program or service or when a debriefing can be mutually arranged to discuss the contractor's performance. The review will cover services delivered, the reactions of program participants, faculty and staff and other comments of relevance to satisfactory performance.

F. Termination or Succession of contract: The Contracting Officer upon the recommendations of the COR may not request further services from contractors that do not meet quality performance levels based on degree of negative feedback received from observers of the service, program staff, and/or client agency. G. Contracting Officers Representative (COR) and Evaluation Staff: The evaluation of service is most important to OPM. Input for performance evaluations will be actively sought by the COR and OPM staff that are part of the service area and have contact with the service provider. The customer or client agency will play an important part in the evaluation process. Technical knowledge, delivery of service, strong interpersonal skills and ability to effectively communicate with and get along with customers, faculty, and staff are critical aspects of quality service that are measured by the evaluation staff. 16.

Applicability

This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act). The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act. (b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. (c) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor.

OPM2613Q0088 Page 18 of 56 (d) All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location. All contract employees must be:   Responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents. Responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times and ensuring the use FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption to protect information stored on digital media during transport outside of OPM controlled areas. Responsible for ensuring PII data at rest is encrypted in contractor and government Cloud computing environments. Responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.

 

(e) OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network. Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, it is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure the PII is not inadvertently disclosed to unauthorized individuals. PII must not be sent in the body of an email. Attachments containing PII must be encrypted. (f) IT Security Incident and PII Breach Protection and Notification

All security incidents that involve OPM information or information systems must be reported to the OPM Situation Room. Contractors must also report incidents to the OPM Contracting Officer. This reporting must occur immediately upon discovery of the incident. Incidents and breaches must be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPM's IT security experts will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention. The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail. 1. OPM contractors must report a breach or potential security breach to the OPM Situation Room at: sitroom@opm.gov, (202) 418-0111, Fax (202) 606-0624. 2. When notifying the Situation Room, copy the Contracting Officer. 3.

(b) Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-- (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Â§6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

OPM2613Q0088 Page 44 of 56 (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Â§6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Â§6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. Â§362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 15 days before the contract expires. 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed nine months. 52.237-3 Continuity of Services. (Jan 1991) (a) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, upon contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to-- (1) Furnish phase-in training; and (2) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor. (b) The Contractor shall, upon the Contracting Officer's written notice, (1) furnish phase-in, phase-out services for up to 90 days after this contract expires and (2) negotiate in good faith a plan with a successor to determine the nature and extent of phase-in, phase-out services required. The plan shall specify a training program and a date for transferring responsibilities for each division of work described in the plan, and shall be subject to the Contracting Officer's approval. The Contractor shall provide sufficient experienced personnel during the phase-in, phase-out period to ensure that the services called for by this contract are maintained at the required level of proficiency. (c) The Contractor shall allow as many personnel as practicable to remain on the job to help the successor maintain the continuity and consistency of the services required by this

OPM2613Q0088 Page 56 of 56 contract. The Contractor also shall disclose necessary personnel records and allow the successor to conduct on-site interviews with these employees. If selected employees are agreeable to the change, the Contractor shall release them at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of their earned fringe benefits to the successor. (d) The Contractor shall be reimbursed for all reasonable phase-in, phase-out costs (i.e., costs incurred within the agreed period after contract expiration that result from phase-in, phase-out operations) and a fee (profit) not to exceed a pro rata portion of the fee (profit) under this contract.
