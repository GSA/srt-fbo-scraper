SUBJECT:    Brand Name Justification
      Solicitation /Contract # SP3300-13-Q-0050

REFERENCE:  FAR 13.106-1 & FAR 11.105


   1. DLA J6O, Defense Distribution Center, New Cumberland, PA has a “brand name” requirement for Cisco VTC equipment.

   2. The estimated value of this requirement is $________.

   3. DLA Distribution HQ, a field activity of DLA HQ, has a requirement to modernize and upgrade its VTC capabilities throughout the DLA
      Distribution Enterprise to maximize the use of video face to face communications.  To accomplish this requirement it is necessary to
      procure and install an integrated, interoperable VTC  network throughout the DLA Distribution Enterprise to facilitate communications
      between DLA HQ, DLA Distribution HQ, DLA Distribution field activities, DLA Distribution customers, and the DOD in general.  The DLA
      Distribution intends to procure Cisco VTC Equipment components as recommended by DLA HQ.  Purchasing another brand of VTC equipment would
      result in necessary installation of an entire new VTC system, and excessive higher costs for DLA Distribution.

   4. In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(a)(1)(i), an acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a
      particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full and open competition
      regardless of the number of sources solicited.

   5. As a result of the above, it is hereby determined that it is in the Government’s best interest to conduct this acquisition on a brand name
      basis, limiting sources based on the use of a brand name specification.

   6. The contracting POC is Shane Crusey, 717-770-4425; the DLA J6O POC is ___________, (717) 770-XXXX.

Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.

    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in
      providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also
      an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.
