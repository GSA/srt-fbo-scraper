(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
-

(1) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency; and

(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(3) (  ) Are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [ballot] Have, [ballot] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).  (The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor

5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (APR 2010)

(a)  An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this
acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman
does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not
participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The
ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.

(b)  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to
the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency
level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance
decisions).

(c)  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM or AFISRA ombudsmen, Deputy,
Contracting Division, HQ AETC/A7K, David Jones, 2035 1st  Street West, Ste 1, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4304, phone (210) 652-7907, facsimile (210)
652-8344, david.jones.3@us.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU or ARISRA
level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS)
(Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

(d)  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.

(e)  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such
inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.
