The offeror shall include a description of three (3) examples of offerors' past performance as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor for contracts similar in size, scope, and complexity to the requirements of this solicitation. The past performance examples shall be for contracts or subcontracts performed within the last three years from the date of this solicitation. If an offeror lacks a record of relevant past performance within the last three years, or if an offeror has fewer than three examples of relevant past performance within the last three years, the offeror shall state such clearly in the Volume 1 proposal. The past performance examples shall include a description of the scope of work performed by the offeror for the referenced contract or subcontract, and shall provide a point of contact (including name, agency/firm, telephone number, and email address) for the end user or client for each example. A questionnaire for the offeror's use is found in Attachment 2.

Factor 5 ­ Price The offeror shall complete the Schedule of Supplies and Prices by providing a unit price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). Failure to identify a price for each CLIN or identify the CLIN as Not Separately Priced (NSP) may render the proposal non-responsive and removed from further consideration for award. The contractor shall include all direct and indirect charges and profit into the fixed unit price for each CLIN. For each CLIN the contractor shall supply data to support the price proposed. The contractor shall provide commercial catalog pricing sheets. The contractor shall clearly cross-reference the CLIN price to any supporting data so the Government can ensure that the item offered is commercially available and the price proposed is equal to or less than the commercial price of the item. If adding in direct and indirect charges (eg. management fees, shipping, etc.) results in the CLIN Fixed Unit Price being greater than the commercial catalog price, the contractor shall detail the buildup of the fixed unit price for each CLIN. For example: Catalog Price Discounted Catalog Price Management Fee Shipping & Handling Offered Price $100 $ 95 $ 2 $ 10 $107

An offeror may escalate unit pricing over the five (5) year ordering period of the contract. However, if the offeror chooses to do this it shall not escalate pricing more than once a year. For purposes of escalation the offeror may assume a contract award date of March 14, 2011. If an offeror chooses to escalate pricing it must support each fixed unit price as specified above. An offeror may propose a tiered pricing approach. If an offeror proposes pricing terms other than a standard fixed unit price, the offeror must clearly articulate the terms of its price proposal. For example, What are the quantities of tiers?; Is progression through the tier quantities based upon each individual order or cumulative orders?; Is progession through tiered prices based upon the quantities of an individual order or cumulative orders?; If an order or accumulation of orders places the quantity in another tier must the lower tier be fulfilled at the quantity and price and then the balance in the next tier fulfilled at a different price or is the price of the next tier used for all quantities?. If the Contractor reduces its published commercial price on any item of the contract, the Contractor shall provide the unit price discount of (Contractor to insert percentage) to the Government. A published commercial price list is considered to be a catalog, webpage or any other publication that is readily available to the commercial consumer. In addition, if an item on contract is refreshed with another item, the Contractor shall provide a unit price discount of (Contractor to insert percentage) from the published commercial price list. The percentage shall be at least equal to any percentage initially offered for contract award. ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1(c): The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 90 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers,

Article IX: Evaluation FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Basis of Award--Best Value The Government defines "most advantageous" as the best overall value to the Government. The Government believes that there are certain advantages to be gained from a single award, such as reduced administrative costs, administrative efficiency, and product consistency. However, if as a result of the evaluation the Government is able to obtain best value through split awards by product category as defined in Article V it will do so. The Government will not make multiple awards within a product category. However, if it is determined that the potential advantage to be gained through multiple awards is equal to or less than what can be achieved through making a single award the Government will make a single award resulting from this solicitation. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers for award on either a single award or multiple award basis: Factor 1 ­ Equipment Specifications The Government will evaluate each offeror's proposal to ensure that the proposed configurations meet the specifications provided for each type of equipment and that the same OEM is proposed for a particular category of equipment. The categories of equipment are desktops, laptops, ruggedized laptops, and PC tablets. The Government will validate that the proposed configuration is provided by the offeror in the commercial marketplace. Proposed configurations which exceed the minimum requirements may be evaluated higher depending upon the magnitude and impact of the configuration proposed in comparison to the minimum specification identified by the Government. Failure to meet the minimum specification requirements for any product proposed will be identified as a deficiency and render the Factor to be "Unacceptable". The Government will evaluate the operational availability and suitability of equipment proposed. Equipment that has undergone stringent operational testing of statistically significant samples of production units of the configuration proposed or production units of the model proposed will be determined to lessen the risk to the Government. Equipment that has been favorably tested by an industry recognized third party such as Forrester or Gardner may be evaluated as reducing risk as well. Equipment that has not undergone testing (either of the configuration proposed or the model proposed) shall be evaluated to increase the risk to the Government. The Government will not award a contract to any offer which contains an "Unacceptable" rating within the factor evaluation. Factor 2 ­ Warranty Support The government will evaluate the offeror's approach to provisioning under warranty equipment and service that minimizes the operational downtime of TSA. The Government will evaluate the terms and conditions of the proposed warranty to ensure that it does not place any undue risk (may it be to schedule, performance and/or cost) upon TSA and does not cause TSA to incur costs in other areas. The Government will not award a contract to any offer that contains an "Unacceptable" rating within the factor evaluation.

Page 15

Factor 3 ­ Production The Government will evaluate the offeror's capacity to fulfill large orders (e.g,. Mix of 25,000 units per year and associated peripherals and accessories). The Government will evaluate the offeror's approach to managing the manufacturing process to ensure long lead items do not impact the ability to fulfill contract requirements. The Government will evaluate the offeror's process for installing a Government provided software image prior to shipping any unit. The Government will evaluate the validity of the process and the offeror's experience with the proposed process. The Government will evaluate the robustness of the quality assurance and control program as well as the experience of the offeror with quality control aimed at reducing the number of units requiring reimaging by the Government prior to deploying the unit to the end user. The Government will evaluate the offeror's approach to refreshing the units proposed. The Government will consider the cycle of refresh and how the refresh will impact the Government's return on investment. The Government places a preference on equipment that can reduce the duplication in peripheral costs and supports the mobility of Government employees. For example, a docking station that supports multiple levels of laptops and future refreshes of laptops. The Government will not award a contract to any offer that contains an "Unacceptable" rating within the factor evaluation. Factor 4­ Past Performance The Government will evaluate the offeror's performance on past projects. In addition to evaluating performance, the Government will consider the time period and relevancy of the past performance to the size, scope and complexity of the requirements of this solicitation. Performance on projects that are more recent and/or more relevant to this requirement may be evaluated more favorably. In conducting this evaluation, the TSA may contact the references identified in an offerors' proposal using the questionnaire included as Attachment 2 to this solicitation. Offerors' proposals will be evaluated as either "Favorable", "Unfavorable", or "Neutral" for this evaluation factor. A rating of "Neutral" will be assigned where an offeror lacks a record of relevant past performance. A rating of "Unfavorable" will result in an offer no longer being considered for award. The TSA will evaluate past performance on the basis of all past performance examples included in the offeror's proposal. In addition, the TSA may consider information obtained from other sources in evaluating past performance. Offerors will be afforded an opportunity to respond to any negative past performance information obtained by the TSA in its evaluation. Factor 5 ­ Price The Government will evaluate the offeror's fixed unit prices for unbalanced pricing as described in FAR 15.404-1. In addition, the government will evaluate the proposed prices for fairness and reasonableness. In order to conduct a trade-off analysis the Government will determine a Total Evaluated Price (TEP). The TEP will be determined by multiplying the fixed unit price of an item over an estimated number quantities to be purchased over the five year ordering period. If
Page 16

an offeror proposes escalated pricing, tiered pricing or a combination thereof, the Government shall determine the TEP based upon the pricing terms identified in the offeror's proposal. The Government will not release the quantities used to determine the TEP. The quantities will have been identified prior to the issuance of this solicitation, sealed and maintained by the Contracting Officer until such time as price proposals are received and turned over to the evaluation team. For planning purposes the Government anticipates purchases of significant quantities in years 1 and 4 of the ordering period. Relative Order of Importance Factor 1 ­ Equipment is the most important factor. Factor 1 ­ Equipment is more important than Factor 2 ­ Warranty Support. Factor 2 - Warranty Support is more important than Factor 3 ­ Production. Factor 3 ­ Production is more important than Factor 4 ­ Past Performance. When combined Factors 1 ­ 4 are more important than Factor 5 ­ Price. When the merits of competing proposals approach equal, Factor 5 ­ Price will become more important in any trade-off decisions. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards based upon the product categories as defined in Article V. If the Government chooses to make an award determination based upon individual product categories, a TEP for each category will be determined using the process identified above. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Notification To Offerors of Contractor Support of the Selection Process (1) Offerors are advised that employees of the firms identified below may serve as Source Selection Organization advisers in the source selection process.

This information includes press releases, promotional literature, price lists, and deliverables. Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) Certification of OCI By submitting an offer or proposal, the Offeror or Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest (OCI), or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information. Post-Award OCI Disclosure The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential OCI is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer. This disclosure shall include a mitigation plan describing actions the Contractor has taken or proposes to take to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the actual or potential conflict. Changes in the Contractor's relationships due to mergers, consolidations or any unanticipated circumstances may create an unacceptable organizational conflict of interest which may necessitate such disclosure. The TSA reserves the right to review and audit OCI mitigation plans as needed after award, and to reject mitigation plans if the OCI, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer cannot be avoided, or mitigated. Contract Termination for OCI The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

The Contractor also agrees that Government-provided information marked "For Official Use Only," "Confidential," or "Proprietary" must also be similarly protected and shall take all reasonable measures necessary to prohibit access to such information by any such person other than those Contractor employees needing such information to perform the work, i.e., on a need-toknow basis. (a) The Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer in the event it determines or has reason to suspect a breach of this requirement. (b) The Contractor shall require that all employees and consultants who are given access to such information sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure statement agreeing to safeguard the confidentiality of all such information gathered or provided to them hereunder as an integral condition of their employment. (c) Upon the Government's request, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer with plans and procedures to ensure the confidentiality and physical security of information gathered or provided hereunder. (d) The Contractor may "gather and analyze" information that is not furnished or owned by the Government. Such information will not be subject to the restrictions in this clause. Confidentiality of Data and Information (a) In the performance of this order, the Contractor, its consultants and or subcontractors, may need access to information in the Government's possession which is encumbered with restrictions on the Government's rights to use or disclose, or that might preclude dissemination or use other than in the performance of this contract. By reason of the foregoing, the Contractor agrees that any employee, subcontractor or consultant it uses shall comply with all restrictive legends or markings on data, software, or information it uses, and further agrees not to: (1) Knowingly disclose such data or information to others without prior written authorization from the Contracting Officer, unless that data or information has otherwise become available to the public through no action or fault of the Contractor; and (2) Use for any purpose other than the performance of this Contract data bearing a restrictive marking or legend, unless such information or data has otherwise fallen into public domain through no action or fault of the Contractor.

(4) "Information Technology Resources" include, but are not limited to, computer equipment, networking equipment, telecommunications equipment, cabling, network drives, computer drives, network software, computer software, software programs, intranet sites, and internet sites. Disclosure of Information ­Official Use Only Any TSA Information made available or to which access is provided, and which is marked or should be marked "Official Use Only", shall be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and shall not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract. Disclosure to anyone other than an officer or employee of the contractor or subcontractor at any tier shall require prior written
Page 39

approval of the TSA. Requests to make such disclosure should be addressed to the TSA contracting officer. Notification of Proper Use and Penalties for Misusing "Official Use Only" Information Each officer or employee of the contractor or subcontractor at any tier to whom "Official Use Only" information may be made available or disclosed shall be notified in writing by the contractor that "Official Use Only" information disclosed to such officer or employee can be used only for the purpose and to the extent authorized herein, and that further disclosure of any such "Official Use Only" information, by any means, for a purpose or to an extent unauthorized herein, may subject the offender to criminal sanctions imposed by 18 U.S.C. Sections 641 and 3571. Section 641 of 18 U.S.C. provides, in pertinent part, that whoever knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or without authority sells, conveys, or disposes of any record of the United States or whoever receives the same with the intent to convert it to his use or gain, knowing it to have been converted, shall be guilty of a crime punishable by a fine or imprisoned up to 10 years or both. Use of Foreign Nationals and Foreign Entities on TSA Contracts All contractor employees, whether employed by the contractor, a subcontractor or who is consultant to TSA, involved in the performance of this contract and requiring access to areas controlled by TSA, an FDS or IFSR or access to sensitive information and/or resources shall be a citizen of the United States or an immigrant alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence as evidenced by Alien registration Receipt Card Form I-151. Copies of appropriate, valid INS documentation must be made available to the Government upon request. Facility and Sensitive Information Access for Immigrant Aliens For immigrant aliens who are working under this contract and require access to facilities, sensitive information a/or resources the following conditions must be met:  The foreign national must have resided within the United States for 3 years of the last 5 years unless a waiver of this requirement is requested and approved from TSA;  TSA makes a valid risk or sensitivity level designation for the position; and  TSA shall conduct the appropriate security screening for the position. Disclosure of Technology to Non-Immigrant Alien Disclosure of source code, technology, or documentation to a nonimmigrant alien, a type of foreign national not authorized access may be considered to be an export and export control violation by TSA. The contractor shall at all time comply with Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. parts 120 through 130, and the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 C.F.R. parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In complying with these export provisions, the contractor shall determine the applicability of license exemptions; exceptions and obtain appropriate licenses or other approvals for exports of source code, technology, and
Page 40

documentation. The contractor shall make the same determinations where its use of nonimmigrant aliens would allow them access to export sensitive information. Acquisitions involving foreign nationals or foreign entities are subject to the following provisions: Use of Non-Immigrant Aliens and Non-US Companies The contractor shall submit an explanation to the TSA contracting officer of why use of the nonimmigrant alien would not violate export restrictions. The contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the license and license exemption or exception. Copies of export related determinations and documentation shall be provided to TSA upon request. For export or security reasons, TSA reserves the right to exclude Offerors with a controlling degree of non U.S. ownership, and non U.S. place of business or nonimmigrant aliens from being given access to software, equipment, technology or documentation necessary to prepare an offer or to perform the contract. Offerors should be aware that obtaining an export clearance license may still be outweighed by security concerns. Any potential Offeror either having or intending to make significant use of, non US companies or personnel that are nonimmigrant aliens is encourage to consult the TSA contracting officer prior to committing resources. This clause shall flow down to subcontractors. Protection of Sensitive Technologies Information and Release Of Information All technical data provided to the Contractor by the Government shall be protected from public disclosure in accordance with the markings contained thereon.

NOTE: Breach of Security for the purposes of this definition should not be confused with breach of security in screening operations. (c) In the event of a major breach of safety or security, the Contractor shall report the breach to the Contracting Officer. If directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall conduct its own investigation and report the results to the Government. The Contractor shall cooperate with the Government investigation, if conducted.

Suitability Screening Requirement All contract employees assigned to work with the TSA under this contract that require stafflike access to TSA facilities on a recurring basis (more than three times per year) shall be required to undergo a suitability determination process which must be completed prior to working under this contract. A suitability determination is required regardless of whether or not a contractor has been previously investigated, has held a security clearance, or currently holds a security clearance. Contract employees must be US Citizens. Permanent Residents are not authorized to work on this contract. In accordance with DHS MD 11055, "Suitability Screening Requirements for Contractors," paragraph 4.E.1, Only US Citizens can access TSA's Information Technology (IT) Systems or documents containing Sensitive Security Information (SSI). Contract employees must be eligible or have been the subject of a favorably adjudicated NACI within the last ten (10) years. Suitability Determination for Contractor Employees
1. The contractor`s performance under this contract may require access to DHS/TSA facilities, information, and systems. Contractor employees under this contract are subject to a suitability determination to assess whether their employment or continued employment under this contract protects or promotes the efficiency of the services provided. TSA, by and through the Office of Personnel Security (PerSec) will continue the employment only for those individuals who are adjudicated suitable for employment as a TSA contractor. Individuals who are adjudicated unsuitable for employment as a TSA contractor will be removed from the contract at the direction of the COTR. The suitability adjudication shall be accomplished in accordance with the procedures contained in this clause. 2. The contractor shall provide, for each employee who will be employed under this contract, the following information:

     

Full Name Social Security Number Date of Birth Place of Birth E-mail Address Telephone Number

The information shall be provided to the COTR in electronic format, in a passwordprotected document. The contractor shall provide the COTR separately with the password for the document. 3. Upon receipt of the information, the COTR will contact each contractor employee to provide instructions and guidance for the completion of the electronic, on-line version of the Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position. PerSec will also provide the contractor employee with the form TSA 2201, Fair Credit Reporting Act, as well as
Page 43

the requirement to obtain fingerprints. Contractor employees shall complete the form and shall obtain fingerprints in accordance with the instructions from PerSec. 4. Upon receipt of all correctly completed documents, the PerSec will conduct a Preliminary Background Check and will adjudicate the contractor employee`s information to determine initial suitability for beginning performance of work under the contract. 5. The initial suitability determination will be made on the basis of a review of the contractor employee`s consumer credit report, a criminal records history check, and a local agency records check to determine to the extent possible if the Contractor employee has uncollected debt, criminal offenses, falsification of information, or any other issues that would prohibit performance under a DHS/TSA contract. 6. An initial favorable adjudication enables the contract employee to begin work under the contract. However, a favorable adjudication based on the Preliminary Background Check is not the final favorable suitable adjudication. 7. PerSec will provide notification to the COTR of the contractor employee`s adjudication status. The COTR will in turn notify the contractor. 8. Following the initial adjudication, the TSA PerSec will coordinate with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to schedule a full background investigation of the contractor employee. The background investigation will normally be completed by OPM within 120 days of being contacted by the TSA. 9. Following the completion of the full background investigation, PerSec will make a final suitability adjudication of the contractor employee for the purpose of determining whether the contractor employee will be allowed to continue working under the contract. a) The final suitability determination will be made on the basis of the completed background investigation, all documents submitted to TSA during the process described in this clause, and any other relevant information obtained by the PerSec. b) PerSec will notify the COTR of the final adjudication. The COTR will in turn notify the contractor. 10. Any contractor employee determined to be unsuitable at any point in the process described in this clause shall be immediately removed from performance on any part of this contract by the contractor and shall not have access to any DHS/TSA facilities, or information 11. In accordance with the PWS, all data provided to the contractor or collected by the contractor for the purpose of work performance shall not be used outside of the contract. At the end of the contract, the contractor and all subcontractors shall return said data and destroy additional copies of said data files, etc. compiled during the course of executing this contract.

(c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.21621 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order limitations in paragraph (b) of this section. (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within 5 days after issuance, with written notice stating the Contractor's intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons.

FAR 9.505-4 -- Obtaining Access to Proprietary Information. (a) When a contractor requires proprietary information from others to perform a Government contract and can use the leverage of the contract to obtain it, the contractor may gain an unfair competitive advantage unless restrictions are imposed. These restrictions protect the information and encourage companies to provide it when necessary for contract performance. They are not intended to protect information-- (1) Furnished voluntarily without limitations on its use; or (2) Available to the Government or contractor from other sources without restriction. (b) A contractor that gains access to proprietary information of other companies in performing advisory and assistance services for the Government must agree with the other companies to protect their information from unauthorized use or disclosure for as long as it remains proprietary and refrain from using the information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished. The contracting officer shall obtain copies of these agreements and ensure that they are properly executed. (c) Contractors also obtain proprietary and source selection information by acquiring the services of marketing consultants which, if used in connection with an acquisition, may give the contractor an unfair competitive advantage. Contractors should make inquiries of marketing consultants to ensure that the marketing consultant has provided no unfair competitive advantage.
