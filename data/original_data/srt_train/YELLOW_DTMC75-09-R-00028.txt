PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR SERVICES TO DEVELOP, SUPPORT, MAINTAIN, UPGRADE AND ENHANCE AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE SYSTEM February, 2009 1. BACKGROUND In support of the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) strategic highway safety objective, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's (FMCSA's) primary goal is to ensure the safe operation of interstate motor carriers ­ specifically, to reduce fatalities and injuries associated with commercial motor vehicle (CMV) crashes. The FMCSA enforces a wide range of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) and Hazardous Material Regulations (HMRs), intended to minimize and reduce the risk of CMV crashes. The FMCSA administers a compliance and enforcement program to support the Department's goal of reducing fatalities and injuries associated with CMV crashes. FMCSA uses enforcement staff comprised of Federal and State safety investigators to implement its enforcement program. Safety Investigators must have access to the most current Federal rules and regulations and enforcement policies, interpretation and guidance when conducting on-site compliance reviews, investigations and roadside inspections. The FMCSA currently uses its Motor Carrier Regulations Information System (MCREGIS) to provide up to date motor carrier regulatory information and guidance to its enforcement staff. The safety information and regulations can be accessed and queried by the safety enforcement staff. MCREGIS is used by FMCSA's safety investigators and State partner-agencies nationwide. MCREGIS runs on the Windows 2000/XP/Vista operating system. MCREGIS source content is XML. MCREGIS is a text-based system. The information in the database is organized into the following indices and sub-topic categories: Motor Carrier ˇ Regulations o Federal and State transportation rules and regulations o Codified transportation regulations o Regulatory interpretations ˇ Documents o Federal and State transportation legislative and regulatory information o Proposed and final rulemakings o FMCSA enforcement policies and guidance o Commercial motor vehicle inspection documents ˇ Education & Technical Assistance ˇ Contacts

It is a key shortcut feature for moving within the MCREGIS IV software) State Information (This sub-topic area is used to store those topics that are specific to State regulatory Agencies. It to is a shortcut function that directs a user to a specific subject matter area and helps to organize State related information for ease of use by the user.) Recent Changes (This topical area identifies and provides the user with a way of quickly identifying those topics, regulations, and/or documents that have been updated in each respective update issue.) Quick Start Guide (Out-of-Service Criteria (This topical area is designed to house the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Alliance's Out-Of-Service guide.

(This topical area is designed to house the hazardous material Emergency Response Guide. This publication is used by first responders when dealing with hazardous material related incidents, spills and crashes.) The Agency is currently looking to expand the role of its information system by centralizing all enforcement related information and making this information more accessible to enforcement staff. This requirement is for development, support, maintenance, upgrades and enhancements of electronic database software developed for FMCSA. The system will enable users to access information by following hyperlinks or using a search engine for quick retrieval. The software system shall store and provide easy retrieval of information and documents related to Federal and State commercial motor vehicle safety and transportation. This project will replace FMCSA's existing information database software, MCREGIS. 2.
