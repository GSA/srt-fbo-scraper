The MSEL CTCMS has a new requirement for a number of highly parallel, high memory-capacity computer systems, along with amount of supporting
equipment.  This requirement consists of six computer systems, three battery-backed uninterruptible power supplies, and spare components.


Computer systems:
-----------------

Five highly parallel large-memory computer server systems.

    Each of the five systems consists of:

       - 8x quad-core CPUs, clocked at 2.6 GHz or faster, with 64-bit amd64/em64t
         architecture (not ia64 architecture)
       - 128 GB of DDR2-800 Reg ECC RAM (or faster)
       - Motherboard capable of supporting the above
       - VGA-capable video output (may be built-in to motherboard)
       - Dual Gigabit ethernet ports (may be built-in to motherboard)
       - Serial port (may be built in to motherboard)
       - Dual USB 2.0 ports (may be built in to motherboard)
       - externally accessible eSATA port (may be built in to motherboard)
       - 2x 500GB SATA hard drives, 7200 RPM or faster
       - 19-inch wide rack-mount chassis sufficient for the above, with rail
         mounting kit.  Smallest available rack height.
       - Dual-redundant power supplies sufficient to power the above.
       - Optical drive capable of reading DVDs.

     A sixth system is also required, with fewer CPUs and less memory:

       - 2x quad-core CPUs, 2.6 GHz or faster
       - 32GB of DDR2-800 Reg ECC RAM
       - No redundancy requirement for the power supply
       - All other specifications as above

All provided components must operate correctly with device drivers provided in version 2.6.26 or later of the Linux kernel.

No installed operating system is required, but if provided, it must be Debian Linux 5.0 ("lenny") for the amd64/em64t architecture.


Battery backed Uninterruptible Power Supplies:
----------------------------------------------
3x 3000 VA-capacity 19-inch 120V rack-mount UPSs with NEMA L5-30P inputs and 120V NEMA 5-15R or 5-20R outputs.


Spares:
-------
As part of this order, we also require two spare memory modules for the provided large-memory computer systems, and one set of spare batteries
for the provided battery back-up power supply.
