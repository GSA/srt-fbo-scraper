                                      Server Middleware and Test Infrastructure (SMTI) Division, Middleware

Section C- DESCRIPITION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT
C.1. BACKGROUND. The Middleware Support Services Section (MSSS or Middleware) falls under the Middleware Branch of the Server Middleware and
Test Infrastructure (SMTI) Division of Enterprise Operations (EOPS), a key organization within Modernization and Information Technology Services
(MITS).   MSSS was created as the result of the re-organization of Enterprise Operations by the implementation of the Competency Based
Organization (CBO).

The mission of Middleware is to deploy and support the production middleware components, problem analysis, and infrastructure application
integration support and enhancements. This support is provided by a dedicated staff located at the New Carrollton Federal Building (NCFB),
Lanham, MD with remote access to all components.


Middleware is responsible for the transition of middleware products from Modernization to the IRS, and for supporting the entire lifecycle of
the modernized infrastructure that has been/will be transitioned to EOPS.  This includes the integration, configuration, and customization of
Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software (e.g., WebSphere, SiteMinder, Business Objects, Informatica, and MQ Series), as well as custom
developed infrastructure applications and interfaces (e.g., Application Messaging and Data Access Service (AMDAS), Enterprise Directory and
Authentication Services (EDAS), Content Delivery Services (CDS), Single Sign On (SSO), and Enterprise Application Integration Broker (EAIB).
These COTS and custom infrastructure applications support both the Registered User Portal (RUP) and the Employee User Portal (EUP) and
associated security and subsystems.


In addition the Middleware Infrastructure Integration Section (MIIS) is responsible for developing new/enhanced products defined by future
business requirements.  System availability and reliability are of the utmost importance to the Government.


C.1.1. Middleware Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Stakeholders. The Middleware Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Stakeholders are the Business and
Enterprise Operations organizations components, employees and contractors that have a direct or indirect stake the infrastructure supporting the
Enterprise Production Environment. The SMTI Middleware Technical Support project is managed by MSSS.   Middleware is responsible for the overall
project and serves as the program and systems integrator and will be the only organization that assigns work under this contract.  Middleware
O&M is a collaborative effort among the project stakeholders.  The following table lists roles of each primary project stakeholder for
Middleware O&M.

Middleware O&M and technical support spans several geographically separate locations including: IBM Web-Hosting centers located at Sterling, VA,
and Chicago, IL; the IRS NCFB, and the Enterprise Computing Centers at Martinsburg, WV ECC-MTB, Memphis, TN ECC-MEM and Detroit, MI ECC-DET.
The production environment serves internal users, external taxpayers, Third Party Tax Preparers, and States on a twenty-four hour yearly basis
for seven days a week (24 x 7 x 365 days per year basis).  The duty station for all contractor personnel shall be at NCFB.


C.1.2. Middleware O&M System Overview. Enterprise Operations is a large, highly distributed organization with responsibilities that span all
parts of the IRS.  EOPS provides enterprise level 24x7x365 support for business applications and other IRS systems. The environment is complex
with all tiers of Information Technology (IT) represented including Unisys/IBM mainframes, and Solaris/Windows/Linux servers of all sizes.
Software includes Oracle and DB2 database management systems, COTS (e.g., including MQ Series, Business Objects, Infomatica, WebSphere,
EAIB/webMethods); and custom code.


The Middleware Section supports a variety of COTS and custom infrastructure application components within the enterprise.  These components are
shared among business applications, e-services, Modernized Electronic Filing (MeF), Integrated Financial System (IFS), Internet Refund Fact of
Filing (IRFOF), Internet Employer Identification Number (IEIN), CADE2, etc.  Middleware provides technical and O&M support from front-end
portals to the back-end systems including infrastructure interfaces between systems, e.g., CDS, Security Audit and Analysis System (SAAS), and
Error Store.


External taxpayers and users access the IRS systems using the RUP through both Sterling, VA and Chicago, IL.  There are two types of users, self-
authenticating (SA) and login-authenticating (LA).  Each RUP contains both SA & LA portals.  SA portals support Web-based applications only,
while the LA portals support Web-based and Web-services (Application to Application) operations.


Internal IRS employees use the EUP to access business applications to perform their duties.  The EUP is located at ECC-MTB and interfaces with a
variety of backend systems for IRS only (e.g., Business Objects).


Middleware consists of, but not limited to, the following transitioned components that may require support:

(including for in-process activities), provide a list of risks and mitigation strategies for the transition, and contain a detailed, resource
balanced project schedule developed with Microsoft Project. The project schedule shall identify the work to be performed, dependencies,
deliverables and milestones, and include milestones for dependencies to other project stakeholders.


The Government shall have 5 days to review the draft Transition Plan and provide comments to the Contractor. Government and Contractor
representatives will then meet to discuss the comments after which the Contractor shall have 5 days to incorporate the agreed-upon changes and
deliver a final transition plan.

At contract award, the Contractor shall also deliver the project team staff roster and contact information.  The IRS COTR will provide to the
contractor in electronic format the SFA program and other required security investigation forms.  At no time prior to the contractor’s staff
receiving their “Interim Staff Like Access” memo, are they permitted to work on and access project information.

The Contractor shall report the current status to the Middleware PO on a weekly basis as a written report by COB Tuesdays.  The status
presentation will correctly reflect the current status of the project and shall describe all activities that will be performed to accomplish the
work described therein.  On a weekly basis, the Middleware PO will request status updates from stakeholders. The updates will be based on the
overall master Middleware project schedule in which the Contractor’s activities are included. The Middleware PO will distribute a template
listing the tasks for which status is required and the Contractor shall complete the status, including specifically actual start date, percent
complete, and actual finish date if applicable. The Contractor shall use the template and provide explanations for any tasks that are behind

otherwise deemed appropriate by the COTR.  The Government reserves the right to determine the fitness or suitability of a contractor employee to
receive or be assigned staff-like access under a contract, and whether the employee shall be permitted to perform or continue performance under
the contract.  Security screenings of contractor employees which reveal the following may be grounds for declining staff-like access under a
contract: conviction of a felony, a crime of violence or a serious misdemeanor, a record of arrests for continuing offenses, or failure to file
or pay Federal income tax.  (Note:  This is not an inclusive list.)  Upon notification from Personnel Security of an acceptable (favorably
adjudicated) contractor employee security screening, the COTR will complete an Online 5081 (OL5081), Automated Information System (AIS) User
Registration/Change Request, for each prime or subcontractor employee and require an electronic signature from each employee indicating the
contractor employee has read and fully understands the security requirements governing access to the Service’s IT systems.  IRS approval of the
OL5081 is required before a contractor employee is granted access to, use or operation of IRS IT systems.  IRM 10.8.1 includes more detailed
information on the OL 5081.
3.    Contractor Acknowledgement.
The contractor also acknowledges and agrees that he or she understands that all contract employees must comply with all laws, IRS system
security rules, IRS security policies, standards, and procedures. The contractor also acknowledges that a contract employee’s unsanctioned,
negligent, or willful violation of the laws, IRS system security rules, IRS security policies, standards, and procedures may result in the
revocation of access to IRS information technology systems, immediate removal from IRS premises and the contract, and for violations of Federal
statute or state laws, the contract employee may be subject to arrest by Federal law enforcement agents.
4.    Limited Personal Use of Government IT Resources.
   a. Contractors, like employees, have no inherent right to use Government IT resources, and this policy does not create the right to use
      Government IT resources for nongovernmental purposes.  However, as a courtesy, the privileges (and restrictions) established by IRM
      10.8.27, IRS Policy On Limited Personal Use of Government Information Technology Resources for employees, are extended to contractors.
   b. Contractors, like employees, have the privilege to use Government IT resources for nongovernmental purposes when such use:
    • involves minimal additional expense to the Government;
    • occurs during non-work hours for reasonable duration and frequency;
    • does not violate the Codes of Ethical Conduct;
    • does not overburden any of the IRS’ IT resources;
    • does not adversely affect the performance of official duties;
    • does not interfere with the mission or operations of the IRS; and
    • complies with existing Federal Government, Department of the Treasury, and IRS policies for, but not limited to— ethics, security,
      disclosure, and privacy.
   c. Contractors, like employees, are specifically prohibited from inappropriate Internet usage such as participation in: gambling, pornography,
      personal communication on social networking sites, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, downloading unauthorized programs or software, and
      other activities that open IRS information or information systems to security risks. Specific examples are referenced in IRM 10.8.27,
      Exhibit 10.8.27-1, Prohibited Uses of Government IT Resources.
   d. Contractors, like employees,  are specifically prohibited from the pursuit of private commercial business activities or profit-making
      ventures using the Government’s IT resources. The ban also includes the use of the Government’s IT resources to assist relatives, friends,
      or other persons in such activities.
   e. Contractors, like employees, are specifically prohibited from engaging in any political fundraising activity, endorsing any product or
      service, participating in any lobbying activity, or engaging in any prohibited partisan political activity, in accordance with, Title 5 -
      Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) - Part 735, Office of Personnel Management, Employee Responsibilities and Conduct.
   f. Contractors, like employees, should have no expectation of privacy, while using any Government IT resources at any time, including (but not
      limited to) accessing the Internet or using e-mail.
Any unauthorized use may be reported to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), the Contracting Officer, and the Computer
Security Incident Response Center (CSIRC) (for subsequent referral to the Department of Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration
(TIGTA) and/or the Personnel Security, Centralized Adjudication Group (CAG), as appropriate).
5.    Replacement Personnel.
The contractor acknowledges that in the event of an alleged violation of the policies and rules on access, use or operation of IRS’ IT
resources, the IRS, at its discretion, may immediately withdraw access privileges of the contractor employee alleged to have violated said
policies and rules, and request suspension of that employee from performance under this or any IRS contract pending the conclusion of its
investigation of the matter.  At the conclusion of the its investigation, if the IRS determines that extended or permanent revocation of access
to IRS’ IT resources computer systems and/or facilities, or other disciplinary action is warranted or in its best interest, the contractor
agrees to remove the contractor employee that was the subject of the investigation within one day of official notification by the IRS of its
access eligibility determination, and provide a replacement within five days.  Replacement personnel must be acceptable to the IRS.  The
proposed replacement personnel must have a substantive amount of experience in the job position in which they will be performing; including
equal or greater qualifications as the individual being replaced.  In evaluating proposed replacement personnel, the IRS reserves the right to
make an assessment on the technical and/or professional qualifications of the proposed substituting individual(s).  The Contracting Officer (on
the advice and recommendation of the COTR) has the right to disallow the proposed substituting individual(s) from performing under the subject
contract, when the technical and/or professional qualifications of the proposed replacement personnel are determined (1) not to be substantially
equivalent to the technical and/or professional qualifications of the personnel they are to replace, or (2) not sufficient to reasonably insure
successful performance, or (3) otherwise endanger contract performance, progression, or completion.  New hires or replacement personnel are
subject to and must receive an acceptable (favorably adjudicated) contractor employee security screening conducted by Personnel Security.
6.    Monitoring Notification.
IRS management retains the right to monitor both the content and the level of access of contractor employees’ use of IRS IT systems.  Contractor
employees do not have a right, nor should they have an expectation, of privacy while using any IRS information technology system at any time,
including accessing the Internet or using e-mail.  Data maintained on government office equipment may be subject to discovery and Freedom of
Information Act requests.  By using government information technology systems, consent to monitoring and recording is implied with or without
cause, including (but not limited to) accessing the Internet or using e-mail or the telephone.  Any use of government information technology
systems is made with the understanding that such use is generally not secure, is not private and is not anonymous.
7.    Subcontracts.
The Contractor shall incorporate this clause in all subcontracts, subcontract task or delivery orders or other subcontract performance
instrument where the subcontractor employees will require access, use or operation of IRS information technology systems. [End of clause]

|"Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the     |
|conduct of business with the Government.                                                                                                 |

|"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned|

|(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the   |

|(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting |
|from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration,|
|the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its       |
|information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms |
|and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.                                    |
|(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the   |

|novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of   |
|one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of |
|Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The  |
|Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.                              |
|(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at |
|paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR          |
|information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect       |
|information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.  |
|(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect|
|an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately          |
|registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT,|
|to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor shall be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension|
|of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.                                                                                |

|Any inconsistency in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order:                        |

|(b) Representations and other instructions.                                                                                              |

|(e) The specifications. (End of clause)                                                                                                  |


I.4 52.215-21 REQUIREMENTS FOR COST OR PRICING DATA OR INFORMATION OTHER THAN COST OR PRICING DATA –MODIFICATIONS (OCT 1997)
 (a) Exceptions from cost or pricing data.
(1) In lieu of submitting cost or pricing data for modifications under this contract, for price adjustments expected to exceed the threshold set
forth at FAR 15.403-4 on the date of the agreement on price or the date of the award, whichever is later, the Contractor may submit a written
request for exception by submitting the information described in the following paragraphs. The Contracting Officer may require additional
supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to determine whether an exception should be granted, and whether the price is fair and
reasonable—
(i) Identification of the law or regulation establishing the price offered. If the price is controlled under law by periodic rulings, reviews,
or similar actions of a governmental body, attach a copy of the controlling document, unless it was previously submitted to the contracting
office.
(ii) Information on modifications of contracts or subcontracts for commercial items.
(A) If—
(1) The original contract or subcontract was granted an exception from cost or pricing data requirements because the price agreed upon was based
on adequate price competition or prices set by law or regulation, or was a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of a commercial item; and

(2) The modification (to the contract or subcontract) is not exempted based on one of these exceptions, then the Contractor may provide
information to establish that the modification would not change the contract or subcontract from a contract or subcontract for the acquisition
of a commercial item to a contract or subcontract for the acquisition of an item other than a commercial item.
(B) For a commercial item exception, the Contractor shall provide, at a minimum, information on prices at which the same item or similar items
have previously been sold that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price of the modification. Such information may include—
(1) For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items, or a statement
that the catalog is on file in the buying office to which the proposal is being submitted. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies
and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each
offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in
quantities similar to the proposed quantities.
(2) For market-priced items, the source and date or period of the market quotation or other basis for market price, the base amount, and
applicable discounts. In addition, describe the nature of the market.
(3) For items included on an active Federal Supply Service Multiple Award Schedule contract, proof that an exception has been granted for the
schedule item.
(2) The Contractor grants the Contracting Officer or an authorized representative the right to examine, at any time before award, books,
records, documents, or other directly pertinent records to verify any request for an exception under this clause, and the reasonableness of
price. For items priced using catalog or market prices, or law or regulation, access does not extend to cost or profit information or other data
relevant solely to the Contractor’s determination of the prices to be offered in the catalog or marketplace.
(b) Requirements for cost or pricing data. If the Contractor is not granted an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data,
the following applies:
(1) The Contractor shall submit cost or pricing data and supporting attachments in accordance with Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408.
(2) As soon as practicable after agreement on price, but before award (except for unpriced actions), the Contractor shall submit a Certificate
of Current Cost or Pricing Data, as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2.
(End of clause)

 I.6 52.216-22 INDEFINITE QUANTITY (OCT 1995)
|(a) This is an indefinite-quantity contract for the supplies or services specified, and effective for the period stated, in the Schedule.|
|The quantities of supplies and services specified in the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract.             |
|(b) Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause.  The Contractor    |
|shall furnish to the Government, when and if ordered, the supplies or services specified in the Schedule up to and including the quantity|

|(d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the         |
|Contractor within the time specified in the order.  The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations   |
|with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the  |
|Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after the end of the period or performance (April 30, 2017). |
|(End of clause)                                                                                                                          |

|As prescribed in 9.104-7(a), insert the following clause:                                                                                |
|(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that                                                              |
|(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals                                                                                             |
|(A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any      |
|Federal agency;                                                                                                                          |
|(B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them  |
|for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal,      |
|State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or      |
|commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion,      |
|violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks have, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if       |
|included in this solicitation);                                                                                                          |
|(C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any  |
|of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;                                                                  |
|(D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that |
|exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.                                                                              |
|(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:                                                     |
|(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally     |
|determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the         |
|liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.                                                |
|(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full|
|payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.                       |
|(2) Examples.                                                                                                                            |
|(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review  |
|of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court   |
|review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.                              |
|(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice |
|under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further |
|appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to      |
|contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent|
|tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the |
|taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.                                                                                       |
|(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in  |
|full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full     |
|payment.                                                                                                                                 |
|(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under |
|11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).                                                                                                     |
|(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by   |
|any Federal agency.                                                                                                                      |
|(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management |
|or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment;  |
|and similar positions).                                                                                                                  |
|This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or |
|Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.                   |
|(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror   |
|learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.                   |
|(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an     |
|award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors          |
|responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting |
|Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.                                                                                           |
|(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good    |
|faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to     |
|exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.                                 |
|                                                                                                                                         |
|(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making |
|award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available |
|to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.      (End of         |
|provision)                                                                                                                               |

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD-Methodology and Factors for Award

M.1 Basis for Award. This is a best value, FFP IDIQ acquisition, wherein the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical
performance or reduced risk than in making an award at the lowest price. The Government will award a performance-based FFP/IDIQ contract
resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the
Government, price and other factors will be considered as indicated above.

As the non-price factors become more equal, price may become the deciding factor for award. Non-price factors will be evaluated using an
adjectival rating system.

An initial review of the offeror(s) proposals will be made to determine if proposals conform to the instructions detailed in the solicitation.
The Government may solicit clarification questions of offeror(s) after the initial proposal review.  Incomplete proposals and failure of
proposals to conform to the solicitation instructions may be grounds for exclusions of the proposal from further consideration. At the
conclusion of the initial proposal review, a comprehensive evaluation as detailed in the solicitation will be made of offerors proposals not
excluded from further consideration.

The Government reserves the right to limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit efficient
competition among the most highly rated proposals. The Government may also limit the discussions/negotiations with the Offeror’s in the
competitive range to purely technical and /or cost and price issues in the interest of efficiency. While the Government may elect to establish a
competitive range it does not preclude the Government from awarding without discussions.

The Government may seek clarification of proposals and award without discussions as described in FAR 15.306 (a).  When seeking clarifications,
offerors shall not be allowed to make any changes to their proposals.  Clarifications do not constitute discussions.

If discussions are conducted, they will be held with firms in the competitive range in order to advise them of significant weaknesses or
deficiencies in their proposals. Upon conclusion of discussions, offerors in the competitive range will be provided a reasonable opportunity to
submit any price or technical revisions to their proposals that may result from the discussions.

Technical Evaluation Methodology. The technical evaluation methodology will utilize an adjectival rating for each evaluation element.  The
methodology will be based on the following adjectival and narratives, Excellent, Very Good Acceptable, Poor, and Unacceptable.

M.2 Evaluation Method


M.2.1 TECHNICAL EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
The technical evaluation methodology will utilize an adjectival rating for each evaluation element.  The methodology will be based on the
following adjectival and narratives, Excellent, Very Good Acceptable, Poor, and Unacceptable.

|Rating                            |Definition                                                                                           |
|E        |Excellent               |The proposal contains several strengths; most are significant, with no deficiencies or weaknesses.   |
|         |Low Risk                |Based on information provided, there is no doubt that the contractor demonstrates an exceptional     |
|         |                        |understanding of the services required to meet or exceed most contract requirements. The highest     |
|         |                        |quality of contract performance is anticipated.                                                      |
|VG       |Very Good               |The proposal contains strengths, some are significant, and may contain minimal minor weaknesses that |
|         |Low to Moderate Risk    |do not require discussions, and no deficiencies.  Based on the information provided, there is little |
|         |                        |doubt that the contractor demonstrates a high quality of understanding of the services required to   |
|         |                        |meet or exceed some contract requirements.                                                           |
|A        |Acceptable              |The proposal contains no or very few strengths, may contain some minor weaknesses that will not      |
|         |Moderate Risk           |prevent successful completion of the contract, and no deficiencies.  Based on the information        |
|         |                        |provided, the contractor demonstrates the minimum level of understanding of the services required to |
|         |                        |meet contract requirements. Contractor adheres to PWS requirements.                                  |
|P        |Poor                    |The proposal contains deficiencies and/or a number of significant weaknesses that may prevent        |
|         |Unknown Risk            |successful completion of the contract but could contain strengths. Based on information provided,    |
|         |                        |there is doubt that the contractor understands the services required to meet the contract            |
|         |                        |requirements. Requirement/services can be met only with major changes to the proposal.               |
|U        |Unacceptable            |The proposal has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions, and many significant weaknesses, with     |
|         |High Risk               |minimal or no strengths.  The proposal demonstrates the contractor's failure to understand much of   |
|         |                        |the scope of work necessary to perform the required tasks, failure to provide a reasonable, logical  |
|         |                        |approach to fulfilling much of the government's requirements or failure to meet many personnel       |
|         |                        |requirements in the solicitation. When applying this adjective to a proposal as a whole, the         |
|         |                        |technical proposal would have to be so unacceptable in one or more areas that it would have to be    |
|         |                        |completely revised in order to attempt to make it other than unacceptable.                           |
|         |                        |An “Unacceptable” rating for any subfactor(s) will be carried to the factor level, making the entire |
|         |                        |proposal unacceptable.                                                                               |


M.2.1.1 PAST PERFORMANCE.  The following categorical descriptions shall be used to derive an adjectival evaluation of the offeror’s Past
Performance:

Excellent / Low Risk
Highly relevant past performance record managing contracts similar in size, scope, and complexity to the solicitation requirements.  Little or
no potential exists for disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation in quality of performance based on the contractor’s past
performance.


Very Good / Low to Moderate Risk
Highly relevant or relevant past performance record managing contracts similar in size, scope, and complexity to the solicitation requirements.
Some potential exists for disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation in quality of performance based on the contractor’s past
performance.

Marginal / Moderate Risk
Somewhat relevant past performance record managing contracts similar in size, scope, and complexity to the solicitation requirements.  Some
potential exists for disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation in quality of performance based on the contractor’s past
performance.

Unacceptable / High Risk
Highly relevant, relevant, or somewhat relevant past performance exist however; significant potential exists for disruption of schedule,
increase in cost, or degradation in quality of performance based on the contractor’s past performance.  An “Unacceptable” rating for past
performance makes a contractor ineligible for award.

Neutral
No record of relevant past performance exists or past performance history is not available.

M.2.1.2 PAST EXPERIENCE. The following categorical descriptions shall be used to derive an adjectival evaluation of the offeror’s Past
Experience:

Excellent
Extensive experience exists managing contracts similar in size, scope and complexity to that contemplated by the solicitation. Little or no
potential exists for disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.

Good
Better than adequate experience exists managing contracts similar in size, scope, and complexity to that contemplated by the solicitation.
Minimal potential exists for disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance.

Satisfactory
Adequate experience exists managing contracts similar in size, scope and complexity to that contemplated by the solicitation. Some potential
exist for disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance, which may be mitigated, however, by special contractor
emphasis and close Government monitoring.

Unsatisfactory
Limited experience exists managing contracts similar in size, scope, and complexity to that contemplated by the solicitation. Significant
potential exists for disruption of schedule, increase in cost, or degradation of performance even with special contractor emphasis and close
Government monitoring.


M.2.2 EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
The Government will evaluate the Contractors compliance with the RFP instructions in Section L and M. The Government will evaluate the
contractors understanding of the scope and requirements as set forth in Section C.  Competitive negotiated best value trade off technical
evaluation procedures will be used to evaluate proposals, and award will be made to the responsible firm offering the best value to the
Government after evaluation of both the total evaluated contract price and non-priced technical factors. Proposals must be submitted in the
requested format and adhere to the specified page limitations.

Relative Order of Importance of Evaluation Factors

Evaluation Factors are in descending order of importance. Factor 1- Management Solution sub-factors (a-c) are of equal in importance.

   1. Management Solution
        a. Technical Approach
        b. Management Approach
        c. Transition Plan
   2. Quality Assurance Plan (QASP)
   3. Past Performance
   4. Past Experience
   5. Price

All non-price factors are listed in descending order of importance. All non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than
price.  As proposals become more technically equal, price becomes more important.


THE GOVERNMENT WILL EVALUATE ALL PROPOSALS AGAINST THE FOLLOWING FACTORS:   The evaluation will be based on the offerors written proposal.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS

Factor 1- Management Solution
The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed management solution to assess the offeror’s comprehensive understanding of the IRS program
requirements and their approach for managing this effort to ensure the objectives, requirements, constraints and performance standards are met.
This will be achieved through the evaluation of the sub-factors identified below:

Sub-Factor (a) Technical Approach
Offerors will be evaluated on their demonstration of design philosophies, operational frameworks, and the management of relationships and
business processes that will foster successful achievement of all objectives detailed in the RFP. Offerors will also be evaluated on the
proposed technological innovations designed to enhance the IRS Middleware Operation & Maintenance Services as well as the following: problem
solving techniques, methodologies and techniques, risk in schedule and quality of performance.

The Government will further evaluate the Offeror’s proposal technical approach to satisfying the capabilities, requirements, constraints,
performance objectives, performance measurements, and performance standards detailed in the RFP.

Sub Factor (b) Management - Approach
The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed management approach and comprehensive understanding of the IRS program requirements. The
Government will evaluate the Offeror’s identification and addressing of significant difficulties and obstacles in performing the PWS.

The offeror will be evaluated on the strengths and core competencies on how the proposed management approach and core competencies will meet the
IRS requirements.  The Government will evaluate how the offeror’s proposed management approach contributes to the efficient use of materials and
human resources. The Government will evaluate how the offeror clearly demonstrates minimizing the IRS’s involvement in managing the day-to-day
operations for which the offeror will be responsible.

Sub Factor (c) Transition Plan
The Government will evaluate the proposed approach of the transition plan, including: assuming full contractual responsibility for the entire
PWS; mobilization of transition team and project office; specific transition tasks to be executed and how they will be managed; proposed
approach in addressing timing, sequence and interdependencies of tasks; proposed principal transition team members, including employee position,
start date, and responsibilities; the offeror’s described interfaces with IRS and the offeror’s coordination with the current contractor, and if
transfer of existing IRS databases to other hardware/software formats is proposed, the offeror will be evaluated on the explanation on how and
when the proposed formats/systems and their capabilities will be demonstrated prior to effecting any transfer; the offeror’s identification of
any risks to the transition effort and included mitigation and contingency plans in the event the transition cannot be executed on schedule;
specific measures and metrics to be used to monitor and evaluate the transition activities, work plan which identifies milestones, measurable
tasks, and resources required; the offeror’s proposed approach to identifying specific measures and metrics to be used to ensure that system
performance and response times are not degraded during the transition period.

Factor 2 - Quality Assurance Plan
The offeror will be evaluated on the proposed implementation of the quality management/quality control system(s).  The Government will evaluate
how the proposed system(s) will control the quality of the services delivered and how it will meet the priorities and performance expectation of
IRS.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed quality assurance approach it considers to be essential to the successful
accomplishment of the work being performed under each task of the PWS.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed plan to recruit and
retain personnel to support the efforts of the PWS.

The Government will evaluate the proposed Quality Assurance Plan for the work to be conducted under this contract and outlined strategy and
identified mechanisms for ensuring that all products and services meet quality standards for completeness, accuracy, and timeliness.

The Government will evaluate the offeror’s understanding and quality control methods to ensure satisfactory service under the contract.  The
offeror will be evaluated on its demonstration on how it will manage the Quality Assurance (QA) program and perform QA functions such as
configuration management, the application of industry standards, use of best practices, version control, security monitoring, preventive
maintenance, training for personnel and monitoring techniques (e.g., inspection regimen, customer input, and audits) they will use to ensure the
effectiveness of such QA activities.

In addition, the Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated understanding to provide a extensive and comprehensive Quality Assurance
Surveillance Plan which encompasses performance measures, metrics and all elements identified in the (Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
Elements – See Attachments ), as well as incentives and disincentives which will permit IRS to measure and evaluate the Offeror’s success in
meeting and exceeding the performance objectives.

Factor 3 - Past Performance
The Offeror will be evaluated on its past performance. The Government will conduct an assessment of the Offeror’s past performance for contracts
that meet the currency and relevancy standards established by the Government, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of
the required effort.

The source of information regarding past performance, the context of the data and general trends in performance will be considered.

The Government may use information provided by the Offeror in its proposal submission, information in both Government and commercial databases.
Information obtained through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database and any other sources deemed appropriate, may be
used by the Government in conducting past performance evaluations.  Also, a Past Performance Questionnaire, (see attachment), will be used by
the Government to collect information from the three references identified by the Offeror.  The Government will assign an overall adjectival
rating for past performance for each Offeror.  The Government will (1) analyze the historical facts of the Offeror’s work performance and
observations made by both the Offeror and its customers on that performance, (2) make qualitative judgments about the facts and observations,
and (3) assign an overall adjectival rating for the Offeror’s past performance.

Contactors must provide 3 contract references for work performed during the past 3 years, for either active or completed contracts, that are
relevant in demonstrating their performance of the requirements of the solicitation. Past or current contracts may include federal, state, and
local government and private for efforts similar to the government requirement. For each contract referenced, contractors must provide a
narrative response which describes the size, scope, and complexity of the contract. The narrative response must clearly demonstrate why the
contracts are relevant to the requirements contemplated by the solicitation. Contracts referenced may include those entered into by the federal
government, state and local government, and/or commercial customers. Contractors must describe any problems encountered in the performance of
the referenced contracts and must also describe any corrective action taken to remedy the problems and whether the corrective action was
effective. It is the contractor’s responsibility to ensure that addresses and telephone numbers of individuals referenced are current.  The
contractor will receive a neutral score if no past performance information is available.

Interviews may be conducted with references provided with client account information.
         
The Past Performance attachments should be filled out by the offerors, and then sent to three (3) customers for their input. The completed
questionnaire should then be emailed by the customer to the Contract Specialist Laquisha.L.Levy@irs.gov

Factor 4 - Past Experience
The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s relevant corporate experience to include the selection of key personnel positions and the relative
role of these positions within the program team. The Government will evaluate the Offeror on the availability, experience and qualifications of
the proposed key personnel relative to the tasks specified in the RFP. Specifically, the experience and skills of the proposed key personnel in
successfully managing and delivering services in a performance –based IT managed services environment, and how their experience translates to
lowering contract performance risk.

The Government will also evaluate the Offeror’s commitment to provide Key Staff and technical personnel and contractors including its provision
for replacing key personnel should it become necessary and the approximate percentage of time each individual will be available for this
project.

The Government may use information provided by the Offeror in its proposal submission.  The contractor should address the past experience
elements outlined in Section L of the RFP ensuring that the response is relevant to the customers identified under the past performance
references. Information provided should be on contracts that are current or completed within the last three years.  The Government will assign
an overall adjectival rating for past experience for each Offeror.  The Government will (1) analyze the information provided in the
questionnaire and the proposal submission (2) make qualitative judgments about the facts and observations, and (3) assign an overall adjectival
rating for the Offeror’s past experience.

To be considered relevant experience, the offeror’s experience must be similar in size, scope, and complexity to the work that is required in
this solicitation.

Factor 5- Price
A Price Analysis shall be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b). All elements of the price proposal will be evaluated, to include all
option periods and all CLINS.

For price evaluation purposes, the sum of the unit prices for each CLIN listed in Section B of the RFP will be used in determining the overall
proposed price. This will include the unit prices proposed for the base period and each option period.  The sample project (see Section B-
Evaluation Table) will also be evaluated for price reasonableness.  For the rates proposed in Section B, the offerors shall prepare a proposed
total price which includes the prices for the base and all option years.

An offer that is materially unbalanced in accordance with FAR Part 15.404-1 (g) as to price may be rejected as being unacceptable.

The Government will evaluate to the extent to which proposed prices indicate a clear understanding of the solicitation requirements, reflect a
sound approach to satisfying those requirements, and the prices included in the price proposal are reasonable. If the price reasonableness
assessment indicates the proposed price is excessively high or low, the Government may consider the offeror to have a lack of understanding of
the technical requirements.

An adjectival evaluation of the offeror’s Price proposal will NOT be conducted.

M.3 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (Jul 1990)

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers
for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  Evaluation of options will not
obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (End of clause)
