and one labeled Price Proposal. No price information is to be included in the technical file.

2.1.1 Technical Proposal: Each offeror’s technical proposal will be evaluated in terms of the knowledge/understanding that is demonstrated with
regards to the requirements and/or performance objectives, as well as the reasonableness and soundness of the offeror’s approach. Offeror shall
describe in detail how they intend to meet all requirements listed in the Statement of Work.

Each offeror’s Technical Proposal shall be submitted with four parts:

      (a)   Part A – Contractor Team Arrangements – It is mandatory that the Contractor be solely responsible for all work in the SOW  (Statement
        of Work). If teaming arrangements will be used for significant parts of the work, a summary list must be submitted describing the  roles
        of any teaming arrangements. The Contractor shall provide a detailed explanation regarding  administration  and  management  of  teaming
        partners including how, if necessary, corrective actions will be handled.

      (b)   Part B – Summary of Proposed Solution – The Contractor shall detail its proposed solution/approach for satisfying the requirements of
        the SOW in a manner in which a lay person can  easily  grasp  the  essence  of  the  Contractor’s  design  and  implementation  plan.  A
        configuration drawing showing the specific interconnections of the Contractor’s solution shall  be  included.  Any  outboard  processing
        requiring the use of peripheral equipment must be clearly identified on the drawing. The Contractor shall provide a complete description
        of each item to be furnished, including manufacturer name, model number, part number and software version by providing  a  copy  of  the
        following columns from its price proposal – CLIN/SLIN components numbering, description of all components, quantity and unit of purchase
        for each component only. The Contractor shall provide a timeline of its approach and capability to meet the  schedule  for  cutover  and
        Government Acceptance.


      (c)   Part C – Compliance Matrix – The Contractor shall provide a “Compliance Matrix” relating  to  each  SOW  paragraph  and  providing  a
        corresponding response of “Yes” or “No”. Only “Yes” or “No” responses will be accepted. The “Yes” or “No” response indicates whether  or
        not the Contractor will comply with that requirement. Any “negative” responses shall be explained by the Contractor. The purpose of  the
        Compliance Matrix is to provide a snapshot to the Government evaluators as to the Contractor’s commitment, and ability  to  satisfy  ALL
        requirements of the SOW and to attest to any Government requirements the Contractor is unable or unwilling to perform.  Contractors  are
        advised that by annotating a “Yes” to any requirement in the Compliance Matrix the Contractor is stating full compliance  with  the  SOW
        requirement.


      (d)   Part D – Sample Reports, Technical Information and Descriptive Literature – The Contractor  shall  provide  samples  of  all  reports
        generated by the Telecommunication Management System (TMS) for evaluation of formats and compliance with information field content.  The
        Contractor shall provide all technical information stated in the SOW at Paragraph 1.5.1. The contractor shall submit one (1)  electronic
        copy of descriptive literature, manufacturers and  suppliers  specification  sheets,  technical  information  and  manuals  that  depict
        equipment specifications, operating documentation of a detailed nature or any other similar material. Such literature shall be  provided

      Government repository for contractor submitted representations and certifications required for the conduct of business with the Government.
      Contractors are required to use ORCA as a part of the proposal submission process for this solicitation and thus must complete and/or
      update their ORCA registration. ORCA is located at http://orca.bpn.gov/. Prior to accessing ORCA, contractors shall first register through

this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum,

provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions
of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
  (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for
receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
  (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of
offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the
sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
  (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for
satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
  (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
    (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office
designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is
4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
    (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after
the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting
Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
        (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of
entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
        (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and
was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
      (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be
considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
    (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on
the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.
    (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office
designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the
same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
    (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response
to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received
at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile
offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers,
the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
  (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions
with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However,
the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may
reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor
irregularities in offers received.
  (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific
limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government
reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror
specifies otherwise in the offer.
  (i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.

3.4 Clause

52.212-2  Evaluation—Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
  Technical
  Past Performance
  Price
  Technical proposals are more important than both past performance and price put together. Past performance and price are approximately equal in
importance.
  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

    (1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;
    (2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property;
    (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is
not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review,
this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations;

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly
average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract
period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used
for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies—
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or

  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this

by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror’s relationship with the
Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN

Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require
repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If
repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or
adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights—
    (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
    (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable
delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly
give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence.

sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and
all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the

demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor
shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give
the Government any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which
reasonably could have been avoided.
  (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the
Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with
adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any
amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided

    (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any
contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance
on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review
and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is
current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute
for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the
contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation
and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business
day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and
(C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.
  The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
      (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at
paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that
shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning
of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an
assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR
database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient
other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT
clause of this contract.
    (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at
http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised
more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by
written notice to the Contractor within 60 days.

52.217-9  Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)

  (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 90 days; provided that the Government gives
the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does
not commit the Government to an extension.
  (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.
  (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 years (or 5 years 6 months
if 52.217-8 option is required).

52.247-34  F.o.b. Destination (Nov 1991)

  (a) The term “f.o.b. destination,” as used in this clause, means—
    (1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier’s conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consignee’s facility
(plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and
    (2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee’s wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse
unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage,
demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or “constructive placement” as defined in carrier tariffs) of the
supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail
carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including “piggyback”) is
used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the
requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for “heavy or bulky freight.” When supplies meeting the requirements of
the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from
the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall
ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.
  (b) The Contractor shall—
    (1)(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or
      (ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;
    (2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;
    (3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;
    (4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point
specified in the contract;
    (5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and
    (6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.
