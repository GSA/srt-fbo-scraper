OSC is one of the three Centers of Excellence (COEs) within the Coast Guard’s Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information Technology (C4IT) Service Center, which was established on 9 February 2009.  A primary mission of the C4IT Service Center is to unify the Coast Guard’s information technology support structure and business practices into a single mission support model for the entire Coast Guard.  OSC’s mission within the C4IT Service Center is to provide enterprise software life-cycle support (i.e. design, development, implementation, hosting, maintenance, production operation, and enhancement) of mission critical enterprise software applications.  These applications will support the Coast Guard’s five strategic missions:  Protection of Natural Resources, National Defense, Maritime Safety, Maritime Mobility, and Maritime Security.

Organizationally, OSC business applications and support areas are aligned under one of three OSC Divisions:  The Product Lines Division, the Core Technologies Division, and the Command Logistics Division.  The Product Lines Division encompasses the bulk of the business applications developed, hosted and maintained by OSC.  The Core Technologies Division includes OSC and enterprise infrastructure services (hardware, networks, etc.), enterprise information systems, and Information Assurance (IA) capabilities.  The Command Logistics Division has oversight and management responsibility for all OSC data floors and facilities as well as Command Security operations.  An organizational chart depicting OSC’s position within the C4IT Service Center organizational structure, along with OSC Divisions and the Branches under each OSC Division, and is provided as Figure 1 to follow.



Figure 1: C4IT Service Center Organizational Structure



Historically, OSC IT support services have been acquired under a single contract vehicle.  There have been four competitively awarded contracts for supporting DHS and USCG operational and business systems since OSC was commissioned in 1991.  The most recently awarded Task Order was the Systems Engineering and Technical Services II (SETS II) Task Order which was awarded in June 2005 as a five year (base year plus four one-year options) cost-plus-award fee Task Order.  The SETS II Task Order is extended for a 6-month period from 31 May – 30 November 2010 in accordance with the Continuity of Services clause.  SETS II was a competitive 8(a) set-aside award issued under GSA’s ITOP II contract Government-Wide Acquisition Contract, DTTS59-99-D-00457.    

The SETS II Task Order will expire on 30 November 2010 and the software engineering services currently provided will be incorporated into the Application Product Lines Enterprise Services (APLES) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle.  The Task Orders issued under the APLES IDIQ Contract will include the full range of software engineering services required to design, develop, implement, operate, maintain, and enhance USCG enterprise software applications supporting the six DHS and USCG product lines: Financial Systems, Human Resources Systems, Intelligence Systems, Logistics Systems, Operations Systems, and Enterprise Information Services.

Integrated Contract Support Services

The OSC has multiple contract vehicles to provide services to support IT operations.  A general description of each contract vehicle is provided for reference in the subsections to follow.  The APLES IDIQ Contractor shall integrate and work cooperatively with all Contractors supporting OSC requirements in order to ensure compliance with all Federal, DHS, and USCG regulations, policies, and instructions, as well as the requirements of this Contract.  

Facilities & Data Floor Management

IT support and management responsibility for the OSC data floors (classified and unclassified) and facilities are provided for under OSC’s DHS EAGLE Task Order # HSCGG3-09-R-TWV066.  This Task Order also includes property and inventory management for all OSC property.  

Information Assurance, Configuration Management, and Quality Assurance (IACMQA)

Information Assurance (IA) includes computer security and certification and accreditation (C&A) processes and procedures.  The OSC IA program and associated consultation services are managed under OSC’s DHS EAGLE Task Order # HSCGG3-09-R-002.  The services provided under this task order ensure that IT investments managed by the OSC meet the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) and Executive Order 12958.  The IA consultants will facilitate the IT systems developed, hosted and maintained by OSC through the C&A process, provide oversight and assistance with on-going computer security functions, and provide consultation in the development and maintenance of disaster recovery capabilities.  It is the responsibility of the APLES Contractor to ensure that all development and maintenance activities included in Task Orders under this IDIQ Contract are compliant with DHS Information Systems Security Policy, DHS 140.01 as implemented by DHS MD 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook or National Security Systems Policy Directive 4300B.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Attachment III:  Security of Federal Automated Information Resources, Management of Federal Information Resources requires that all components develop a sound Information Assurance Program.  The OSC has been directed to ensure that all systems follow the DHS 4300A and the COMMDINST 5500.13B or Information Assurance.

The IACMQA Task Order also includes services to support the development and implementation of a CM and QA program in accordance with DHS, USCG and OSC CM and QA policies and processes.  Of special importance is the alignment of all CM processes with the USCG Configuration Management Policy (COMDTINST M4130.11).  CM and QA services provided under the IACMQA Task Order will provide independent monitoring, verification, and validation of APLES Contractor compliance and alignment with DHS, USCG, and OSC processes as they relate to the systems engineering tasking and requirements allocated to the contract, as well as any supplementary Contractor CM and QA processes as approved by the Government.

Services include overall support for IT application and infrastructure users, user accounts management, and business application training as it relates to existing and future computer systems and communications networks developed and supported by the OSC.

Hardware, Infrastructure and Network Services

All hardware, infrastructure and network services and capabilities are currently provided under the SETS II Task Order which expires on 30 November 2010.  The follow-on work will be incorporated into the Core Technologies Services (CTS) IDIQ Contract.  The CTS IDIQ Contract is planned to be awarded 1 November 2010.  The CTS Contractor will be expected to maintain all hardware, infrastructure, and networks for the OSC.  Attachment 6 provides additional information on the hardware, infrastructure and network services and capabilities to be provided under the SETS II Task Order and follow-on CTS Contract.

There will be a division of systems administration and hardware administration duties between the Task Orders issued of systems administration and hardware administration duties between the Task Orders issued under the APLES and CTS IDIQ Contracts.  Task Orders issued under APLES may include systems administration support for the business application including maintenance and enhancement of the operating system (OS) and database management system (DBMS) supporting the application.  Task Orders issued under CTS may include tasking to support procurement, configuration implementation, maintenance, enhancement, and upgrades of hardware (servers, routers, etc.) to support APLES business applications.  

Applicable Documents, Definitions, and Federal Regulations

Information on system documentation, OSC plans and policies, and USCG System Life Cycle Development documentation required for this Performance Work Statement (PWS) can be found in Attachment 1 to the PWS.  Attachment 1 also provides information on Federal Regulations and IT engineering definitions that are applicable to this acquisition.




Scope and OSC Organization

Scope

As a result of Coast Guard Modernization, OSC’s scope of work for the APLES IDIQ Contract is clearly defined to support the six DHS and USCG product line areas: human resources, logistics, finance, operations, intelligence, and enterprise information services.  A description of these product line areas is included in Section 2.2.

The OSC currently provides software development and maintenance support for 51 IT systems within the six product line areas.  As Modernization continues, additional systems within the six product line areas may be transitioned to the OSC for software development and maintenance support.  The scope of the APLES IDIQ Contract will not change with the addition of any new systems as the tasking will directly align to the six product line areas.  Any new requirement that is not within the scope of the APLES IDIQ Contract will be a separate and distinct acquisition.

OSC Organization

USCG System Development Life Cycle/DHS System Engineering Life Cycle Activities

System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)/System Engineering Life Cycle (SELC)

The DHS Systems Engineering Life Cycle (SELC) is a systems engineering framework for enabling efficient and effective delivery of capability to users.  The SELC is used in conjunction with the USCG System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure that C4IT systems and infrastructure projects are managed effectively and that end-state solutions meet user requirements while supporting DHS and USCG strategic goals and objectives.  Together, the SELC and SDLC guide the definition, execution, and management of an interdisciplinary set of tasks required to plan, define, design, develop, implement, operate, and dispose of systems.

The SDLC/SELC is a sequence of engineering phases used to produce, operate, and support C4IT systems.  These phases begin with the identification of need and span all facets of a C4IT system’s life cycle, including planning, acquisition, deployment, operation, and retirement.  The SDLC/SELC is defined by the following seven phases: 

a. Conceptual Planning/Need, Analyze, Select:  This phase is the first step of any system’s life cycle.  It is during this phase that a need to acquire or significantly enhance a system is identified, its feasibility and costs are assessed, and the risks and various project planning approaches are identified.  All C4IT systems shall be approved by the CIO before advancing to the next phase.

b. Planning and Requirements Definition/Obtain:  This phase begins after the project has been characterized and appropriate resources have been committed.  The first portion of this phase involves collecting, defining, and validating business, functional, support, and training requirements.  The second part involves developing initial life cycle management plans, including project planning, project management, configuration management, information assurance, support, operations, and training management.

c. Design/Obtain:  During this phase, requirements are translated into preliminary and detailed designs.  Decisions are made to address how the system will meet functional requirements.  A preliminary (general) system design, emphasizing the functional features of the system, is produced as a high-level guide.  Then a final (detailed) system design is produced that expands the design by specifying all the technical detail needed to develop the system.

d. Development and Testing/Obtain:  During this phase, systems are developed or acquired based on detailed design specifications.  The objective is to ensure that the system functions as expected and that the Sponsor’s requirements are satisfied.  All system components, communications, applications, procedures, security controls, and associated documentation are developed and/or acquired, tested, and integrated.  This phase requires strong user participation in order to verify thorough testing of all requirements and to ensure all business needs are met.  All C4IT systems shall be approved by the CIO before advancing to the next phase.

e. Implementation/Obtain:  The new or enhanced system is installed in the production environment, users are trained, data is converted (as needed), and business processes are evaluated.  This phase includes efforts required to implement/resolve system problems identified during the implementation process and to plan for sustainment. 

f. Operations and Maintenance/Produce, Deploy, Support:  The system becomes operational during this phase.  The emphasis during this phase is to ensure that the Sponsor’s needs continue to be met and that the system continues to perform according to specifications.  Routine hardware and software maintenance and upgrades are performed to ensure effective system operations.  User training continues during this phase, as needed, to instruct new users or to introduce new features to current users.  Additional user support is provided, as an ongoing activity, to help resolve reported problems.  

g. Disposition:  This phase represents the end of the system’s life cycle.  It provides for the deliberate termination of a system to ensure that vital information is preserved for potential future access and/or reactivation.  The system, when placed in the Disposition Phase, has been declared surplus and/or obsolete and has been scheduled for shutdown.  The emphasis of this phase is to ensure that the system (e.g., equipment, parts, software, data, procedures, documentation) is properly packaged and data/records are managed per prescribed scheduled disposition.

The SDLC/SELC process provides for appropriate technical and management reviews at specified decision points in the life cycle to measure the progress of C4IT and infrastructure projects and systems towards successful capability deployment.  These reviews allow for the timely identification and resolution of critical issues affecting the success of each project and system.

The engineering services provided under task orders issued under the APLES IDIQ Contract will support IT business applications executing in the SDLC Operational/Mixed Life Cycle, Operations & Maintenance/DHS SELC Produce, Deploy, Support phase of the system life cycle.  Contractor deliverable requirements shall be mapped to the appropriate SDLC/SELC Artifact defined in Attachment 2.  The Contractor shall provide resources to support any and all phases, stages and deliverables of the USCG SDLC and DHS SELC in accordance with USCG SDLC policy (as detailed in Commandant Instruction 5230.66), DHS SELC policy (as detailed in DHS Acquisition Directive 102-01), and all DHS, USCG and OSC policies, procedures and standards.

Development Methodology

There is a strong relationship between development methodology and the SDLC process.  The SDLC is an engineering review process and practice designed to ensure that key phases are transited through the life-cycle and that key deliverables and artifacts are generated, updated and maintained to support the system over its life.  The development methodology is the specific means used to actually deliver the system and the artifacts and deliverables required under the SDLC.  The key is to define a relationship between the SDLC process and the selected development methodology as to when specific deliverables will be required and reviews held.  

OSC currently follows the Rapid Applications Development/Joint Application Development (RAD/JAD) and Agile Software Development methodologies for development of new applications and enhancement of existing IT capabilities. The Contractor shall propose their development methodology and how this methodology shall be implemented to ensure compliance with legal, regulatory and DHS and USCG Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) requirements. 

The USCG’s rapidly-evolving technological and mission environment demands new and improved ways to:

Share critical business and mission-related information

Respond to the surging and receding emergency mission needs

Service volatile and rapidly changing support staffing needs

Leverage existing information assets to meet emerging mission challenges

Optimize the benefits of IT investments

Provide seamless, reliable and trusted communication and connectivity services to support DHS and USCG missions and comply with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and DHS directives.

Protect the integrity of USCG IT systems, data, and infrastructure.

Provide the USCG with common, enterprise-wide C4IT solutions and services through the implementation of Enterprise Architecture.

Support DHS and USCG modernization and transformation efforts through the consolidation of IT systems support at the designated USCG Centers of Excellence (COEs) and DHS data centers, and the integration of the Coast Guard Data Network Plus (CGDN+) with DHS OneNet.

Provide enhanced support for C4IT governance policies and practices. 

Technical Reference Model

The DHS Technical Reference Model (TRM) governs the range of compliant platforms to be utilized to support requirements for task orders issued under the APLES IDIQ Contract.  Conformance to these reference models is required in the performance of work described herein.  An abstract of the TRM is provided as Attachment 4 to this PWS.

Enterprise Architecture

All USCG systems must align to DHS and USCG Enterprise Architecture policies, standards, and procedures, and (to the maximum extent possible) the technologies detailed in the DHS Technical Reference Manual.  Specifically, all USCG systems shall comply with the following Homeland Security Enterprise Architecture (HLS EA) and USCG EA requirements:

All developed solutions and requirements shall be compliant with the HLS and USCG EA.

All IT hardware or software shall be compliant with the HLS EA Technical Reference Model (TRM) Standards and Products Profile and with the USCG IT Products and Standards Inventory. 

All data assets, information exchanges and data standards, whether adopted or developed, shall be submitted to the USCG Enterprise Data Management Office (EDMO) and DHS EDMO for review and insertion into the USCG and DHS Data Reference Models.

In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mandates, all network hardware shall be IPv6 compatible without modification, upgrade, or replacement.

DHS Geospatial Information System Compliance:  All implementations shall comply with the policies and requirements set forth in the DHS Geospatial Information Infrastructure (GII), including the following:

All developed solutions and requirements shall be compliant with the HLS EA.

All IT hardware or software shall be compliant with the HLS EA Technical Reference Model (TRM) Standards and Products Profile.

The DHS geospatial data model shall be used building to the GII.

All data within the GII, whether adopted or developed, shall be submitted to the DHS Enterprise Data Management Office (EDMO) for review and insertion into the DHS Data Reference Model.

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Implementation of service oriented architecture (SOA) is highlighted as essential to achieving DHS and USCG C4IT strategic goals and guiding the modernization of DHS and USCG system development.  Therefore, an understanding of SOA governance in the context of EA, and how SOA can be used to elaborate the various EA reference models will be required in completing the requirements of task orders issued under this Contract.

OSC, with the approval of the CG CIO, has spent the last 3+ years architecting, designing, piloting, testing and defining the Coast Guard enterprise approach to Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).   The SOA framework developed for the Coast Guard is known as SPEAR – Semper Paratus: Enterprise Architecture Realization.   SPEAR is the defined architecture for the USCG’s implementation of data as services.

Distilled SPEAR to a very simple description, the Coast Guard enterprise approach to SOA is a document and doctrine-driven, asynchronous message based, loosely-coupled implementation of services via XML documents.  By “document and doctrine driven” we mean that SPEAR relies on the doctrine, business documents (e.g. Procurement Request, Maintenance and Procedure Card), and work flows to derive, architect and compose the “services”.   While web services can be utilized at the edges of the network or public-facing touch points (e.g. the Internet in the DMZ), SPEAR is based on the use of asynchronous messages, not web services.

The Coast Guard has implemented a JMS-based Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) from Fiorano as the backbone of our SOA infrastructure.  We have also implemented XML security appliances from Vordel.  The security model for SPEAR is “trust at the edges”, relying on Common Access Card (CAC) authentication, as well as Kerberos tickets from Active Directory logons.   Other options are being evaluated for authentication of outside (external to the CG and DoD) sources.

SPEAR uses document managed state; that is, the state of a business process is maintained in the SPEAR document as messages are passed between component systems in the process.  A SPEAR document must contain certain key identifying information for purposes of routine service requests and responses, but otherwise the XML schema of any given SPEAR document is largely driven by the service provider.  The SPEAR Implementation Guide provides detailed information about SPEAR documents and the routing of messages via the ESB.

All data sharing efforts, enhancements to existing systems, and all future systems to be developed for the Coast Guard should be leveraging SPEAR as their service framework for the sharing and consumption of data to and from external systems wherever feasible.

Data Exchange Model

The development of a common enterprise data model is critical to an effective SOA implementation strategy.  The Coast Guard has adopted the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) as its data exchange model.  In the future, this model will govern how the USCG exchanges data both internally (between USCG systems) and externally (with other DHS agencies and systems), and will therefore conform to USCG data models.  The use of established data exchange models will be required in completing the requirements of task orders issued under this Contract.

Industry Best Practices

It is the Government’s desire to benefit from industry best practices that will extend the architecture to make DHS and USCG IT capabilities more adaptable, agile, interoperable, and mission-responsive.  The Contractor shall propose their methodology for implementing and maintaining industry best practices for IT software engineering disciplines.

Data Center Migration

The USCG may migrate systems currently hosted at the OSC to a DHS Enterprise Data Center.  The Contractor shall continue to meet the requirements of task orders issued under the APLES IDIQ Contract regardless of the location of the system environments.  The Contractor shall provide all appropriate application support for OSC supported systems located at the DHS Enterprise Data Center.  The Contractor shall adjust OSC staffing levels to reflect any change in tasking resulting from the relocation.  

Software Engineering Activities

For all task orders issued under the APLES IDIQ Contract, the Contractor shall provide the full range of software engineering services required to develop, operate, maintain, update and change business applications and COTS software in accordance with the DHS SELC and USCG SDLC. The Contractor shall perform engineering integration across all software components developed, hosted and/or maintained by OSC to ensure the integrity and compatibility of the applications with USCG and DHS enterprise architecture requirements.  IT engineering activities include:

Development of operations concepts, system concepts, system level requirements, and designs for hardware, software, external interfaces, internal interfaces and operations.

Technical requirements development, system analysis, systems integration and planning, and sustainment engineering.

Development of system and software designs.

Design review support for all approved IT project requirements, to include upgrades to existing systems, new requirements for existing systems, missionspecific requirements and new projects/systems and development efforts.

Review and assessment of the future direction of development efforts to take advantage of technical innovations that would result in increased quality, reliability or customer satisfaction for DHS and USCG IT systems.  

Development and maintenance of a set of common engineering processes, procedures, and standards to be applied to all systems developed, hosted and maintained by OSC. 

Preparation of metrics data, status reports, management reports, analysis data and other reports and data to demonstrate progress & status of these engineering efforts..

Adherence to the performance availability requirements specified in Attachment 3 for each individual application supported under APLES.

Reporting the status of activities performed under each engineering category in the MPR.

Project Management

For all task orders issued under the APLES IDIQ Contract, the Contractor shall provide project management that meets Coast Guard requirements and supports the Contractor’s business model.  The Contractor’s project management model shall address overall tasking and SDLC compliance for both development/enhancement and sustainment support activities within specific Product Lines.  Managers shall be technically qualified to manage, supervise and coordinate all engineering projects, sustainment support activities, and day-to-day operations of their respective Product Line business area and staffs.  Managers shall track the resolution of problems, project schedule, cost, task performance, and otherwise report status of business application activities and initiatives.  Managers shall be physically present on-site at the OSC while Contract staffs are performing their duties.

The Government is currently evaluating tools for implementation of Government Portfolio Management at a future date which will define additional standards for cost, schedule, and resource reporting.  The Contractor shall support additional reporting based on future Government requirements, which will be based on OMB A-11.  

Engineering Tasking

All engineering tasking associated with the first five phases within the SDLC and specific designated tasking within the other SDLC phases will be associated with a Project or Release to indicate specific criteria for project management of the tasking.  Specifically, the Project or Release will be associated with a specific scope, have a Project or Release Plan and WBS generated, and will comply with the required documentation and review processes for the accomplishment of the tasking.  Engineering tasking will be required to hold the appropriate reviews as specified within the SDLC for the various phases.  In the planning of the Project or Release, the level of who will conduct the review and give approval to continue the assigned tasking will be designated.  At a minimum, all project initiation or kickoffs and all final product deliver to be implemented in Production will require a government review and approval.  Further, the Project or Release deliverables to Production are required to follow the rigor of Configuration Management and must receive government approval before the engineering change will be introduced to the Production environment in a planned and supervised manner.

Sustainment Support Tasking

All routine, periodic and/or event driven support tasking, normally associated with phase 6 Operations & Maintenance of the SDLC, will be associated with a system support plan or annual maintenance activity plan.  This plan will specify the specific system support activities to be accomplished by the team with an indication of the timing or event that would trigger the accomplishment of the tasking.  Examples are routine system backup, system log monitoring, system metrics capture and reporting.  These type activities would normally be associated with a Standard Operating Procedure to ensure the proper accomplishment of the specified activity.  Additional activities may require some level of planning and testing before accomplishments such as the IAVA patching for the system OS to meet security requirements.  While this is a specific change to the system configuration, it does not necessarily require an engineering rigor but does require planning and a quality rigor to ensure it is successfully accomplished.  Again these type activities should be associated with a Standard Operation Procedure but would also be supplemented with WBS to show the expected to do tasking associated with a timeline to ensure proper communication and coordination with staff both within and external to the system team.  Activities that upon initial evaluation are deemed to require an actual engineering rigor due to code or architectural changes will then be converted into a Project or Release and added to the Engineering tasking process.

Integrated Schedules

The Contractor shall ensure that all parties involved in any engineering or sustainment support tasks are engaged via coordinated communication using an integrated schedule to accomplish the tasking.  This includes parties not only working directly for the Contractor but also the other Contractors and their staffs that may be supporting other aspects of the OSC’s mission and IT capabilities.  The Contractor shall ensure that appropriate integrated schedules are used to ensure that communication and coordination is accomplished within the Contractor’s assignment of tasking.  The Contractor shall further ensure that the appropriate integrated schedule is used to ensure communication and coordination for dependent work they may be producing that affects other OSC Contractors or for other dependent work the Contractor is expecting from the other OSC Contractors to ensure successful accomplishment of assigned tasking. These cross Contractor integrated schedules will required that one party be designated the primary for collecting, merging, publishing and communicating an integrated master schedule showing any and all tasks to be accomplished for the assigned tasking.  The designation as primary does not confer the overall ownership and responsibility for tasking that maybe tasked by the government to other Contractors assigned and working at OSC; it only confers the responsibility for maintaining the schedule on behalf of all involved so the government and the associated Contractors have a single picture and WBS to work from in making decisions on behalf of the assigned tasking.

1 Section 8(A) Competitive Business Development (BD) Program – Small Business Administration (SBA)/Department Of Homeland Security (DHS)
     Partnership Agreement


   a. This contract is issued as an 8(a) Business Administration (BA) Program Competitive award between the contracting office and the 8(a)
      Contractor pursuant to the partnership Agreement with an effective date of October 1, 2009 between the SBA and DHS.  The SBA, even if not
      identified in Section A of this contract, is the Prime Contractor and retains responsibility for 8(a) certification, for 8(a) eligibility
      determinations and related issues, and for providing counseling and assistance to the 8(a) Contractor under the 8(a) BD Program.  The
      cognizant SBA district office is:


                                                        U.S. Small Business Administration
                                                          West Virginia District Office
                                                         320 West Pike Street, Suite 330

                                                        SBA Requirement No. 0390/10/000005


   b. The contracting office is responsible for administering the contract and for taking any action on behalf of the Government under the terms
      and conditions of the contract; provided that the contracting office shall give advance notice to the SBA before it issues a final notice
      terminating performance, either in whole or in part, under the contract.  The contracting office may assign contract administration
      functions to a contract administration office.


   c. The Contractor agrees:


      1.    To notify the Contracting Officer, simultaneous with its notification to SBA (as required by SBA’s 8(a) regulations), when the owner
        or owners upon whom 8(a) eligibility is based plan to relinquish ownership or control of the concern.  Consistent with 15 U.S.C.
        637(a)(21), transfer of ownership or control shall result in termination of the contract for convenience, unless SBA waives the
        requirement for termination prior to the actual relinquish of ownership and control.


      2.    It will not subcontract the performance of any of the requirements of this contract without the prior written approval of the SBA and
        the Contracting Officer.

Office (DISCO).  Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL should submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with
their proposal response.  The work performed under this contract requires employees to possess a SECRET level clearance; and some of the
employees a TOP SECRET level clearance.  The DoD Contract Security Classification Specification, DD Form 254 detailing the required security
classification guidance will be included in the contract award document for all task orders.  A Draft DD Form 254 is included in Section J,
Attachment 4.


H.2.2.      This acquisition does involve access to classified information. No sensitive, operation, or critical infrastructure information will
be disclosed in this acquisition.


H.2.3.      US citizenship is required for all contractor employees working on any task orders issued under the IDIQ contract.


H.2.4.      In the performance of task order work, contractor employees may have access to, view, process, or otherwise come into contact with
information that is sensitive.  This may include certain classified, procurement sensitive, For Official use Only (FOUO), Privacy Act, or other
sensitive information. All contractor employees will be required to complete the DHS Non-Disclosure Agreement (DHS Form 11000-6) and Classified
Information Non-Disclosure Agreement (SF 312) during orientation by OSC’s Command Security Officer (CSO) at the commencement of all task orders
issued under this contract.  The SF 312 is included in Section J, Attachment 6.  DHS Form 11000-6 is included in Section J, Attachment 7.


H.2.5.      All services must be compliant with DHS Management Directive (MD 4300), DHS Sensitive Systems Handbook.


3 Security Clearance Screening and Access


Contractor employees working on any Task Order must complete all applicable forms, including all forms related to the completion of background
investigations to determine suitability.  Completed forms shall be submitted as directed by the Command Security Officer (CSO).  At the CSO’s
request, the Contractor's employees shall be fingerprinted or subject to other investigations as required.  At a minimum, all Contractor
personnel must possess a valid Secret clearance.  All Contractor employees requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to
sensitive information or IT resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work on this
contract unless this requirement is waived under Departmental procedures.


The Contractor shall furnish appropriate documentation (Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) certification will suffice) to the OSC CSO.
Specifically, all Contractor and Subcontractor employees working under any Task Order who have been granted a security clearance by the Office
of Personnel Management (OPM) or formerly granted by DISCO must furnish this documentation prior to the employee commencing work.  The
Contractor shall inform the CSO when application materials are submitted for security investigations. The Contractor shall track and monitor
progress of investigations; reporting all changes in status to the CSO, including active follow-up on all submissions.


Security screenings that reveal the following (but not limited to) may cause rejection of access to Government resources: conviction for a
felony, a crime of violence or a serious misdemeanor, and/or a record of arrests for continuing offenses.


The intent and purpose of security screening and investigation are to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the
Government or to successful contract completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior.  The Contractor shall ensure that each
prospective contract or subcontract employee furnishes all required data in the form and format determined by the Contracting Officer or the
duly authorized representative.


The Contractor shall notify the CSO of any change in employee security requirements and access permissions (due to termination, resignation,
reassignment/transfer to another OSC system or alternate Contractor work site, change in working status, etc.) within ten working days of the
change.  For Contractor employees working at OSC who have been approved for a TS or TS/SCI clearance, the Contractor shall notify the CSO within
one working day of any change in employee security requirements and access permissions (due to termination, resignation, reassignment/transfer
to another OSC system or alternate Contractor work site, change in working status, etc.).


If a Contractor employee comes under suitability investigation, (see COMDTINST M5520.12 (series) Personnel Security Program) the Contractor
shall abide by the USCG Personnel Security Officer decision.  This may include the removal of the employee from work performed under this
Contract and/or remove access to classified and unclassified sensitive information pending the results of an investigation.


   a. The Government has the authority to grant, deny, withhold or terminate suitability determinations for Contractor employees.  The Government
      may, as it deems appropriate, conduct background checks or grant temporary suitability determinations to Contractor employees.  However,
      the granting of a temporary suitability determination to any Contractor employee shall not be considered as assurance that full favorable
      determination will follow as a result or condition thereof; and the granting of either temporary or final favorable determination shall in
      no way prevent, preclude or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such determination by the Government.


   b. The Government for a period of up to six months may grant temporary suitability determination allowances from the date that such allowance
      is approved.  All Contractor employees working under this Contract, after the expiration of the six month temporary determination and
      unless renewed one time for an additional six months, shall not work under this Contract until a full suitability determination has been
      completed.


4 Sensitive Information


To comply with the requirements HSAR Clause 3052.204-71, and Department policy contractor employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-
time and replacement employees) under the Contract, requiring access to sensitive information shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis
based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract.  The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the
appropriate background investigation to be conducted.  All background investigations will be processed through the DHS Security Office.


The Government has designated that all contractor employees working on any task order issued will require a National Agency Check and Inquiries
(NACI), as defined by the Department of Homeland Security.  National Agency Checks and Credit Inquiries, until otherwise determined, are based
upon Contractor supplied Position Descriptions (PDs).


The Contractor shall submit to the CSO, Forms SF-85P (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions) and FD-258 (Finger Print Card) for all proposed
employees within seven days after Contract award.  The Standard Form 85P will be completed electronically, through the Office of Personnel
Management’s e-QIP SYSTEM.


The Contracting Officer will use this information to determine whether or not a temporary suitability determination will be granted to allow
interim access to Government resources for a particular proposed employee until a final suitability determination can be made.  Documented proof
of security clearances granted by OPM can be provided in lieu of these forms, is preferred by the Government, and assures an appropriate
suitability determination.


The Contracting Officer and CSO will designate the level of screening for a given position based on an evaluation of risk, benefit/cost, and
feasibility.  The guidelines for reviewing and assigning criticality levels are stipulated in Commandant Instruction (COMDTINST) M5520.12
(series) and COMDTINST M5500.13 (series) Chapter 6.  In order to facilitate the proper assigning of security criticality levels for each
Contractor employee, the Government requires position descriptions (PDs) for all labor categories proposed.  The PDs shall be based on the
contract labor categories proposed, and be tailored to the Contractor’s personnel and management structures.  The PDs shall be submitted with
the proposal response in accordance with Section L.


In addition to providing the SF-85P and FD-258 to the CSO, the Contractor shall ensure that the following completed forms are submitted to the
DHS Security Office for each contractor employees under this Contract.  Forms are to be delivered to the DHS Security Office no less than five
days before the start date of the contract or five days prior to entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor
employee, or vendor:


   a. Standard Form 85P, “Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions”


   b. FD Form 258, “Fingerprint Card”  (2 copies)


   c. DHS Form 11000-6 “Conditional Access To Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement”


   d. DHS Form 11000-9, “Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act”


Only complete packages will be accepted by the DHS Security Office.  Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon
award of the contract.


Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the United States for three of the past five
years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation.


Non-U.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department IT systems
under the contract, unless a waiver has been granted by the Head of the Component or designee, with the concurrence of both the Department’s
Chief Security Officer (CSO) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or their designees. Within DHS Headquarters, the waiver may be granted only
with the approval of both the CSO and the CIO or their designees. In order for a waiver to be granted:

27 CGAP Subpart 3004.1301 - Common Access Cards (CAC) for Contractors:  Contractor Verification System (CVS)


   a. “Contractor employee” means an employee of a firm, or an individual, under contract or subcontract to the Coast Guard to provide services
      and who requires physical and/or logical access to information systems and/or facilities.


   b. Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12 mandates a Federal standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for Federal
      employees and contractor employees.  The Common Access Card (CAC) is a personal identification card for the Department of Defense/Uniformed
      Services and complies with HSPD-12.  The Coast Guard has instituted the CAC as its HSPD-12 compliant personal identification card for
      contractor and subcontractor employees who are required to access a Coast Guard, Department of Defense (DOD), or other federally-controlled
      computer information system and/or facility, or need public key infrastructure (PKI) authentication to perform their contractual duties.
      The Contractor Verification System (CVS) is the automated application process for obtaining a CAC.


   c. Contractor and subcontractor employees working pursuant to this contract who are required to access a Coast Guard, DOD, or other federally-
      controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need PKI authentication to perform their contractual duties shall use CVS to
      obtain a CAC.


   d. The Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) shall serve as the CVS Trusted Agent and is responsible for creating contractor
      accounts in the CVS; approving, returning, or rejecting the CAC application (as applicable); re-verifying assigned contractors every six
      months; revoking contractor and employee eligibility for a CAC; and confiscating a CAC when the contract expires or when a contractor or
      subcontractor employee stops working under the contract.  Absent a COTR, the Contracting Officer shall serve as the CVS Trusted Agent.


   e. The COTR or Contracting Officer shall provide such forms to, or request such information from, contractor employees that may be necessary
      for obtaining a CAC via the CVS.  Completed forms and information shall be submitted as directed by the COTR or Contracting Officer.
      Contractors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted and for any liability resulting from the
      Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete information.


   f. Contractor or subcontractor employees who are declined a CAC via the CVS are ineligible to perform work under this contract.  When an
      employee with a CAC is no longer performing work under this contract, the contractor shall notify the COTR or Contracting Officer on the
      same day the employee stops working and shall deliver the CAC to the COTR or Contracting Officer within seven calendar days after such
      notification.


   g. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when a subcontractor’s employee is required to access a Coast Guard, DOD, or
      other federally-controlled computer information system and/or facility, or need PKI authentication to perform contractual duties.


28 Classified Contract Information


Performance of this contract requires the Contractor to gain access to Classified National Security Information (includes documents and
material).  Classified information is Government information which requires protection in accordance with Executive Order 12958, National
Security Information (NSI) as amended and supplemental directives.


The Contractor shall abide by the requirements set forth in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, an attachment to
the contract, and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) for protection of classified information at its cleared
facility, if applicable, as directed by the Defense Security Service.  If the Contractor is required to have access to classified information at
a DHS or other Government Facility, it shall abide by the requirements set forth by the agency.


29 Observance of Legal Holidays and Excused Absence


   a. The Government hereby provides notification that Government personnel observe the listed days as holidays:


|(1) New Year's Day                                  |(6) Labor Day                             |
|(2) Martin Luther King's Birthday                   |(7) Columbus Day                          |

   b. In addition to the days designated as holidays, the Government observes the following days:


      1.    Any other day designated by Federal Statute


      2.    Any other day designated by Executive Order


      3.    Any other day designated by the President’s Proclamation


   c. It is understood and agreed between the Government and the Contractor that observance of such days by Government personnel shall not
      otherwise be a reason for an additional period of performance, or entitlement of compensation except as set forth within the contract.  In
      the event the Contractor’s personnel work during the holiday, they may be reimbursed by the Contractor, however, no form of holiday or
      other premium compensation will be reimbursed either as a direct or indirect cost, other than their normal compensation for the time
      worked.  This provision does not preclude reimbursement for authorized overtime work if applicable to this contract.


   d. When the Federal and governmental entities grants excused absence to its employees, assigned Contractor personnel may also be dismissed.
      The Contractor agrees to continue to provide sufficient personnel to perform critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be
      guided by the instructions issued by the TO CO or the TO COTR.


   e. If Government personnel are furloughed, the Contractor shall contact the TO CO or the TO COTR to receive direction.  It is the Government’s
      decision as to whether the contract price/cost will be affected.  Generally, the following situations apply:


      1.    Contractor personnel that are able to continue contract performance (either on-site or at a site other than their normal work
        station) shall continue to work and the contract price shall not be reduced or increased.


      2.    Contractor personnel that are not able to continue contract performance (e.g., support functions) may be asked to cease their work
        effort.


   f. In those situations that furloughed Government personnel are reimbursed, the Contractor may not invoice for their employees working during
      the Government furlough until such time as the special legislation affecting Government personnel is signed into law by the President of
      the United States.


   g. Nothing in this clause abrogates the rights and responsibilities of the parties relating to stop work provisions as cited in other sections
      of this contract.


   h. Contractor and any subcontractor personnel assigned to this Task Order shall be granted access to the OSC during recognized Government
      holidays (see (a)) as necessary to provide staffing to meet system availability requirements of the systems supported at the OSC.


   i. The Contractor shall adhere to the USCG OSC’s facility policies on closing or delayed opening due to inclement weather, or other reasons as
      directed by the Commanding Officer through the Contracting Officer.


30 Non-Personal Services


The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services delivered by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal
services.  The parties also recognize and agree that no employer-employee or master-servant relationship exists or will exist between the
Government and the Contractor.  The Contractor and the Contractor’s employees are not employees of the Federal Government and are not eligible
for entitlement and benefits given federal employees.


Contractor personnel under this contract shall not (i) be placed in a position where there is an appearance that they are employed by a Federal
Officer, or are under the supervision, direction, or evaluation of a Federal Officer, or (ii) be placed in a position of command, supervision,
administration, or control over Government personnel.


31 Identification of Contractor Personnel


The Contractor shall ensure that its employees will identify themselves as employees of their respective company while working on DHS/USCG
contracts.  For example, contractor personnel shall introduce themselves in person and in voice-mail, as employees of their respective
companies, and not as DHS/USCG employees.  The Contractor shall ensure that their personnel use the following format signature on all officials
e-mails generated by DHS/USCG computers:


    • Name


    • Position or Professional Title


    • Company Name


    • USCG OSC


    • Phone


    • Fax


    • Other contact information as desired


32  FAR 42.15 Contractor Performance Information


FAR 42.15 requires agencies to prepare annual and final evaluations of Contractor performance.  DHS utilizes the Contractor Performance
Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to record and maintain past performance assessment information.  Once the Contractor is registered and a
performance assessment is prepared by the COTR and ready for comment, CPARS will send an e-mail to the Contractor representative with
notification that a performance evaluation is electronically available for review and comment.  The Contractor can elect to review the
evaluation and submit additional information or a rebuttal statement.  The Contractor will be permitted thirty (30) days to respond.  Contractor
response is voluntary.  Any disagreement between the parties regarding and evaluation will be referred to the Head of Contracting Activity,
whose decision is final.  Copies of the evaluations, contractor responses, and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the contract
file, and may be used to support future award decisions.

           the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions
           of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless
           the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient
           to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.


   h. Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
      simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its
      principals--


     1. ___ are, ___ are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
        Federal agency;


     2. ___ have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
        for: Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a  Federal, state or
        local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or
        Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion,
        violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and


     3. ___ are, ___ are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any
        of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and


     4. ___ Have, ___ have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
        exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.


        i. Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:


           A. The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
              determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the
              liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.


           B. The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when
              full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.


       ii. Examples.
           A. The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court
              review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer
              seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.


           B. The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a
              notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien
              filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the
              taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the
              liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this
              will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.


           C. The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and
              is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to
              make full payment.


           D. The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed
              under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


   i. Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in
      paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
      Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

     2. Certification. (If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision,
        then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.)

        i. The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in
           the corresponding country as listed for that product.


       ii. The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the
           corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether
           forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the
           basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.


   j. Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For
      statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects  to provide in
      response to this solicitation is predominantly--


     1. In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds
        the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or


     2. Outside the United States.


   k. Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with
      respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt
      services.) (The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.)


     1. Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ___ does ___ does not certify
        that--


        i. The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or
           traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the
           course of normal business operations;


       ii. The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
           4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and


      iii. The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as
           that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.


     2. Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror ___ does ___ does not certify that--


        i. The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or

           operations;


       ii. The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-
           4(d)(2)(iii));


      iii. Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly
           average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the
           contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and


       iv. The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that
           used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.


     3. If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--


        i. If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service
           Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and


       ii. The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or
           (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.


   l. Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this
      information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

     1. All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection
        requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations

Offerors must state, as part of their proposals, any exceptions taken to the terms and conditions of the solicitation.  Any exceptions taken
must contain sufficient amplification and justification to permit evaluation.  All benefits to the Government shall be explained for each
exception taken.  Such exceptions will not, of themselves, automatically cause a proposal to be termed unacceptable.  A large number of
exceptions, or one or more significant exceptions not providing benefit to the Government, may result in rejection of the proposal(s) as
unacceptable.  Offerors are therefore encouraged to resolve any potential exceptions or deviations through the clarification process.

of stated claims.  The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the solicitation requirements, but rather provide convincing rationale to
address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements.

Offerors are cautioned that the quality of their proposals and adherence to solicitation response requirements and/or restrictions are
considered reflective of the manner in which Offerers will be expected to conduct this contract and will be given due consideration throughout
the evaluation process.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to emphasize content in response to all solicitation requirements.

3 PROPOSAL PREPARATION


1 Technical Proposal Requirements and Instructions

The Technical Proposal shall consist of the Offeror’s technical approach for satisfying the requirements of the Sample Task Order.  The
Technical Proposal shall clearly delineate the division of performance between the Prime Contractor and the first-tier Subcontractor(s), if
applicable.  The Offeror’s technical proposal will consist of 4 separate sections:  Part 1 (Technical Approach), Part II (Management Approach),
Part III (Quality Control Program), and Part IV (Past Performance).


L.2.3.1.1   PART I – TECHNICAL APPROACH

Page Limitation:  Page limitation: Not to exceed 25 pages. One cover page and one table of contents are allowed in addition to the 25 page
limit.

The Technical Proposal should address each work area in the Sample Task Order in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the
statement of work, including IT development/enhancement and operations and maintenance activities.  General statements that the Offeror
understands, can, or will perform the listed functions without supporting information/narrative are inadequate.  Paraphrasing the PWS or parts
thereof, is similarly inadequate, as are phrases such as “standard procedures will be employed” or “well-known techniques will be used.”  This
section shall be written to enable evaluators to make a thorough evaluation as to whether the services offered adequately respond to the
specific Government requirements.  The Technical Proposal shall clearly delineate the division of performance between the Prime Contractor and
the first-tier Subcontractor(s), if applicable.  The Offeror’s technical approach shall address the sub-factors listed in Section M.


L.2.3.1.2   PART II – MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Page Limitation:  Page limitation: Not to exceed 15 pages; excluding submission of Offeror’s proposed Resumes of Key Personnel (resumes are
limited to 2 pages each), and labor category position descriptions (descriptions are limited to 1 page for each labor category).  One cover page
and one table of contents are allowed in addition to the 15 page limit.

The Offeror’s proposal should demonstrate its management approach with emphasis on the applied use of management controls and IT certification
concepts and policies to ensure delivery of services and capabilities on-time, within budget, and with the required service quality.  The
management approach narrative should contain enough information to indicate a level of thoroughness and detail to convey confidence in the
proposed management plan.  The Offeror’s proposed organizational structure and staffing should clearly demonstrate the Offeror’s ability to
successfully accomplish all tasking in the Sample Task Order.  The Offeror must provide a Staffing Matix in the proposal response, as described
in the APLES IDIQ Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The Staffing Matrix should clearly indicate a mapping of Contractor proposed labor
categories as compared to the Government recommended labor category titles provided in Attachment 9 of the APLES IDIQ PWS.

The availability and existing commitments of Contractor key personnel must be described.  Letters of commitment must be submitted for
contingency hires, defined as persons not currently employed but who have executed a binding letter of commitment for employment with Offeror,
if the Offeror receives award under this solicitation.

NOTE:  The Government reserves the right to contact and use information provided by the references and any other sources.  It is the Offeror’s
responsibility to ensure all reference data is current so that the performance information can be evaluated.


2 PRICE/COST PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS

The Cost Template (Section L, Attachment 4) provides details on all cost elements mandatory for submission by the Offeror.


L.2.3.2.1   Completion of Cost Template

The Cost Template for the Phase-In Period, Base Period, and all Option Periods must be completed and submitted with the Offeror’s proposal
response.  For each spreadsheet provided, the estimated labor cost and fixed fee for the respective period of performance must be stated.  For
the purposes of evaluation, other direct costs (ODCs) estimated by the Government will be considered equal for all Offerors.  The Government’s
ODC estimates will be used for evaluating cost proposals.  Any and all other indirect costs applied to the Government’s estimated ODC’s will be
part of the Offeror’s total evaluated cost and must be included in the Offeror’s cost proposal.


L.2.3.2.2   Cost Template Components

Offerors’ Cost/Price Proposals shall have the components as detailed in the APLES Cost Template, provided as a Microsoft Excel workbook in
Section L, Attachment 4.  Data in the detailed worksheets for each performance period is arranged by system for purposes of Government budgeting
and evaluation purposes.  Offerors are encouraged to provide staffing requirements with the aim of providing overarching Product Line and Task
Order support rather than focusing on staffing individual system teams.  Offerors should strive to develop staffing profiles which promote and
achieve functional efficiencies through matrixed resource assignments by Product Line.

The Cost Template must be completed for the Transition, Base and all Option Periods, and submitted with the Offeror’s proposal response.  The
total number of full time equivalent (FTEs) hours for each performance period are indicated in each table (ex., for the 12-month Option Period
1, 1 FTE is equal to 1850 hours).  The Cost Template must be completed in its entirety.

The following data is provided to assist in preparing cost/price proposals:

        • FY09 SETS II Historical Data (spreadsheet), Section L, Attachment 2.
        • FY10 Level of Effort Budget Data, Section L, Attachment 3.


The table below is a summary of the workbook components.

1 FAR 52.216-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)

The Government contemplates award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract as a result of this solicitation.

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government may use a variety of contract types for task orders issued under the IDIQ contract,
to include:  Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Cost Plus Performance Incentive Fee (CPPIF).
 Each Task Order Request for Proposal issued under this IDIQ contract will identify the Government’s determination of task order type.


2 FAR 52.233-2 – SERVICE OF PROTEST (SEP 2006)

a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed
directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows)
by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from the Contracting Officer.
(b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of
filing a protest with the GAO.

COMMANDING OFFICER (OSC)
408 Coast Guard Drive
Kearneysville, WV 25430

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for
Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.
OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General
Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum,
rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to
file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first
direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party
is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend
contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.
 In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract
number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve
their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent
review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to
that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or
performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the
Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the
information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed
or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:

4 EVALUATION OF COMPENSATION FOR PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES (FAR 52.222-46) (FEB 1993)


Recompetition of service contracts may in some cases result in lowering the compensation (salaries and fringe benefits) paid or furnished
professional employees. This lowering can be detrimental in obtaining the quality of professional services needed for adequate contract
performance. It is therefore in the Government’s best interest that professional employees, as defined in 29 CFR 541, be properly and fairly
compensated. As part of their proposals, Offerors will submit a total compensation plan setting forth salaries and fringe benefits proposed for
the professional employees who will work under the contract. The Government will evaluate the plan to assure that it reflects a sound management
approach and understanding of the contract requirements. This evaluation will include an assessment of the Offeror’s ability to provide
uninterrupted high-quality work.  The professional compensation proposed will be considered in terms of its impact upon recruiting and
retention, its realism, and its consistency with a total plan for compensation.  Supporting information will include data, such as recognized
national and regional compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in establishing the total
compensation structure.


The compensation levels proposed should reflect a clear understanding of work to be performed and should indicate the capability of the proposed
compensation structure to obtain and keep suitably qualified personnel to meet mission objectives.  The salary rates or ranges must take into
account differences in skills, the complexity of various disciplines, and professional job difficulty.  Additionally, proposals envisioning
compensation levels lower than those of predecessor contractors for the same work will be evaluated on the basis of maintaining program
continuity, uninterrupted high-quality work, and availability of required competent professional service employees.  Offerors are cautioned that
lowered compensation for essentially the same professional work may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the
requirement.


The quality and stability of the work force to be employed on task orders issued under this IDIQ contract is important to the Government.
Professional compensation that is unrealistically low or not in reasonable relationship to the various job categories may impair the
Contractor’s ability to attract and retain competent professional service employees.  This may be viewed as evidence of failure to comprehend
the complexity of the contract requirements.


5 FAR 52.237-10 IDENTIFICATION OF UNCOMPENSATED OVERTIME (OCT 1997)

(a) Definitions. As used in this provision—
“Uncompensated overtime” means the hours worked without additional compensation in excess of an average of 40 hours per week by direct charge
employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. Compensated personal absences such as holidays, vacations, and sick leave shall be
included in the normal work week for purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours.
“Uncompensated overtime rate” is the rate that results from multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the
proposed hours per week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20 per hour would be converted to an uncompensated
overtime rate of $17.78 per hour ($20.00 × 40 divided by 45 = $17.78).
(b) For any proposed hours against which an uncompensated overtime rate is applied, the Offeror shall identify in its proposal the hours in
excess of an average of 40 hours per week, by labor category at the same level of detail as compensated hours, and the uncompensated overtime
rate per hour, whether at the prime or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for
personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct.
(c) The Offeror’s accounting practices used to estimate uncompensated overtime must be consistent with its cost accounting practices used to
accumulate and report uncompensated overtime hours.
(d) Proposals that include unrealistically low labor rates, or that do not otherwise demonstrate cost realism, will be considered in a risk
assessment and will be evaluated for award in accordance with that assessment.
(e) The Offeror shall include a copy of its policy addressing uncompensated overtime with its proposal.

6 FAR 52.252-6 AUTHORIZED DEVIATIONS IN CLAUSES (APR 1984)

Whenever any FAR or supplemental clause is used with an authorized deviation, the contracting officer shall identify it by the same number,
title, and date assigned to the clause when it is used without deviation, include regulation name for any supplemental clause, except that the
contracting officer shall insert “(DEVIATION)” after the date of the clause.

5 HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (HSAR) CLAUSES,
       FULL TEXT


1 HSAR 3052.209-72 DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREsT (DEC 2003)

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will award contracts only to those Offerors
whose objectivity is not impaired by conflicting interests. Based on this policy—

(a) The Offeror shall provide a statement in its proposal which describes in a concise
manner all past, present or planned organizational, financial, contractual or other
interest(s) with an organization whose interests may be substantially affected by
Departmental activities, and which is related to the work under this solicitation. The
interest(s) described shall include those of the proposer, its affiliates, proposed
consultants, proposed subcontractors for more than 20% of the work and key personnel of
the Offeror and any subcontractor accounting for more than 20% of the contract. Past
interest shall be limited to within one year of the date of the Offeror's technical proposal.
Key personnel, for purposes of this clause, shall include any person owning more than
20% interest in the company, and the company’s corporate officers, its senior managers
and any employees responsible for making a decision or taking an action on this contract
where the decision or action can have an economic or other impact on the interests of a
regulated or affected organization.


(b) The Offeror shall describe in detail why it believes, in light of the interest(s) identified
in (a) above, that performance of the proposed contract can be accomplished in an
impartial and objective manner.

(c) In the absence of any relevant interest identified in (a) above, the Offeror shall submit
in its proposal a statement certifying that to its best knowledge and belief no affiliation
exists relevant to possible conflicts of interest. The Offeror must obtain the same
information from potential subcontractors prior to award of a subcontract.

(d) The Contracting Officer will review the statement submitted and may require
additional relevant information from the Offeror. All such information, and any other
relevant information known to DHS, will be used to determine whether an award to the
Offeror may create a conflict of interest. If any such conflict of interest is found to exist,
the Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the Offeror, or (2) determine that it is
otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the Offeror and include
appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded.

(e) The refusal to provide the disclosure or representation, or any additional information
required, may result in disqualification of the Offeror for award. If nondisclosure or
misrepresentation is discovered after award, the resulting contract may be terminated. If,
after award, the Contractor discovers a conflict of interest with respect to the contract
awarded as a result of this solicitation, which could not reasonably have been known
prior to award, an immediate and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the
Contracting Officer. The disclosure shall include a full description of the conflict, a
description of the action the contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate
such conflict. The Contracting Officer may, however, terminate the contract for
convenience if he or she deems that termination is in the best interest of the Government.

                                                     SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD


1 EVALUATION AND SOURCE SELECTION – GENERAL



   a) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications, as described in
      FAR 15.306(a)).  Therefore the Offeror’s initial proposal should contain the Offeror’s best terms from a cost/price and technical
      standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.


   b) Evaluation Factors:  The evaluation factors are Technical Approach, Management Approach, Quality Control, Past Performance, and Cost/Price.
       Section M provides a further description for each evaluation factor and sub-factors.


   c) Relative Order of Importance of Evaluation Factors:  All evaluation factors other than Cost/Price are of equal importance, and when
      combined, are significantly more important than Cost/Price.  Cost significance will increase if technical evaluations approach equivalence,
      possibly promoting cost to a determinative factor.  The Government’s evaluation of the Technical Proposal will be done separately from the
      evaluation of the Cost/Price Proposal.

Award will be made to the Offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the best value to the Government after consideration of all
information.  For the purpose of this solicitation, “best value” is defined as the procurement process that results in the most advantageous
acquisition decision for the Government and is performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis between the technical and cost
factors.

2 TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS AND SUB-FACTORS


1 Factor 1: Technical Approach

The Technical Proposal should address each work area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the Sample Task Order,
including development, enhancement, and operations and maintenance activities.  General statements that the Offeror understands, can, or will
perform the listed functions without supporting information will not be satisfactory.  Paraphrasing the PWS or parts thereof, is similarly
inadequate, as are phrases such as “standard procedures will be employed” or “well-known techniques will be used.”  The Technical Approach
section of the proposal should be written to enable evaluators to make a thorough evaluation as to whether the services offered adequately
respond to the specific Government requirements.  The Technical Proposal should clearly delineate the division of performance between the prime
Contractor and the first-tier subcontractor(s), if applicable.  The Offeror’s technical approach must address the sub-factors listed below:

Sub-Factor 1:  Proposed technical approach supports PWS requirements for the Sample Task Order.

The Offeror’s proposal should describe in detail the proposed technical approach for addressing the PWS requirements in the Sample Task Order.
The Offeror’s proposal should also demonstrate the Offeror’s ability to provide software engineering services to support current and future
software engineering initiatives.  The proposal should include a narrative discussion of the Offeror’s any unique aspects of the technical
approach, including the approach to achieving efficiencies across the contract and all task orders issued.  The proposal should include
discussion of knowledge, experience and applied use of industry best practices.  The Offeror’s technical approach should address the strategy
for evaluating and recommending new and emerging technologies to support DHS and USCG missions and IT operations.  The Offeror’s proposal should
also clearly demonstrate a sound approach to, and alignment with, the DHS SELC and USCG SDLC.

Sub-Factor 2:  Use of industry standard, non-proprietary tools.

The proposal should demonstrate knowledge and experience with industry standard, non-proprietary tools to support IT development/enhancement as
well as operations and maintenance activities in the Sample Task Order.  The proposal should address the ability to adapt the technical approach
to support DHS and USCG tools.  This includes those tools available under Enterprise License Agreements (ELAs) and those identified in the
Sample Task Order.


2 Factor 2: Management Approach

For the Sample Task Order, the Offeror’s proposal should demonstrate its management approach.  Emphasis should be placed on the applied use of
management controls, and IT certification concepts and policies to ensure appropriate management and execution of systems engineering operations
and maintenance and development, and enhancement activities.  The Offeror’s management approach should clearly demonstrate their ability to
deliver services and capabilities on-time, within budget, and with the required service quality.  The Offeror’s proposed organizational
structure and staffing should clearly demonstrate the Offeror’s ability to successfully accomplish all tasking in the Sample Task Order.

The Offeror’s proposal should include a Staffing Matix, as described in the APLES IDIQ Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The Staffing Matrix
should clearly indicate a mapping of Contractor proposed labor categories as compared to the Government recommended labor category titles
provided in Attachment 9 of the APLES IDIQ PWS.

The Offeror’s proposal should identify current information technology certifications held by key personnel proposed, and address the extent to
which the proposed key personnel have committed themselves to work on this effort.  If the key personnel have worked on any of the contracts
used in past performance, identification of those contracts and the role of key personnel should be stated.  The Offeror’s proposal should also
include position descriptions for each labor category and all levels of personnel proposed.

Sub-Factor 1:  Management organization and business model.

The Offeror will be evaluated on their overall management organization and business model for accomplishing the requirements of the Sample Task
Order.  The proposal should address the autonomy of the on-site Contract Program Manager with respect to management of all personnel,
subcontractors, and overall execution of tasking for the Sample Task Order.  The Offeror’s proposed organization and business model should
demonstrate relevant aspects including, but not limited to: proposed plan for utilizing Integrated Product Teams (IPTs), proposed approach to
project planning and scheduling, tools for monitoring, controlling and reporting progress (including the progress of subcontractors), and the
proposed on-site management team for the prime contractor and all proposed subcontractors.  The Offeror’s proposal should describe the role of
all proposed subcontractors in the overall management and execution of the Sample Task Order.

Sub-Factor 2:  Proposed organizational structure and staffing.

The Offeror’s proposal will be evaluated on their proposed organizational and staffing structure, to include: (1) staffing levels that align
personnel by proposed task and proposed labor category, and (2) staffing information to support their proposed level of effort for the tasking
detailed in the Sample Task Order.  The Offeror will also be evaluated on the qualifications, education, experience, and availability of
proposed key personnel. Resumes for key personnel, including past and/or current experience, education and/or training, along with statements of
availability and letters of commitment from key personnel and subcontractors, should be submitted as part of the Offeror’s proposal.  The
Offeror’s proposed staffing structure should specifically address the Offeror’s approach to staffing positions requiring TS and/or TS/SCI
clearances to support certain classified work at the OSC as described in the Sample Task Order.  The Offeror should describe their approach to
recruiting and retaining technically qualified personnel, filling vacancies, and maintaining performance and quality of services during employee
absences.


3 Factor 3: Quality Control

The Offeror’s proposal should describe their corporate quality control program and how the corporate office will evaluate on-site quality
control efforts for the Sample Task Order.  Quality control should address the method of ensuring the quality of delivered IT services and
capabilities, as well as the accuracy of cost, labor, and invoice projections.  The quality control program narrative should also include a
discussion of the proposed methods for ensuring cost accountability through the use of efficient and effective solutions and alternatives.

Sub-Factor 1:  Quality Control & Performance Monitoring.

The Offeror will be evaluated on their proposed Quality Control Program.  The Program should describe the Offeror’s ability to effectively
utilize time, material and staff hours in an equitable manner to achieve the greatest results with a minimum of time and effort.  The Program
should likewise address the Offeror’s approach to continuous improvement, capturing lessons learned, and sharing these lessons learned across
all Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) assigned to the Sample Task Order.  The Offeror should describe the proposed on-site quality control
process, including methods of monitoring performance to meet acceptable quality levels identified in the Sample Task Order, as well as
established performance metrics, and should propose additional measurable requirements and corresponding performance metrics.  Offerors should
NOT submit a Quality Control Plan with their proposal.  A comprehensive Quality Control Plan supporting the Sample Task Order requirements will
be required after Contract award.


4 Factor 4: Past Performance

The Offeror’s recent and relevant performance of work similar in size, content, and complexity to the requirements of the Sample Task Order will
be evaluated.  This evaluation will include past performance of proposed major subcontractors.  The evaluation will consider the Offeror’s
inputs and responses from the Offeror’s customers and references.  In accordance with the FAR, the Government may supplement the information
contained in the proposal with information obtained from other Government organizations and personnel, commercial sources, public information
sources, and if applicable, data gathered during the discussion phase of the evaluation.  Emphasis will be given to the extent of direct
experience and quality of past performance on previous contracts that are recent and relevant to the effort defined in this solicitation.

The Government will evaluate past performance and assign one of the following adjectival ratings as defined below:

Superior:  The Offeror’s relevant past performance is of exceptional merit and highly pertinent to the requirements of the Sample Task Order.
All records indicate exemplary performance in a timely, efficient, and economical manner; very minor (if any) problems with no adverse effect on
overall contract performance.  Past performance clearly demonstrates the Offeror’s successful experience in performing contracts of similar size
and scope.  Based on the Offeror’s performance record, there is an extremely high level of confidence that the Offeror will successfully perform
the required effort, and be responsive to the requirements of the Sample Task Order.

Satisfactory:  The Offeror’s relevant past performance is of acceptable merit and pertinent to the requirements of the Sample Task Order.  All
records indicate effective performance and responsiveness to requirements; a few reportable problems, but with little adverse effect on overall
performance.  Past performance demonstrates Offeror’s experience in performing contracts of similar size and scope.  Based on the Offeror’s
performance record, there is a moderate level of confidence, that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort and be responsive to
the requirements of the Sample Task Order.

Unsatisfactory:  The Offeror’s relevant past performance is not pertinent to the requirements of the Sample Task Order.  In one or more areas,
problems have adversely affected or impacted overall performance.  Past performance fails to demonstrate Offeror’s experience in performing
contracts of similar size and scope.  Based on the Offeror’s performance record, there is a low level of confidence that the Offeror will
successfully perform the required effort.

Neutral:  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available,
the Offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance {See FAR 15.305(a)(2)(ii) and (iv)}.


5 Factor 5: Cost/Price


Offerors are to submit cost/price proposals that provide complete pricing as required to comply with Section L, Attachment 4.  Offerors are
advised that pricing should be:

      (a)  Realistic for the work to be performed;

      (b)  Reflect a clear understanding of the requirements of the Sample Task Order;

      (c)  Consistent with the various elements of the Offeror’s technical proposal.

Cost/Price will not be rated but will be evaluated with respect to completeness and reasonableness based on information submitted in the
Offeror’s cost proposal.  The Cost Templates provided in Section L, Attachment 4 will be used in the evaluation. For the purposes of evaluation,
these templates require submission of information other than cost and pricing data (See FAR 15.403-3) supporting the derivation of proposed
costs.  The overall evaluated cost to the Government may become the determining factor for award of the contract as proposals become more equal
based on the evaluation of the non-cost factors.

The USCG will use the factors below to evaluate all proposals for the Phase-In, Base, and all Option Periods.  The proposed labor skill mix
associated with the proposed labor rates will be analyzed to determine if the prices proposed for the periods of performance are reasonable and
realistic for the work described in the Sample Task Order.

The evaluation of the Offeror’s cost proposals will consider the following:

 1) Completeness


   The cost proposals will be evaluated as to completeness, including the adequacy of supporting data.  This includes the identification,
   estimation, and documentation of elements of direct and indirect costs.  The cost proposals must be prepared and supported in accordance with
   Section L, Attachment 4.


 2)  Reasonableness


   The cost proposals will be evaluated for the reasonableness of the overall cost/price and the individual cost elements.  This evaluation will
   determine if costs or elements of costs of the Offerors’ proposals are reasonableness given the nature of the work to be performed in the
   Sample Task Order, and the supporting explanations and information provided.



   3 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JULY 1990)

Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government’s best interests, the Government will evaluate offers
for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirements.  Evaluation of options will not
obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
