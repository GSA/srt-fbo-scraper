The arbitration shall take place in the County of Frederick, State of Maryland. The arbitrator(s) shall be bound to follow the provisions of this Agreement in resolving the dispute and may not award punitive damages.

Travel Costs and Reimbursement Policy
Domestic Travel Total expenditures for domestic travel (transportation, lodging, subsistence, and incidental expenses) incurred in direct performance of this Agreement shall not exceed the amount agreed to in approved Price Schedule without prior written approval of the SAIC-F Contracting Officer. Domestic travel encompasses all trips within the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the territories and possessions of the United States. Additionally, domestic travel will be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR), prescribed by the General Services Administration, as defined below: Foreign Travel Total expenditures for foreign travel (transportation, lodging, subsistence, and incidental expenses) incurred in direct performance of this Agreement shall not exceed the amount agreed to in approved Price Schedule without prior written approval of the SAIC-F Contracting Officer. Foreign travel encompasses all trips outside the continental United States, except for travel to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the territories and possessions of the United States. All other destinations, including Canada and Mexico, are considered to be foreign travel. Additionally, foreign travel will be reimbursed in accordance with the FAR and the FTR, prescribed by the U.S. Department of State as defined below: Documentation (i.e., itemized receipts) to support all actual travel costs incurred will be provided with each invoice request. In addition, identify all travelers, dates of travel, destination, and purpose of trip. Lodging Domestic and foreign lodging will be reimbursed for actual expenses, not to exceed the maximum lodging per diem permitted by the FTR. All requests for reimbursement of lodging expenses must be supported by a receipt. Domestic lodging per diem rates can be accessed at the General Services Administration website http://www.gsa.gov by clicking on "Per Diem Rates". Foreign lodging per diem rates can be accessed at the U.S. Department of State website http://www.state.gov by clicking on "Per Diem Rates" under Quick Links. Domestic per diem rates do not include lodging taxes. Actual taxes associated with lodging will be reimbursed provided a receipt is made available. Foreign per diem rates include all lodging taxes. Actual lodging expenses will only be reimbursed up to the FTR foreign lodging per diem amount. A deviation from the allowable lodging per diem may be requested in certain situations. Examples of situations warranting such a deviation are: (1) when a conference, seminar, or meeting is held at a hotel that does not offer rates within the FTR, (2) lodging expenses are offset by savings in transportation expenses, and (3) Government per diem rates are not available or obtainable at the destination. All requests for deviations from the maximum lodging per diem rate require SAIC-F Contracting Officer approval prior to travel.
Agreement No. 11XS266 Page 44 of 47

Agreement--Attachment 4 In the event the traveler deviates from the allowable lodging per diem rate in effect at the time of travel, and is not a result of the warranted deviations suggested above, the traveler will be reimbursed up to the maximum lodging per diem rate and will absorb any excess cost over the approved per diem rate. The Subcontractor will be responsible for excess costs and any additional expenses incurred for personal preference or convenience. A receipt must still be provided for reimbursement up to the maximum allowable per diem rate. Meals and Incidental Expenses Meals and incidental expenses (M&IE) for domestic and foreign travel will be reimbursed according to the maximum allowable per diem for meals and incidental expenses as determined by the FTR. Domestic meals and incidental per diem rates can be accessed at the General Service Administration website http://www.gsa.gov and by clicking on "Per Diem Rates". Foreign meals and incidental per diem rates can be accessed at the U.S. Department of State website http://www.state.gov by clicking on "Travel and Business" and then clicking on "Foreign Per Diem Rates." M&IE rates cover expenses for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and related tips and fees. Incidentals are used for fees and tips given to porters, baggage carriers, bellhops, hotel maids, and dining room stewards/stewardesses. The allowance for M&IE on the first and last day of travel will be 75% of the applicable M&IE rate for both domestic and foreign travel. Specifically excluded costs that are nonreimbursable are alcoholic beverage and entertainment expenses, and any expenses incurred for other persons. Airfare Costs For air travel, coach-class or equivalent must be utilized. All travel, both foreign and domestic, must use a U.S. flag air carrier service. In special or unusual situations, airfare costs in excess of coach-class or equivalent may be allowable only upon a written and warranted justification for use of the higher amounts. All requests for accommodations other than coach-class or equivalent require SAIC-F Contracting Officer approval prior to travel. Mileage Costs The cost of using a private automobile will be reimbursed in accordance with the current "Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) Reimbursement Rate" as set forth in the FTR, prescribed by the General Service Administration http://www.gsa.gov. (Click on "POV Mileage Reimbursement Rates.") The rate covers all costs of operation of the automobile. Mileage is based on the standard miles of the "shortest route" as indicated by commercially available websites providing driving directions. Provide the printout from the website used which shows the resulting mileage. Automobile Rentals Requests for rental cars are to be included in the original travel package with appropriate justification. Approval from the SAIC-F Contracting Officer must be obtained prior to any automobile rentals. Costs specifically excluded and non reimbursable are the costs of purchasing extra collision or personal liability insurance, GPS systems, bike racks, or ski racks.
Agreement No. 11XS266 Page 45 of 47

Agreement--Attachment 4 Miscellaneous Costs The use of taxis, shuttles, and other public transportation will be reimbursed at actual cost. Parking and tolls incurred while traveling will be reimbursed at actual cost; however, the most economical means for parking must be utilized. Garage or valet parking will not be reimbursed, unless this is the only option or a special need justifies this sort of parking. Receipts are required for reimbursement of all transportation expenses.

Proposal Evaluation Criteria
K.1. Basis for Award

SAIC-F intends to award an Agreement(s) resulting from this RFP to the responsible organization(s) whose offer(s) conforming to the RFP will be of the best value to SAIC-F, price and other factors considered. Although technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of an Agreement, cost and/or price is also important to the overall award decision.

K.2.

Potential Award Without Discussions

SAIC-F reserves the right to award an Agreement without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not

RFP No. S11-266

Page 5 of 52

necessary. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, SAIC-F reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. SAIC-F may reject any or all offers; accept other than the lowest priced offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. The assessment of the offers received in response to this RFP will be carefully considered against the needs of SAIC-F and the NCI. This assessment is not intended to be a solely mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offer, but rather the product of both objective and subjective measurements and judgments of the source selection officials after consideration of the relevant information.

Background
A.1. General

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center for Strategic Scientific Initiatives (CSSI) has as its mission the task of planning, developing, executing, and implementing rapid strategic scientific and technology initiatives that keep the Institute ahead of the scientific curve with respect to potential new highly productive areas and discoveries. This may involve the development and application of advanced technologies, synergy of large scale and individual initiated research, and/or forging novel partnerships that emphasize innovation, trans-disciplinary teams and convergence of scientific disciplines to enable the translation of discoveries into new interventions, both domestically and in the international arena, to detect, prevent and treat cancer more effectively. Under the leadership of the NCI CSSI Director and Deputy Director, the CSSI Office of the Director (CSSI OD) is responsible for components both within NCI and outside of NCI to carry-out its function of supporting timely execution and implementation of activities that have trans-NCI benefit. Outside of NCI, the Office is responsible for coordinating trans-NIH efforts through implementation of interagency and public private collaborations to enable progress against cancer. For example, the NCI-FDA Interagency Oncology Task Force (IOTF) focuses on the identification of scientific and process gaps in the regulatory pathways for cancer interventions and development of joint science-based approaches to addressing these barriers. Also, the Cancer Steering Committee of the Foundation for NIH (FNIH) Biomarkers Consortium is a public private partnership including NCI, FDA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), academia, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and advocates which plans and implements projects to develop and qualify biomarkers for use in accelerating oncology drug development and improving cancer patient management. Within the Center, CSSI OD oversees several Offices which together aims to accelerate our understanding of cancer and best practices in research and treatment via cutting edge technologies that take advantage of collaborative efforts to transfer knowledge and insights available from a spectrum of basic and applied research through programs and offices that include: (1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program Office; (2) Office of Cancer Nanotechnology Research; (3) Office of Cancer Clinical Proteomics Research; (4) Office of Physical Sciences-Oncology; (5) Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research; (6) Office of Cancer Genomics; (7) Knowledge Management and Special Projects Branch; (8) Center for Global Cancer Health Research. These offices support extramural research programs and lead standards and policy development initiatives with the goal of accelerating advances in biomedical technology and furthering the vision of personalized medicine. The Office of Physical Sciences-Oncology (OPSO) (1) serves as a nexus for the development and implementation of physical science-based cancer-focused initiatives within the NCI and integration of these initiatives with trans-NCI, trans-NIH, and inter-agency activities; (2) enables

RFP No. S11-266

Page 13 of 52

RFP ­ Attachment 1 the initiation and development of new fields of study based on the application of physical science perspectives to cancer research; and (3) facilitates the exploration of novel and innovative approaches to advance our understanding of the physical laws and principles that shape and govern the emergence and behavior of cancer at all scales. In late 2009, the NCI and OPSO launched the Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers (PS-OC) program by awarding cooperative agreements to 12 leading institutions to establish Physical Science Oncology Centers. Each PS-OC (or Center) brings together trans-disciplinary teams from the physical sciences/engineering and cancer biology/oncology fields to assemble and develop the, expertise, research programs, and infrastructure to enable the convergence of these fields. Collectively, the individual Centers makeup an interactive and collaborative PS-OC Network. The ultimate goal of both the Centers and the PS-OC Network is to catalyze new fields of study in basic and clinical cancer research, generate new knowledge, and facilitate paradigm shifting research by utilizing physical sciences/engineering principles to enable a better understanding of the disease at all length scales.

A.2.

Project Goal

The goal of this RFP is to identify one or more teams to build an informatics infrastructure and host this informatics infrastructure in support of the PS-OC Network and larger cancer research community. This team or teams will be responsible for all aspects of the informatics system design, implementation, and support.

Appendix C: Data Sharing Policy
National Cancer Institute Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers (PS-OC) Data Sharing Policy Date: April 6, 2010 Overview: The Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers (PS-OCs) comprise a collaborative network of twelve cross-disciplinary teams to examine cancer using novel approaches ­ based on physical laws and principles ­ that have not been followed in cancer research to date. This initiative fosters the development of innovative ideas and new fields of study based on knowledge of the biological and physical laws and principles that define both normal and tumor systems. The PS-OC Network is unique in the manner in which it collaborates with broad cross-sections from both the cancer biology/oncology and physical sciences/engineering communities. With each PS-OC actively engaged in data generation, characterization, and analysis, the integration of these data sets will accelerate orthogonal exploration by all PS-OC investigators to help generate answers to some of the major questions and barriers in cancer research and support the development of clinical advances. The PS-OC Steering Committee establishes the following PS-OC Data Sharing Policy to achieve two high level goals: Facilitate collaboration between PSOCs for purposes of achieving the goals of the program and establishing a robust PS-OC Network. Disseminate PSOC results in a format that can be utilized efficiently and harmoniously by PS-OC investigators, and after public dissemination; to the broader research community. Each PSOC is fullycommitted to the long-standing National Institutes of Health (NIH) statement on the importance of data sharing as an essential component to the rapid translation of research results into improvements in public health. Therefore, the PS-OC Steering Committee has established a policy of data release and data sharing that supports these overall goals while maintaining the rights of individual PS-OC investigators and the rights and privacy of patients who provided clinical samples to the PS-OC Network. The intent of this policy is to create a framework for data sharing that will accelerate research and data reuse, while not providing undue burden on the participating PS-OCs. It is not the goal of the PS-OC Data Sharing Policy to mandate the creation of a centralized long term repository of data, but rather to ensure that published data can be discovered and accessed. However, in the event of the future creation of such a centralized repository, it is the policy by the PSOC Steering Committee to incentivize (1) the submission of data from each participating PS-OC into this repository; (2) joint use of the data with other PS-OCs; and (3) the availability of mechanisms to publish data generated by individual PS-OCs. Types of Data to be Shared: This policy covers data that are generated as part of National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded PS-OC research. Related data generated under other NIH funds can be shared using PS-OC-defined procedures in addition to the standard guidelines. When possible, we encourage

RFP No.S11-266

Page 47 of 52

RFP ­ Attachment 6

PS-OC participants to publish data generated under other non-NIH funding sources in order to make that data available under the PS-OC guidelines. In the initial phase, much of PS-OC data sharing will focus on descriptions of model systems (i.e., nonhuman), and input and output data associated with these model systems. However, should a PS-OC investigator(s) wish to publish human subjects data, the Principal Investigator associated with the PS-OC investigator(s) must ensure that appropriate human subject protections have been followed as described below: Clinical information collected about PS-OC tissue donors that resides at contributing medical centers is Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Consequently, the transfer of such data into the PS-OC Network and ultimately into the PS-OC Data Coordination Center (DCC) upon its establishment, is covered by the HIPAA "Privacy Rule." Clinical data associated with specimens are to be stripped of direct patient identifiers before distribution by the individual PS-OC to any researcher or prior to depositing the clinical data into the PS-OC DCC. Specifically, the data distributed must be compliant with HIPAA defined "Limited Data Set" and must not include the designated identifiers. Complete HIPAA-defined de-identification, per HIPAA Security Rule 164.514 (b)(2)(i), defines a safe harbor for clinical data that have been stripped of 18 specified data types considered identifying. Clinical data, devoid of the following identifiers, are no longer considered "individually identifying" and are therefore not subject to the regulation. The following identifiers of the individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual, must be removed: Names; o All geographic subdivisions smaller than a State, including street address, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code if, according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1) The geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and (2) The initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000; o All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older; o Telephone numbers; o Fax numbers; o Electronic mail addresses; o Social security numbers; o Medical record numbers;

RFP No.S11-266

Page 48 of 52

RFP ­ Attachment 6

o Health plan beneficiary numbers; o Account numbers; o Certificate/license numbers; o Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers; o Device identifiers and serial numbers; o Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs); o Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers; o Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints; o Full face photographic images and any comparable images; and o Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code, except as permitted by 164.514 (c). Distribution of clinical data must be compliant with the Limited Data Set (LDS) definition at 165.514 (e)(2). The permissible content of LDS compliant clinical data is very similar to HIPAAdefined de-identified clinical data except that more precise date/time and geographic information may be included such as admission dates. Distribution of an LDS requires a data use agreement with the LDS recipient that establishes the permitted uses and disclosures of the limited data and the appropriate safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of the information other than as provided for by the data use agreement. Prior to the establishment of the PS-OC DCC, the individual PS-OC contributing tissue and data will be required to maintain a link between donor IDs and materials, so that longitudinal and outcomes data can be associated with genomic or other types of data. This link will not be made available to data users unless the appropriate clearance is obtained through the Data Policy Subcommittee and PS-OC Steering Committee. Upon its establishment, the PS-OC DCC will maintain the link between donor clinical parameters, materials, and any other type of data deposited in the PS-OC DCC. HIPAA regulations only apply to clinical data being disclosed by contributing sites and not to samples or molecular data generated from those samples within the PS-OC Network. Data Release: Participating PS-OCs are responsible for maintaining access to PSOC data sets. There will be several layers of protected data release. Therefore, data may be released under access control, based on membership to an individual PS-OC, or the general public and publication status. Layer One: Members of the general public will be provided access only to published data. This tier will be publicly accessible and contain only completely anonymized data that cannot be aggregated to generate a dataset unique to an individual. Layer Two: The next tier will contain published data linked to composite genomic and clinical data that are associated to a unique, but not directly identified person. Access to this layer will require researchers and their institutions to obtain access via the Policy Subcommittee and PSOC Steering Committee. These data will be made available to any bona fide researcher for the

RFP No.S11-266

Page 49 of 52

RFP ­ Attachment 6

purpose of biomedical research, once the investigator, along with his/her institution, has been agreed to the provisions determined by the Policy Committee. Layer Three: Members of the PS-OC Network will be given unlimited access to both published and unpublished data; however, this will not include any patient specific data. Layer Four: Members of the PS-OC Network who require data linked to composite genomic and clinical data that are associated to a unique, but not directly identified person will need to obtain access via the Policy Subcommittee and PS-OC Steering Committee. Data will be released in accordance to the guiding principles of web accessible open linked data. It is required that all data be named via HTTP Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), that there be a structured metadata description provided for each data object, and that when data and metadata are dereferenced, they contain links to other related URIs (data objects). While diverse access methods may be provided, all released data should be made accessible via standard HTTP based access methods. The PSOC Network will create a PS-OC Data Integration Working Group with a representative from each PS-OC. The function of this working group will be to establish a minimal set of annotations and metrics for common identifiers for the PS-OC Network; a procedure to ensure that all released data will be reconciled to a set of common identifiers, and to define best practices for linked data publication across the PSOC Network. Except for establishing common identifiers, the PS-OC Network will not mandate the use of specific metadata and data format standards. However, the PS-OC Network will use common identifiers and should use existing relevant metadata descriptions when available. Data Sharing: Each PS-OC will operate top-level registries of data that can serve as entry points for project-wide data discovery. The PS-OC will also define and provide methods of authentication that will distinguish between PS-OC Network members and the general research community. Initially, it will be the responsibility of each PS-OC to maintain and provide access to shared data when requested by either members of the PS-OC Network or the general public. When more institution-independent archiving facilities are required, each PS-OC will provide interfaces and methods by which data may be registered and copied into a PS-OC operated repository. Publication of Data: It is the intent of the NCI and PS-OC to promote the dissemination of analyses of PS-OC datasets as widely as possible. All publications from members of the PS-OC Network resulting from PS-OC funding should include reference to the appropriate award number(s) (i.e. National Cancer Institute U54 Grant number). Users are strongly encouraged to publish their results in peerreviewed journals, but are asked to apply the normal standards of scientific etiquette when deciding to publish results based substantially on shared PS-OC data. Possible Authorship Scenarios: a) Any major PS-OC Network Project paper and any major paper describing the overall findings of the entire PS-OC Network will be authored by "the PS-OC Network." The PS-OC Network member listing will be on a Website provided in the paper and will be included in supplementary information, if available. These papers should include an Acknowledgements Section that specifically thanks the set of

RFP No.S11-266

Page 50 of 52

RFP ­ Attachment 6

contributing investigators who provided the samples and the sample donors themselves. If necessary, the PS-OC Steering Committee can mediate any disputes that might arise concerning authorship issues and/or publication priorities. b) Papers on particular aspects of the PS-OC Trans-Network pilot project that are written by a subset of PS-OC Network participants, that use data from the PS-OC Network, will have the appropriate specialists leading the authorship list, followed by "and the PS-OC Network". The PS-OC Network member listing will be on a Website provided in the paper and will be included in supplementary information, if available. These papers should include an Acknowledgements Section that specifically thanks the set of contributing investigators who provided the samples and the sample donors themselves. If necessary, the PS-OC Steering Committee can mediate any disputes that might arise concerning authorship issues and/or publication priorities. c) Papers that are written by a subset of PS-OC Network participants on methods or processes developed within the PS-OC Network will include as authors only those who participated directly in the relevant area. Examples would include any individual papers that describe a new method or process or technology application. If data from a previously submitted or published PS-OC Network paper are included in the methods manuscript, the authors should acknowledge the PS-OC Network, and are encouraged to acknowledge the appropriate donors, research groups and tissue sample providers. d) Opinion pieces, editorials and other articles by PS-OC Network participants about the general implications of the PS-OC Network or the issues it raises are not required to include uninvolved participants of the PS-OC Network as authors or in the acknowledgements. Note that all of these papers should include a reference to the appropriate NCI U54 Grant. The PS-OC Steering Committee should be made aware of all intended papers with multiple members of the PS-OC Network in the early planning stages, for information and coordination. The PS-OC Steering Committee will make every effort to offer appropriate advice to maintain consistency in publishing practice. The PS-OC Steering Committee has no wish to control publication, but it is willing to help maintain consistency and promote the interests of all participants of the PS-OC Network. The NCI intends that PS-OC data be released as rapidly as possible after they are produced, with no restrictions on use. However, approved users of the general public as defined in the Data Release Section of this policy will agree that any publication of results or analyses derived from the use of PS-OC datasets will acknowledge PS-OC with the following sentence: "The results published here are in whole or in part based upon data generated by the Physical Sciences Oncology Center (PS-OC) Program established by NCI. Information about the PS-OC Network and its investigators and institutions can be found at http://physics.cancer.gov"By signing below, the PS-OC PIs agree to support the intentions contained within the PS-OCs Statement of Intent ­ Members Agreement, _______________________________________ Jonathan Widom, Ph.D. (Principal Investigator)
