                                                INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS




A.   Disclosure of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)

1.  Contractors submitting quotes in response to this RFQ are reminded that they are required to promptly disclose to the contracting officer
all facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest as that term is used in FAR Subpart 9.5.
(See clause entitled “ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: Current MCC Contractors and Subcontractors Notice, paragraph 13).

 2.  Contractors have continuing obligations to make prompt and full disclosure, in writing, to the contracting officer of any organizational
conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest discovered after submission of quote.

B.  General Guidance

1.  This section of the instructions to Offerors provides general guidance for preparing the quotation as well as specific instructions on the
format and content of the quotation.  The Offeror shall be compliant with the requirements as stated in the Statement of Work.  Furthermore, the
Offeror's quotation shall be submitted in accordance with the Offeror Submission Instructions.  Non-conformance with the instructions may result
in an unfavorable quotation evaluation.

2.  The Offeror’s quotation shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the
validity of stated claims.  The quotation should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide
convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements.  The Offeror shall assume that the Government has no prior
knowledge of their experience, and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's quotation.

3.  If an Offeror does not understand these instructions, then it should write to mcmilliancr@mcc.gov for clarification sufficiently in advance
of the dead line for receipt of the quote to get an answer in time to meet that deadline.

4.  Discrepancies. If the Offerors believes that the requirements in these instructions contain an error, omission, or are otherwise unsound,
the Offerors shall immediately notify the Point of Contact in writing with supporting rationale.

5.  Request for Clarification (RFC). All requests for solicitation clarifications should be submitted directly to mcmilliancr@mcc.gov via e-mail
not later than 2 p.m. (EST) December 29, 2011.  The Government does not guarantee that it will answer any request for clarification received
later than this date.  Requests for clarification that result in specific information necessary to submit quotes will be provided to all
contractors. Therefore, questions/comments shall not be marked with a restrictive legend and shall not include proprietary information.  The
Government is not obligated to provide responses to all RFCs, but will consider them and incorporate changes into the solicitation as deemed
necessary.

6.  Exclusion of Quotes and Communications.

      (a) At any time prior to award, including upon receipt of quotes, the Government may exclude a quote from further consideration for reasons
such as (but not limited to): non-compliance with instructions related to this solicitation; the quote is not among the most highly rated; or
the quote is not likely to be selected for award.  The Government need not notify an offeror that its quote has been excluded from further
consideration nor need it provide the offeror with a pre-award debriefing.  However, the offeror will be provided post-award notification and if
requested, a brief explanation of the basis for the award decision.

      (b) After receipt of quotes, the Government will conduct an evaluation.  The Government intends to evaluate quotes and issue a contract
without communications with offerors.  However, during the evaluation process, the Government may, solely at its discretion, communicate with an
offeror for any purpose, such as to gain a better understanding of the quote.  As a result of such communication, the Government may allow
offerors to submit quote revisions.  If quote revisions are allowed, the Government may, solely at its discretion, impose non-common due dates
for the revisions. In other words, the Government may elect to have a quote revision date for an offeror that is different than the quote
revision date for another offeror(s).  The Government need not conduct communications with all offerors.  Rather, the Government may, at its
discretion, conduct communications with one or only some offerors.  Furthermore, the Government need not permit all offerors to submit quote
revisions.  Rather, the Government may, at its discretion, seek quote revisions from only one or only some offerors.

C.  Quote Structure

1.  The offeror shall submit one (1) paper copy of the non-price quote, and one (1) paper copy of the price quote, bound with the identification
of the offeror.  The non-price and price sections of the quote must be physically separate.  The offeror shall also provide an electronic copy
of each quote, using the format identified below.

2.  Text shall be presented on 8 ½ x 11 inch paper, front only, in Times New Roman or Courier typeface, no smaller than 12-point. Smaller fonts
are acceptable for limited use for graphics, figures, tables, footnotes and legends. Text shall have 1” margins. Where needed for effective
presentation, two page foldouts may be used which will count as two pages for quote page limitation purposes.  All quote pages must be numbered.


3.  The content and format of electronic copies of the quote must be identical to the hard copy quote submitted in response to this
solicitation.  The Government is not responsible for identifying inconsistencies between the two and may rely on either version at its
discretion.

4.   Information shall be confined to the appropriate section to facilitate independent evaluation.  The quotes should be clear and concise,
logically assembled, and indexed.  Pages over the maximum page limitation for any section will be excluded from evaluation.  Page limits shall
include any diagrams, figures, offeror tables, or reference material.  However, page limits shall not include cover pages, table of contents,
indices, list of tables, and list of acronyms.


5.  Electronic Copy Submission.

      a. The electronic versions of text shall be in Microsoft 2010, uncompressed files.  A directory identifying the file names and contents of
each file shall accompany the submission.  The price information shall be submitted as a separate file.

      b. The electronic versions of spreadsheets shall be in Excel 2010.  The electronic spreadsheets shall not be compiled or password
protected. All cells and formulas shall be visible, and unprotected.  Offerors shall not establish links within these files.

      c. All quote data (e.g., graphs, figures, tables) shall be in a format capable of being highlighted, copied, and pasted into another
application using any standard Windows software.

6.  Quote Revisions.

All quote revisions shall be submitted as page changes to the paper copy, accompanied by a complete electronic resubmission of the electronic
file.  Revisions shall reference the appropriate section of the quote, paragraph and page number.  Each revision page shall be identified by
date, as well as by appropriate page number.  New or changed information shall be identified by a vertical line in the margin next to the change
and/or by using redline and strikeout features.

7.  Quote Breakout.

      a. Offerors shall submit the following information, with cover letter:


           (1) Volume I - Non-Price Quote
           (2) Volume II - Price Quote

      b. The paper copies of the quote shall be submitted to: Conni McMillian (Contractor Representing MCC), Contracts and Grants Management
Division, 875 Fifteenth Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20005, 2nd Floor.  For hand delivery of quotes, offerors must arrange for delivery by
contacting the POC identified above, at (202) 521-2692.

      c. The electronic copy shall be forwarded to the following e-mail addresses:  mcmilliancr@mcc.gov and smith-kulleylm@mcc.gov.  Offerors
should not send e-mail with attachments that, when combined, exceed 5 megabytes. Any e-mail in excess of this limitation may be automatically
rejected by the e-mail system or the system may automatically remove and delete the attachments.


D. Offeror’s Submission Instructions




1. Proposal Preparation Instructions


a. Volume 1 – Technical/Management Capability/Key Personnel:  The section shall address the offerors management approach,  organizational  chart,
staffing plan and technical capabilites applicable to the SOW.  For each labor category reflected in  the  schedule,  offerors  shall  include  a
description of the  specialized  experience,  technical  competence,  professional  and  technical  qualifications  and  licenses  necessary  for
satisfactory performance of required services in the SOW.
Resumes shall be provided for Key Personnel. The section is limited to 20 single sided pages (excluding Resumes).

b. Volume 1 – Past Performance References:  The offeror shall provide the information pursuant to FAR 52.212-1 (b)(10), along with a concise
narrative of each project, for three (3) projects of similar nature within the previous three year period. References from institutions that
have characteristics similar to Millennium Challenge Corpration are preferred.

c. Volume 2 – Price Proposal:  The price proposal will include proposed loaded hourly billing rates in the format presented in the Schedule.

 2. Evaluation – Commercial Items

a.The Government will award a Blanket Purchase Agreement resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to
the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government may elect to award a single BPA
or to award multiple BPAs for the same or similar services to two or more sources under this solicitation.  However, only one award is
anticipated.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Factor 1:    Technical/Management Capability/Key Personnel
Factor 2:    Past Performance
Factor 3:           Price

The Technical/Management Capability/Key Personnel is more important than Past Performance. When combined Technical/Management Capability/Key
Personnel and Past Performance factors are significantly more importance than price.

b. Options. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).






                                                                     Part II

                                                               EVALUATION CRITERIA


1.  EVALUATION CRITERIA

Factor 1:  Technical/Management Capability/Key Personnel

The Government will evaluate the methodologies and approaches based on the degree that they are detailed, complete, effective, and tailored to
accomplishing the DCO’s requirements as stated in the Statement of Work. The offeror’s proposed staffing and key personnel qualifications will
be evaluated based on the relevance of their experience and certifications in terms of their proposed role in the project.

Factor 2:   Past Performance

The MCC will evaluate the offeror’s past performance on the basis of its past projects, which are similar in type, magnitude and complexity to
the projects contemplated under this BPA.  MCC’s evaluation of the quality and success of the offeror’s past performance on projects will be
used to assess the overall probability of successful performance for this procurement.

In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the
offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Factor 3:  Price

Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based upon an assessment of the Offeror’s total proposed price, including the base period and the
option periods.

2.Evaluation Methodology


The Government will perform a comparative analysis of quotes and will assess the advantages and disadvantages of each offeror’s quote as related
to the evaluation factors above.

computer processing. The work requires experience and judgment in searching, interpreting and selecting items from a variety of source
documents.

C.4.23   Object Oriented Design/Programming

Transforming an object-oriented model into the specifications required to create the system.  Moving from object-oriented analysis to object-
oriented design is accomplished by expanding the model into ever more detail.  Object-oriented programming is more flexible than standard
programming.  It is an evolutionary form of modular programming with more formal rules that allow pieces of software to be reused and
interchanged among programs.  Each object can then be examined, discussed, modeled, designed, programmed, tested and implemented.

C.4.24   Technical Support

Providing a full range of technical expertise in all areas of computer knowledge.  This includes programming, systems design and development,
systems analysis and other software tasks.  It includes the ability to operate computer systems and associated peripheral equipment including

The use of automated methods for the routing and control of documents and transactions through a process such as procurement requests, personnel
requests, etc.  Also involves scanning and storing information in digital form on computers.  The information may be pictures, drawings or text.
 This process may also be described as the combining of single work units and their (partial) products as they are aggregated in an overall
process, such as data entry to verification to populating a database to query and reporting.  It could be represented in a flowchart or a
process model where each function is shown with inputs, methods and controls from other functions, outputs to other functions that serve these
purposes, and the overall initiating activity and end-product.

C.4.26   Records/Document Management and Information Distribution

Use of automated systems to manage and distribute records and documents.  Records management includes, but is not limited to, data entry,
tracking, archiving and destruction, reporting and security of paper records through the use of automated tools such as bar-coding.  Document
management includes, but is not limited to, records management and the use of automated tools to assist in gaining control over revision cycles,
tracking revision history, setting user authorizations, redlining, multiple department communications and data-sharing, and storing the data
about an organization’s documents to assist in search and retrieval.

C.4.27   Joint Requirements Planning (JRP)

JRP consists of workshops with key end-users for planning and designing a system.  The users are encouraged to do most of the talking.
Information Systems staff translate what the users want into structured specifications and design so that users can understand and discuss the
results.  JRP sessions do not contain technical detail.  They often involve higher-level managers and sometimes top-management.  They establish
requirements and justification for a system and the detailed functions it will perform.  A major benefit of JRP is making executives think
creatively about how information systems can help them.  The workshops cause an examination of goals, problems, success factors and strategic
opportunities in information strategy planning.

C.4.28  Joint Applications Development (JAD)

In the JAD session, several knowledgeable people in the subject organization or in the subject functional area meet for extensive and intensive
discussions and brain-storming sessions.  These sessions are professionally facilitated and discussion/conclusions and disagreements are
formally captured and distributed.  These sessions strive to accomplish agreement or consensus on the topics of the session.  Disagreements are
resolved so everyone understands what the target/new process/function/system will and will not accomplish.

C.4.29   Rapid Applications Development (RAD)

An approach to systems development that incorporates a variety of automated design tools.  RAD focuses on human management and user involvement
as much as on technology.  RAD aims for rapid development of a single, stand-alone system of limited scope.  The use of tools is a necessity for
this path, as are rapid development techniques and features such as time-box management, reusability and user workshops.  RAD techniques are
largely a subset of Systems and Information Engineering techniques.

C.4.30   Feasibility Study

Identifies objectives, requirements, system concepts, and candidate approaches.  It researches possible solutions and analyzes commercial off-
the-shelf (COTS) products available for achieving the objectives.  May include making recommendations on the approach to be taken.  The
feasibility studies will be used by managers to decide whether to proceed with the task.

C.4.31   Cost-benefit Analysis

An in-depth evaluation of a given approach as to technical feasibility and/or the benefits to be gained for a specific cost.  The analysis
involves identifying, developing and analyzing the costs (actual and opportunity) and benefits of a given approach in quantitative terms if
feasible and in qualitative terms otherwise, and preparation of a recommendation to proceed or not to proceed.  The user may require that this
type of analysis occur independently or with other activities comprising a full system development effort.

C.4.32   Business Process Re-engineering

A complete analysis of the processes used to generate desired products and services with a possible revamping of the entire approach.  The
primary drivers should always be the customer’s needs.  These needs ultimately dictate the scope and the level of technology investment.  The
issues that need to be reconciled include time, quality, customer perspective, people empowerment, efficiency and flexibility.  Technology is
considered a potential enabler of the new approach.

C.4.33   Systems and Information Engineering

An integrated set of methodologies and products used to guide and develop information processing within an organization.  It starts with
enterprise-wide strategic planning and ends with operational applications.  It includes activities required for the support of operational
systems oriented to enhancing operations of hardware and software systems to include the collection and analysis of systems information,

11.    MCC52.204-70 CONTRACTING OFFICER’S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR) AND/OR PROJECT MONITOR (PM) (FEB 2009)

(a) The Contracting Officer (CO) may designate a Government representative to act as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR)
to perform functions under the contract such as review and/or inspection and acceptance of supplies, services, including construction, and other
functions of a technical nature. The Contracting Officer will provide a written notice of such designation to the COTR and/or PM and the
Contractor.  The designation letter will set forth the authorities and limitations of the COTR and/or PM under the contract.
(b) Modifications to this contract are effective only if reduced to writing and executed by the CO.  The contractor is specifically prohibited
from performing any work that is outside the scope of this contract without the approval of the CO.  The Contracting Officer cannot authorize
the COTR or any other representative to sign documents (i.e., contracts, contract modifications, etc.) that require the signature of the
Contracting Officer.
12.    MCC52.204-71  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL   (MAR 2006)
Contractor employees and/or subcontractor personnel, while on MCC premises, shall be subject to and abide by all safety and security regulations
of the MCC and shall be required to meet the same personnel security background requirements as MCC employees as outlined in MCC policies and
procedures. 
A.  Contractor Personnel Facility Access Requirements (including offsite MCCNet access)
Contractor personnel hired to work under contracts awarded by Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and require access to MCC Headquarters,
MCCNet, Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU), Foreign Government Information (FGI) or other MCC-Sensitive information must be U.S. citizens or have
permanent resident status.  Contractor personnel will undergo screening (background investigation) for this access.  The screening will
determine the individual’s suitability and fitness for work under MCC contracts.   The background investigation will consist of a National
Agency Checks with Law and Credit (NACLC) for public trust positions.  Permanent Residents must have been in the country for a sufficient amount
of time for the investigation results to be meaningful, usually five (5) but a minimum of two (2) years.
Contractor is required to have all effected personnel execute appropriate security forms (SF 85P, Fingerprint Charts, Releases) and submit to
MCC’s Security Office before access to the facility or MCCNet is approved.  Contractor personnel may work under the contract while the
background investigation is being conducted.  MCC Security Office will provide the necessary forms to the contractor.  (Also see “Contract
Award” below.)
Contractor personnel for whom unfavorable or derogatory information has been developed during the background investigation process will be
presented to the person by MCC’s Security Office and offered an opportunity to refute, explain, clarify or mitigate the information in
question.  If an ineligibility determination is made by MCC’s Security Office, the individual will be ineligible to further render services
under the contract and access to the facility and/or MCCNet will be immediately terminated. 
The ineligibility decision will be communicated by the MCC Security Office through the contracting officer and COTR to the contractor.   The
specific reasons for the ineligibility determination will be made available only to the effected individual directly by the MCC’s Security
Office.
MCC will honor a previous investigation meeting or exceeding the MCC required investigation standard (NACLC) that was completed within the
previous two years.  Contractor personnel may be required to submit updated security forms.
B.  Contract Employees Not Requiring Facility, MCCNet, or Sensitive Information Access
Contractor personnel hired to work under contracts awarded by Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and do not require access to MCC
Headquarters, are preferred to be U.S. citizens or have permanent resident status.  Employment of any foreign national working within the United
States must have been lawfully admitted into the United States in accordance with immigration laws with eligibility to work within the United
States.  Employment of foreign national by MCC outside of the United States is subject to applicable security and legal requirements established
by the Chief of Mission, United States Department of State, and United States Department of Treasury.
The contractor must provide to MCC’s Security Office the full name, date of birth, place of birth, social security number (except for foreign
contractors not issued a number) and home address.  MCC may use this information to screen contractor personnel through various government
databases to determine their suitability and fitness for work under MCC contracts.  Additional forms and background information may be requested
to verify their suitability.  Contractor personnel may work under the contract while the background investigation is being conducted. 
Contractor personnel on whom unfavorable, derogatory or questionable information has been developed will be given an opportunity to refute,
explain, clarify or mitigate the information with MCC’s Security Office.  If an ineligibility determination is made by MCC’s Security Office,
the individual will be ineligible to further render services under the contract. 
The ineligibility decision will be communicated by the MCC Security Office through the contracting officer and COTR to the contractor.   The
specific reasons for the ineligibility determination will be made available only to the effected individual directly by the MCC’s Security
Office.
C.  Contractor Personnel Security Clearance Requirements
The number of contractors cleared for access to classified information will be kept to a minimum, based on operational needs requiring the
individual to access classified information or systems.  The level of access approved will relate directly to the level of classified
information the individual has a need to access.
1.  Personal Service Contractors and Independent Contractors.  MCC is responsible for security clearance actions associated with individuals who
are directly compensated by MCC.  MCC will request investigations and grant as appropriate, security clearances for Personal Service Contractors
and independent contractor (including purchase orders) with individuals where MCC makes payment directly to the individual.   The level of
investigation and clearance granted will be based on the duties performed as compared with the position of an MCC employee in a similar
position.
Contractor is required to execute appropriate security forms (SF 86, Fingerprint Charts, Releases) and submit to MCC’s Security Office before
access to the facility or MCCNet is approved.  Contractor may work under the contract while the background investigation is being conducted. 
MCC Security Office will provide the necessary forms to the contractor and process the background investigation and approve the clearance. 
2.  Secure Contract Classification.  Classified contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements with organizations must comply with the National
Industrial Security Program (NISP).  Under the provisions of NISP, the Defense Security Service (DSS) will investigate and adjudicate security
clearances required for contractor employees to have access to classified information.  Organizations (contractors and recipients) and their
employees not currently participating in the National Security Industrial Program (NISP) and wishing to conduct classified business with MCC
must be sponsored by MCC, another agency, or by company that has been previously cleared.  Once the secure contract is awarded, MCC Contracting
Officer, in consultation with MCC’s Security Office, will be responsible for completing the Department of Defense Contract Security
Classification Specification, DD Form 254.
D.  Exceptions to Investigations Requirements
Contractors are exempt from investigative requirements when working in temporary low risk positions that are intermittent and when not working
on an MCC contract in excess of 180 days in either a single assignment or a series of assignments.  Low risk positions involve duties and
responsibilities of limited impact on an agency or program mission, with potential for limited impact on the efficiency of the service.  Persons
occupying these positions will not have unescorted access to the Department of State or its Embassies, Sensitive But Unclassified, Foreign
Government Information, MCC-Sensitive information, or require logon access to MCC’s computer information network.
E.  Issuing MCC Access Badges
MCC Access Badges are issued by the Security Office to new employees, and personal service contractors and other contractors with permanent duty
station assignment at MCC Headquarters.  Requirements before being issued a badge include submission of required security forms for processing a
security clearance or facility access, and mandatory attendance at an MCC security briefing.  Security briefings are scheduled on the first
business day of the pay period and alternate weeks as determined by MCC’s Human Resources, and are generally held from 8:45 to 10:00 am.  MCC
Visitor Badges (escort not required) are temporarily assigned by the Security Office immediately after these requirements are met, pending
processing of MCC Photo-Identification Badges.
Contractors with the appropriate level background investigation and who are United States citizens may be eligible for 24/7 access to MCC
headquarters.  Foreign national with the appropriate level background investigation and issuance of an MCC Access Badge, will only be provided
unescorted access during regular business hours (Monday through Friday, 7:30 am to 6:30 pm, excluding holidays and other MCC closings).
Contractor employees who have not submitted the required security forms and attended the MCC security briefing will not be issued MCC Access
Badges and their access to MCC headquarters will require them to have an appointment and be escorted at all times while in MCC headquarters.
F.  Work Performance
The contractor shall prescreen all personnel covered under this clause to ensure they initially possess the necessary security requirements.  In
addition, the contractor is responsible to periodically, however, at least annually, review personnel security requirements to assure the
individual statuses have not changed.
Unless otherwise provided herein, in no event will the need to obtain clearances (including access) from the MCC Security Office be considered
an excusable delay under the contract.  In addition, the need to replace personnel determined by the MCC Security Office to be ineligible will
not be considered an excusable delay. 
Failure to comply with the contractor personnel security requirements may result in termination of the contract for default.
G.  Contract Award
Within two (2) business days after notice of award from the contracting officer, contractor shall provide a listing of all personnel (and
subcontractor personnel) working under the contract (unless otherwise stated in the contract) including the information and documentation
required herein.  This requirement does not include clerical or administrative support staff (unless otherwise stated in the contract). 
The listing shall include individual’s full name, date of birth, place of birth, social security number (except for foreign contractors not
issued a number) and home address.  This listing shall state whether or not the individual will need a security clearance, MCC facility access,
access to non-classified sensitive information, MCC Net access, or no access privileges.  In addition, the contractor will provide a central
point-of-contact regarding personnel security issues.  The contracting officer will send a copy of the listing and point-of-contact to the MCC
Security Office.  It is the MCC Security Office’s responsibility to furnish the necessary form and initiate appropriate security action with the
contractor’s point-of-contact.  Once the forms have been provided to the contractor and/or employee, it is the contractor’s responsibility to
assure that all requested information is submitted within ten (10) business days.
