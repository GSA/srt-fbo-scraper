                                                    Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)






                                                           Net-centric Enterprise-Wide

                                                     Emergency Notification Management System

                                                                      (ENMS)



1.  General Description:


The objective and scope of this order is to provide an emergency notification management system (ENMS) to notify DCMA end users on short notice
via phone, pager, email, etc. of continuity of operations (COOP), natural disasters, circuit and enterprise application outages, and a myriad of
other scenarios that may occur on a day-to-day basis.


      1.1 Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) has a requirement for a mission-tested, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), enterprise-wide
      network-centric Emergency Notification Management System (ENMS) for emergency notification, recall and personnel accountability.  This
      system will utilize a centralized enterprise-wide architecture – hosted by DCMA on its NIPRNet – with the capability of delivering reliable
      and secure emergency notifications to all DCMA personnel, including to regions and specific groups.  The planned implementation will
      support approximately 13,000 military and civilian personnel for DCMA enterprise wide, CONUS and OCONUS, from a centralized site(s)
      utilizing existing IP network communication. DCMA also requires the ability to create a 100% hot failover site, also hosted by DCMA, to
      automatically kick in should the primary system become inoperable.
      Operators/Controllers of the system will be spread across several regions. These operators will be able to initiate and manage alerts to
      support all personnel assigned to their respective subordinate units and users.

      1.2 The system is required to be implemented as a centralized enterprise-wide architecture, supporting multiple regions across CONUS and
      OCONUS, with a minimum 15,000 thousand personnel at geographically dispersed locations.

      1.3 The system shall be composed of five critical components.  Initially, DCMA intends to implement the Network Alerting Systems (NAS),
      Unified Notification Management (UNM), Personnel Accountability (PA), and Telephone Alerting System (TAS) components, but requires a system
      that can be easily expanded to include the indoor Giant voice (GV) capabilities outlined below:



            • NAS: A Network Alerting System with real-time response tracking - text messaging and desktop audio / visual notifications to DCMA
              personnel, ensuring anyone connected to the IP network via desktop, laptop, or any other networked device, would be notified
              within a maximum of three minutes of an alert being sent out, with responses from recipients captured and reported in real time to
              operators (Vendor can assume that for the purposes of desktop notifications, there are approximately 60% of assigned  personnel on
              the DCMA network at any given time);
            • TAS: A capability to provide phone notification to  DCMA personnel worldwide utilizing an integrated phone alerting capability, or
              integrating with existing telephone alerting systems;
            • GV/IV: A capability to activate existing Giant Voice and Indoor Voice systems at various DCMA locations.
            • UNM: A Unified Notification Management capability that includes the ability to (i) initiate emergency alerts to any and all
              warning device via single web-based interface, (ii) integrate user data from disparate data sources such as LDAP/Active Directory,
              (iii) manage single repository of emergency scenarios, (iv) manage permission-based access for operators; (v) enable real-time
              tracking and reporting; and (vi) manage integration to multiple delivery devices.
            • PA: Personnel Accountability capability that includes the ability for (i) personnel/users to self-update their information so as
              to maintain up-to-date contact information for emergencies; and (ii) track responses to alert and provide reports that summarizes
              units and individual personnel responses / status.
      1.4 The system must support a DCMA-wide, centrally-hosted and centrally-maintained architecture with distributed permission-based access.
      DCMA Operations Center will maintain unrestricted global access and be able to alert all DCMA personnel as well as define and manage
      emergency scenarios and procedures that will be shared throughout the system.   The system shall provide signals or messaging appropriate
      to Force Protection Conditions (FPCONS), Information Operations Conditions (INFOCON), terror threats, watches, warnings, evacuation routes,
      battle staff directives, recall and other alerting information to meet Federal, DoD, and DCMA specific warning and notification
      requirements. 

      1.5 The COTS system will be installed at a centralized Data Center, behind the NIPRNet firewall, and also will have a net-centric
      architecture supporting DoD networking standards and network security requirements. Specifically, the system shall utilize web-base user
      interface, support DoD standard network ports and protocols, and provide open interfaces to support interoperability. Failover capability
      will be provided to assure a high level of redundancy. The system needs to include provisions for secure communication, authentication and
      encryption using DoD and industry-standard PKI-encryption technologies. The system must be DIACAP approved/certified or have other
      appropriate IA certification, comply with DoD Password Management Guidelines CSC-STD-002-85, and have a proven support for DoD Common
      Access Card (CAC) authentication. Any desktop delivery capability must be Section 508 Compliant (for people with disabilities). A solution
      which is completely based on leased, or vendor hosted, services is not appropriate due to OPSEC and Physical Security issues.

      1.6 Vendor will provide a Software Assurance and Technical Support contract that will include 24x7 phone support for IT personnel as well
      as system operators. Technical support shall include on-site visit in case of critical failures not solved through normal 24x7 phone
      support. The contract will also include all version upgrades to the software (including patches, updates, etc.) at no additional cost.

2. Requirements

      2.1 The contractor shall provide, at a minimum, unless otherwise specified and agreed to in the Implementation Plan, all equipment,
      installation, training, on-site performance and system testing, complete documentation (including product drawings and operation manuals as

                                                    Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)






                                                           Net-centric Enterprise-Wide

                                                     Emergency Notification Management System

                                                                      (ENMS)



1.  General Description:


The objective and scope of this order is to provide an emergency notification management system (ENMS) to notify DCMA end users on short notice
via phone, pager, email, etc. of continuity of operations (COOP), natural disasters, circuit and enterprise application outages, and a myriad of
other scenarios that may occur on a day-to-day basis.


      1.1 Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) has a requirement for a mission-tested, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), enterprise-wide
      network-centric Emergency Notification Management System (ENMS) for emergency notification, recall and personnel accountability.  This
      system will utilize a centralized enterprise-wide architecture – hosted by DCMA on its NIPRNet – with the capability of delivering reliable
      and secure emergency notifications to all DCMA personnel, including to regions and specific groups.  The planned implementation will
      support up to 15,000 military and civilian personnel for DCMA enterprise wide, CONUS and OCONUS, from a centralized site(s) utilizing
      existing IP network communication. DCMA also requires the ability to create a 100% hot failover site, also hosted by DCMA, to automatically
      kick in should the primary system become inoperable.
      Operators/Controllers of the system will be spread across several regions. These operators will be able to initiate and manage alerts to
      support all personnel assigned to their respective subordinate units and users.

      1.2 The system is required to be implemented as a centralized enterprise-wide architecture, supporting multiple regions across CONUS and
      OCONUS, with up to 15,000 thousand personnel at geographically dispersed locations.

      1.3 The system shall be composed of five critical components.  Initially, DCMA intends to implement the Network Alerting Systems (NAS),
      Unified Notification Management (UNM), Personnel Accountability (PA), and Telephone Alerting System (TAS) components, but requires a system
      that can be easily expanded to include the indoor Giant voice (GV) capabilities outlined below:



            • NAS: A Network Alerting System with real-time response tracking - text messaging and desktop audio / visual notifications to DCMA
              personnel, ensuring anyone connected to the IP network via desktop, laptop, or any other networked device, would be notified
              within a maximum of three minutes of an alert being sent out, with responses from recipients captured and reported in real time to
              operators (Vendor can assume that for the purposes of desktop notifications, there are approximately 60% of assigned  personnel on
              the DCMA network at any given time);
            • TAS: A capability to provide phone notification to  DCMA personnel worldwide utilizing an integrated phone alerting capability, or
              integrating with existing telephone alerting systems;
            • GV/IV: A capability to activate existing Giant Voice and Indoor Voice systems at various DCMA locations.
            • UNM: A Unified Notification Management capability that includes the ability to (i) initiate emergency alerts to any and all
              warning device via single web-based interface, (ii) integrate user data from disparate data sources such as LDAP/Active Directory,
              (iii) manage single repository of emergency scenarios, (iv) manage permission-based access for operators; (v) enable real-time
              tracking and reporting; and (vi) manage integration to multiple delivery devices.
            • PA: Personnel Accountability capability that includes the ability for (i) personnel/users to self-update their information so as
              to maintain up-to-date contact information for emergencies; and (ii) track responses to alert and provide reports that summarizes
              units and individual personnel responses / status.
      1.4 The system must support a DCMA-wide, centrally-hosted and centrally-maintained architecture with distributed permission-based access.
      DCMA Operations Center will maintain unrestricted global access and be able to alert all DCMA personnel as well as define and manage
      emergency scenarios and procedures that will be shared throughout the system.   The system shall provide signals or messaging appropriate
      to Force Protection Conditions (FPCONS), Information Operations Conditions (INFOCON), terror threats, watches, warnings, evacuation routes,
      battle staff directives, recall and other alerting information to meet Federal, DoD, and DCMA specific warning and notification
      requirements. 

      1.5 The COTS system will be installed at a centralized Data Center, behind the NIPRNet firewall, and also will have a net-centric
      architecture supporting DoD networking standards and network security requirements. Specifically, the system shall utilize web-base user
      interface, support DoD standard network ports and protocols, and provide open interfaces to support interoperability. Failover capability
      will be provided to assure a high level of redundancy. The system needs to include provisions for secure communication, authentication and
      encryption using DoD and industry-standard PKI-encryption technologies. The system must be DIACAP approved/certified or have other
      appropriate IA certification, comply with DoD Password Management Guidelines CSC-STD-002-85, and have a proven support for DoD Common
      Access Card (CAC) authentication. Any desktop delivery capability must be Section 508 Compliant (for people with disabilities). A solution
      which is completely based on leased, or vendor hosted, services is not appropriate due to OPSEC and Physical Security issues.

      1.6 Vendor will provide a Software Assurance and Technical Support contract that will include 24x7 phone support for IT personnel as well
      as system operators. Technical support shall include on-site visit in case of critical failures not solved through normal 24x7 phone
      support. The contract will also include all version upgrades to the software (including patches, updates, etc.) at no additional cost.

2. Requirements

      2.1 The contractor shall provide, at a minimum, unless otherwise specified and agreed to in the Implementation Plan, all equipment,
      installation, training, on-site performance and system testing, complete documentation (including product drawings and operation manuals as

      troubleshooting, preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance.

      2.2 Server equipment and associated hardware for this DCMA-wide ENMS shall be installed at a Data Center designated by the DCMA IT team.
      The later redundant fail-over hardware and application software shall be installed at sites selected by DCMA.

      2.3 The contractor shall design and install an ENMS that meets DoD and DCMA specific requirements.

      2.4 The contractor shall provide additional technical services (for up to one man-year) during system implementation to assist DCMA
      personnel with deployment, integration and CONOPS development. The technical services will assist with activities such as developing
      customized emergency notification scripts, integrating with existing active directory database, integrating with Giant Voice / Indoor Voice

(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ___    ) are, ( ___   ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or
declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) ( ___   ) Have, ( ___   ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state
or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or
commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating

(3) ( ___   ) Are, ( ___   ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission
of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

(4) (   ___  ) Have, ( ___   ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).


(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

the Government's program plans and actual or anticipated resources; and (3) by virtue of its access to proprietary information belonging to
others, the Contractor does not obtain any unfair competitive advantage.

      b.  Scope.  The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the Contractor and any of its affiliates or
their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as prime
contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity.

products or services, or the products or services of another firm if the Contractor is, or has been, substantially involved in their development
or marketing.  In addition, if the Contractor under this contract prepares a complete, or essentially complete, Statement of Work to be used in
competitive acquisitions, the contractor shall be ineligible to perform or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort which is based
on such Statement of Work or specifications.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude the contractor from competing for follow-on contracts
involving the same or similar services.

            (2)  Access To and Use of Government Information:  If the Contractor, in the performance of this contract, obtains access to
Government information such as plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, or data which has not been released or otherwise made
available to the public, the contractor agrees that without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer, it shall not: (a) use such
information for any private purpose unless the information has been released or otherwise made available to the public; (b) compete for work
based on such information .until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public;  (c) submit an unsolicited proposal to
the Government which is based on such information until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; and (d) release
such information unless such information has previously been released or otherwise made available to the public by the Government.

            (3)  Access To and Protection of Proprietary Information:  The Contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access
to proprietary data, trade secrets, other contractors’ proprietary information, or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or
financial information (hereinafter referred to as "proprietary data") under this contract, it shall not use or disclose such information for any
purpose other than providing the contract support services, and will not use or disclose the information for any personal or other commercial
purpose.  The Contractor further agrees to enter into a written agreement with any other company whose proprietary information they will have
access to, as required by FAR 9.505-4(b), for the protection of the proprietary data  and to exercise diligent effort to protect such
proprietary data from unauthorized use or disclosure.  A copy of each such written agreement shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer.  In
addition, the Contractor shall obtain from each employee who has access to proprietary data under this contract, a written agreement which shall
in substance provide that such employee shall not, during his/her employment by the Contractor or thereafter, disclose to others or use for
their benefit, proprietary data received in connection with the work under this Contract.

      c.  Subcontracts:  The Contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph, in consulting agreements and subcontracts of any
tier when directed by the Contracting Officer.  The terms "contract," "Contractor," and "Contracting Officer" will be appropriately modified to
preserve the Government's rights.

      d.  Representations and Disclosures:

            (1)  The Contractor represents that it has disclosed to the Contracting Officer, prior to award, all facts relevant to the existence
or potential existence of organizational conflict of interests as that term is used in FAR Subpart 9.5.

            (2)  The Contractor agrees that if after award it discovers an organizational conflict of interest with respect to this contract,
prompt and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer which shall include a description of the action the Contractor
has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.

      e.  Remedies and Waiver:

            (1)  For breach of any of the above restrictions or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant facts required to be
disclosed during this contract, the Government may terminate this contract for default, disqualify the Contractor for subsequent related
contractual efforts, and pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.  If, however, in compliance with this clause,
the Contractor discovers and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest (or potential therefore) subsequent to contract award, the
Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience if such termination is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.

            (2)  The parties recognize that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which this clause might be applied in the future
and that the clause has effect which will survive the performance of this contract.  Accordingly, the Contractor may at any time seek a waiver
from the Contracting Officer by submitting a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.  If it is
determined to be in the best interests of the Government, the Head of Contracting Activity will grant such a waiver in writing.

      f.  Modifications:  Prior to a contract modification, when the Statement of Work is changed to add new work or the period of performance
is significantly increased, the Contracting Officer will request, and the Contractor is required to submit, either an organizational conflict of
interest disclosure or an update of the previously submitted disclosure or representation.

Instructions to Offerors - Proposal Submission

This will be a best value award decision.  Evaluation of the proposals will be based upon the following evaluation factors:

    o Factor 1 – Technical
    o Factor 2 – Past Performance
    o Factor 3 – Price

The non-price factors are of equal importance to each other and when combined are of equal importance to price.

PART II – Technical

Offerors must provide written technical information that demonstrates their qualifications to meet all requirements of the Technical
Specifications/PWS (Attachment 1).  This technical information must include the following:

Factor 1 - Technical

Understanding of Technical Requirement

    • The offeror must demonstrate in their proposal a clear understanding of all the requirements specified in the PWS and of the overall scope
      of the project.
    • The offeror must provide details as to how the proposed system complies with DoD/Federal Standards and Regulations as outlined in PWS
      Section 3.0.
    • The Offeror’s proposal must address each of  the performance requirements and identify how their proposed solution meets or exceeds all the
      requirements outlined in Section 4.0, System Requirements:
    • A – General Requirements
    • B – Alerts Delivery Requirements – Desktop Notifications
    • C – Alerts Delivery Requirements – Phone Notifications
    • D – DCMA-Wide / Regional Management Requirements
    • E – Operator Access Policy Requirements
    • F – Alert Activation Requirements
    • G – Alert Management Requirements
    • H – User and Groups Management Requirements
    • I – User Data Integration and Updates Requirements
    • J – Communication Requirements
    • K – Security Requirements
    • L – Weather Alerts Requirements
    • The offerors proposal must address each of the General Specifications of the PWS and identify how their proposed solution meets or  exceeds
      all the requirements listed in Section 8.0as follows:
    • Licensing
    • Deliverables
    • Technology Refresh
    • IPV6 Compliance
    • Invoicing
    • Section 508 Compliance

PART III – Past Performance

Factor 2 – Past Performance

Past performance is an indicator of a contractor’s ability to perform satisfactorily on future awards and is a record of contractor’s
conformance to specifications, quality conformance, adherence to contract schedules, and commitment to customer satisfaction.

Offerors must provide information concerning performance in providing supplies and services relevant to those required in the PWS, for the last
three contracts similar in nature to this requirement, either completed or currently being performed during the last three years.  Offerors
shall describe the relevance of each listed contract to the current RFP’s requirements.  Contracts listed may include those entered into by the
Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers.  Offerors must provide point of contact information for
each contract identified.

The Government will utilize the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov to evaluate contractor past performance
for those contractors having previously performed on a Federal Government contract (s). PPIRS is a web-enabled, government-wide application that
collects quantifiable and narrative contractor past performance information from all Federal contracting agencies and provides a contractor’s
previous performance based on Federal Stock Class (FSC) or Product Service Code (PSC).


PART IV – Price Quote

Factor 3 - Pricing

Provide pricing using the attached pricing spreadsheet (Attachment 2) which includes the basic description of required line items as outlined in
the RFP.  It is up to the offeror to carefully review the PWS and quote all line items that will be necessary for the offeror to successfully
perform the contract.

Evaluation and Award


Proposals submitted in response to this RFP will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth below. It is imperative that
offerors respond directly to each area specified and ensure their proposal is submitted on the most favorable terms, since less than their best
potential could result in exclusion of the proposal from further consideration. Responses which merely repeat the PWS cannot be considered as
being responsive to the requirements of the RFP.  Assurances of experience, capability or qualifications, without a clear demonstration to
support the claim, may adversely influence the evaluation of the proposal.

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.  Proposals should contain the vendor’s best terms regarding non-
price and price factors.  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revisions to proposals if it is
determined to be necessary.  If a negotiation range is established, the Government may limit the number of proposals in the negotiation range to
the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal complies with the RFP, meets the PWS requirements, represents the best value to the Government
considering technical qualifications, past performance, and price.  Non-price factors, technical and past performance are of equal importance to
each other, and when combined are of equal importance to price.  However if two or more offers are tied with respect to their overall (non-
price) ratings, then price will be the deciding factor.

Evaluation Criteria

Part I – Administrative Data

Proposals that fail to furnish the required information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from
consideration.


PART II Technical Qualifications

Factor 1 – Technical

Offerors technical qualifications will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror has demonstrated its capability to perform the
PWS requirements to include:

   Understanding of Technical Requirement


    • The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated to determine how well the offeror demonstrated a clear understanding of the requirements in the
      PWS and of the overall scope of the project.
    • The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the proposed system complies with all DoD/Federal Standards and Regulations
      as outlined in PWS Section 3.0.
    • The proposal will be evaluated based upon how their proposed solution meets or exceeds all the requirements outlined in Section 4.0, System
      Requirements:
    • A – General Requirements
    • B – Alerts Delivery Requirements – Desktop Notifications
    • C – Alerts Delivery Requirements – Phone Notifications
    • D – DCMA-Wide / Regional Management Requirements
    • E – Operator Access Policy Requirements
    • F – Alert Activation Requirements
    • G – Alert Management Requirements
    • H – User and Groups Management Requirements
    • I – User Data Integration and Updates Requirements
    • J – Communication Requirements
    • K – Security Requirements
    • L – Weather Alerts Requirements
    • The offerors proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the proposed solution meets the General Specifications of the PWS as  outlined
      in Section 8.0 as follows:
    • Licensing
    • Deliverables
    • Technology Refresh
    • IPV6 Compliance
    • Invoicing
    • Section 508 Compliance



   Factor 2 - Past Performance
   Offeror’s past performance will be evaluated to determine how well the offeror demonstrated compliance with prior contract requirements for
   work similar in nature to the work described in the Technical Specification.  A neutral rating may be applied for any contractor not having
   data available.  Past performance information will be evaluated based upon a comparative assessment among offerors.
   Factor 3 – Price


   The total offered price will be determined by adding the price for the basic requirements to the price for all options.  An offer is
   considered unbalanced when despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or
   understated.  An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk the
   Government.


   Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).


   Offerors price proposal must include the attached spreadsheet (Attachment 2) containing proposed prices.


    Evaluation of price will be accomplished separately from the technical evaluation.

declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,

(2) ( ___   ) Have, ( ___   ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered
against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state
or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or
commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating

amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment
was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(ii) Examples.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of
a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this
will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full
compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

of effort, which goes beyond the scope of the specifications/statement of work in the contract.


      c.  When, in the opinion of the Contractor, the COR requests effort outside the existing scope of the contract, the Contractor shall

252.209-9000   Organizational Conflicts of Interest

      a.  Purpose.  The primary purpose of this clause is to aid in ensuring that: (1) the Contractor's objectivity and judgment are not biased
because of its past, present, or currently planned interests (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise) which relate to work under
this contract; (2) the Contractor does not obtain an unfair competitive advantage by virtue of its access to non-public information regarding
the Government's program plans and actual or anticipated resources; and (3) by virtue of its access to proprietary information belonging to
others, the Contractor does not obtain any unfair competitive advantage.

      b.  Scope.  The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the Contractor and any of its affiliates or
their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as prime
contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity.

            (1)  Maintenance of Objectivity:  The Contractor shall be ineligible to participate in any capacity in contracts, subcontracts, or
proposals therefore (solicited or unsolicited) which stem directly from the Contractor's performance of work under this contract.  Furthermore,
unless so directed in writing by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not perform any services under this contract on any of its own
products or services, or the products or services of another firm if the Contractor is, or has been, substantially involved in their development
or marketing.  In addition, if the Contractor under this contract prepares a complete, or essentially complete, Statement of Work to be used in
competitive acquisitions, the contractor shall be ineligible to perform or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort which is based
on such Statement of Work or specifications.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall preclude the contractor from competing for follow-on contracts
involving the same or similar services.

            (2)  Access To and Use of Government Information:  If the Contractor, in the performance of this contract, obtains access to
Government information such as plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, or data which has not been released or otherwise made
available to the public, the contractor agrees that without prior written approval of the Contracting Officer, it shall not: (a) use such
information for any private purpose unless the information has been released or otherwise made available to the public; (b) compete for work
based on such information .until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public;  (c) submit an unsolicited proposal to
the Government which is based on such information until such information is released or otherwise made available to the public; and (d) release
such information unless such information has previously been released or otherwise made available to the public by the Government.

            (3)  Access To and Protection of Proprietary Information:  The Contractor agrees that, to the extent it receives or is given access
to proprietary data, trade secrets, other contractors’ proprietary information, or other confidential or privileged technical, business, or
financial information (hereinafter referred to as "proprietary data") under this contract, it shall not use or disclose such information for any
purpose other than providing the contract support services, and will not use or disclose the information for any personal or other commercial
purpose.  The Contractor further agrees to enter into a written agreement with any other company whose proprietary information they will have
access to, as required by FAR 9.505-4(b), for the protection of the proprietary data  and to exercise diligent effort to protect such
proprietary data from unauthorized use or disclosure.  A copy of each such written agreement shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer.  In
addition, the Contractor shall obtain from each employee who has access to proprietary data under this contract, a written agreement which shall
in substance provide that such employee shall not, during his/her employment by the Contractor or thereafter, disclose to others or use for
their benefit, proprietary data received in connection with the work under this Contract.

      c.  Subcontracts:  The Contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph, in consulting agreements and subcontracts of any
tier when directed by the Contracting Officer.  The terms "contract," "Contractor," and "Contracting Officer" will be appropriately modified to
preserve the Government's rights.

      d.  Representations and Disclosures:

            (1)  The Contractor represents that it has disclosed to the Contracting Officer, prior to award, all facts relevant to the existence
or potential existence of organizational conflict of interests as that term is used in FAR Subpart 9.5.

            (2)  The Contractor agrees that if after award it discovers an organizational conflict of interest with respect to this contract,
prompt and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer which shall include a description of the action the Contractor
has taken or proposes to take to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.

      e.  Remedies and Waiver:

            (1)  For breach of any of the above restrictions or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant facts required to be
disclosed during this contract, the Government may terminate this contract for default, disqualify the Contractor for subsequent related
contractual efforts, and pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.  If, however, in compliance with this clause,
the Contractor discovers and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest (or potential therefore) subsequent to contract award, the
Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience if such termination is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.

            (2)  The parties recognize that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which this clause might be applied in the future
and that the clause has effect which will survive the performance of this contract.  Accordingly, the Contractor may at any time seek a waiver
from the Contracting Officer by submitting a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.  If it is
determined to be in the best interests of the Government, the Head of Contracting Activity will grant such a waiver in writing.

      f.  Modifications:  Prior to a contract modification, when the Statement of Work is changed to add new work or the period of performance
is significantly increased, the Contracting Officer will request, and the Contractor is required to submit, either an organizational conflict of
interest disclosure or an update of the previously submitted disclosure or representation.

Instructions to Offerors - Proposal Submission

This will be a best value award decision.  Evaluation of the proposals will be based upon the following evaluation factors:

    o Factor 1 – Technical
    o Factor 2 – Past Performance
    o Factor 3 – Price

The non-price factors are of equal importance to each other and when combined are of equal importance to price.

PART II – Technical

Offerors must provide written technical information that demonstrates their qualifications to meet all requirements of the Technical
Specifications/PWS (Attachment 1).  This technical information must include the following:

Factor 1 - Technical

Understanding of Technical Requirement

    • The offeror must demonstrate in their proposal a clear understanding of all the requirements specified in the PWS and of the overall scope
      of the project.
    • The offeror must provide details as to how the proposed system complies with DoD/Federal Standards and Regulations as outlined in PWS
      Section 3.0.
    • The Offeror’s proposal must address each of  the performance requirements and identify how their proposed solution meets or exceeds all the
      requirements outlined in Section 4.0, System Requirements:
    • A – General Requirements
    • B – Alerts Delivery Requirements – Desktop Notifications
    • C – Alerts Delivery Requirements – Phone Notifications
    • D – DCMA-Wide / Regional Management Requirements
    • E – Operator Access Policy Requirements
    • F – Alert Activation Requirements
    • G – Alert Management Requirements
    • H – User and Groups Management Requirements
    • I – User Data Integration and Updates Requirements
    • J – Communication Requirements

      all the requirements listed in Section 8.0as follows:
    • Licensing
    • Deliverables
    • Technology Refresh
    • IPV6 Compliance
    • Invoicing
    • Section 508 Compliance

PART III – Past Performance

Factor 2 – Past Performance

Past performance is an indicator of a contractor’s ability to perform satisfactorily on future awards and is a record of contractor’s
conformance to specifications, quality conformance, adherence to contract schedules, and commitment to customer satisfaction.

Offerors must provide information concerning performance in providing supplies and services relevant to those required in the PWS, for the last
three contracts similar in nature to this requirement, either completed or currently being performed during the last three years.  Offerors
shall describe the relevance of each listed contract to the current RFP’s requirements.  Contracts listed may include those entered into by the
Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers.  Offerors must provide point of contact information for
each contract identified.

The Government will utilize the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov to evaluate contractor past performance
for those contractors having previously performed on a Federal Government contract (s). PPIRS is a web-enabled, government-wide application that
collects quantifiable and narrative contractor past performance information from all Federal contracting agencies and provides a contractor’s
previous performance based on Federal Stock Class (FSC) or Product Service Code (PSC).


PART IV – Price Quote

Factor 3 - Pricing

Provide pricing using the attached pricing spreadsheet (Attachment 2) which includes the basic description of required line items as outlined in
the RFP.  It is up to the offeror to carefully review the PWS and quote all line items that will be necessary for the offeror to successfully
perform the contract.

Evaluation and Award


Proposals submitted in response to this RFP will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth below. It is imperative that
offerors respond directly to each area specified and ensure their proposal is submitted on the most favorable terms, since less than their best
potential could result in exclusion of the proposal from further consideration. Responses which merely repeat the PWS cannot be considered as
being responsive to the requirements of the RFP.  Assurances of experience, capability or qualifications, without a clear demonstration to
support the claim, may adversely influence the evaluation of the proposal.

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.  Proposals should contain the vendor’s best terms regarding non-
price and price factors.  Additionally, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revisions to proposals if it is
determined to be necessary.  If a negotiation range is established, the Government may limit the number of proposals in the negotiation range to
the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal complies with the RFP, meets the PWS requirements, represents the best value to the Government
considering technical qualifications, past performance, and price.  Non-price factors, technical and past performance are of equal importance to
each other, and when combined are of equal importance to price.  However if two or more offers are tied with respect to their overall (non-
price) ratings, then price will be the deciding factor.

Evaluation Criteria

Part I – Administrative Data

Proposals that fail to furnish the required information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from
consideration.


PART II Technical Qualifications

Factor 1 – Technical

Offerors technical qualifications will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the offeror has demonstrated its capability to perform the
PWS requirements to include:

   Understanding of Technical Requirement


    • The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated to determine how well the offeror demonstrated a clear understanding of the requirements in the
      PWS and of the overall scope of the project.
    • The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the proposed system complies with all DoD/Federal Standards and Regulations
      as outlined in PWS Section 3.0.
    • The proposal will be evaluated based upon how their proposed solution meets or exceeds all the requirements outlined in Section 4.0, System
      Requirements:
    • A – General Requirements
    • B – Alerts Delivery Requirements – Desktop Notifications
    • C – Alerts Delivery Requirements – Phone Notifications
    • D – DCMA-Wide / Regional Management Requirements
    • E – Operator Access Policy Requirements
    • F – Alert Activation Requirements
    • G – Alert Management Requirements
    • H – User and Groups Management Requirements
    • I – User Data Integration and Updates Requirements
    • J – Communication Requirements
    • K – Security Requirements
    • L – Weather Alerts Requirements
    • The offerors proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the proposed solution meets the General Specifications of the PWS as  outlined
      in Section 8.0 as follows:
    • Licensing
    • Deliverables
    • Technology Refresh
    • IPV6 Compliance
    • Invoicing
    • Section 508 Compliance



   Factor 2 - Past Performance
   Offeror’s past performance will be evaluated to determine how well the offeror demonstrated compliance with prior contract requirements for
   work similar in nature to the work described in the Technical Specification.  A neutral rating may be applied for any contractor not having
   data available.  Past performance information will be evaluated based upon a comparative assessment among offerors.
   Factor 3 – Price


   The total offered price will be determined by adding the price for the basic requirements to the price for all options.  An offer is
   considered unbalanced when despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or
   understated.  An offer may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk the
   Government.


   Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).


   Offerors price proposal must include the attached spreadsheet (Attachment 2) containing proposed prices.


    Evaluation of price will be accomplished separately from the technical evaluation.
