2.  Task Order Title.  DeCA TAS

The TAS PWS will enable DeCA to acquire a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) TAS that provides DeCA an automated timekeeping and schedule exception
tracking capability.  This will allow DeCA to achieve efficiencies in time entry and improvement in operations through more timely and accurate
data collection and reporting.  This solution will support approximately 16,000 DeCA employees worldwide that are paid via the Defense Civilian
Pay System (DCPS), a Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) system that processes payroll.  DeCA requires enterprise licensed software
hosted by DeCA and has determined that software as a service (SaaS) hosted by a time and attendance service provider is not acceptable, as the
TAS software must be in compliance with the DIACAP DoD Instruction 8510.01 and 8500.2 security controls.  Additionally, the TAS software shall
run on a government owned server.

3.  Background.  DeCA’s mission is to deliver a premier quality-of-life benefit to the Armed Services community by satisfying customer demand
for high-quality grocery and household products and providing exceptional savings.  One of DeCA’s strategic goals is to provide the military
community with a great shopping experience by providing the best possible service at the lowest price.

DeCA currently operates 24x7 commissaries, twelve central distribution centers (CDCs), area offices, headquarters, and off-site locations (e.g.,
employees conducting sales at National Guard and Reserve sites for a limited number of days) worldwide.  Of that total, 182 stores are located
within the United States including Alaska and Hawaii, and 77 stores are located in 13 countries and two territories outside of the United
States.

Sixty percent of DeCA employees paid via DCPS have either intermittent or part-time work schedules, which results in frequent schedule changes
and related exception data.  Currently, DeCA uses a manual process to record time and attendance (T&A) data and to support payroll actions for
approximately 16,000 employees worldwide at stores, CDCs, area offices, and headquarters.  The paper-based processes are inefficient and create
a significant amount of errors and rework to correct employee pay and also result in negative audit findings.  The current process and the
future process are described in the reference materials available at https://www.commissaries.com/tas/.

DeCA employees’ participation in the timekeeping process differs by the level of the organization in which they work.  TAS must support the
entry of timekeeping data at each of the following organizational levels:
 • Above store level. Headquarters, area offices, and other managerial employees typically work a 40-hour week with few schedule changes.  These
   employees have easy access to personal computers (PCs) in their work areas.

 • Store level.  These employee schedules may change frequently to meet operational needs.  Only a few PCs exist in the store environment with
   limited or no access for the majority of store employees (10 – 200).  An automated method to capture sign-in, sign-out, and other payroll
   information is required to prevent a lengthy queue and delay at the start of the work day.  Other payroll information required is described in
   the Automated Exception Request Forms document, located in the reference materials at https://www.commissaries.com/tas/.


At all organizational levels, TAS shall be in compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), which is also located at
https://www.commissaries.com/tas/.  Based on HSPD-12, DeCA requires two system access methods using two-factor authentication.  First, the
employee may enter their T&A data using a government-issued computer that accepts a DoD issued common access card (CAC) with related personal
identification number (PIN).  Second, the employee may enter their T&A data using a contractor provided T&A terminal that includes a CAC reader
capable of reading the employee CAC chip and accepting the employee PIN.


DeCA TAS user roles include the following:


 • Employee.  Employees submit their own T&A data, request exceptions (e.g., annual leave, sick time, overtime), certify their own timecards, and
   have access to their own reports and timekeeping data.


 • Timekeeper. Timekeepers have access to timekeeping records for all employees within their assigned facility or organizational structure.
   Timekeepers can approve timekeeping transactions and have the authority to create employee and organizational reports using their facility or
   organizational structure’s timekeeping records.


 • Supervisor.  Supervisors have access to timekeeping records for all employees under their supervision and within their assigned facility or
   organizational structure.  They will manage work schedules, approve timekeeping transactions, certify timekeeping entries for their assigned
   employees, and create reports using timekeeping records for their assigned employees.


 • Customer service representative (CSR). CSRs have access to timekeeping records for all employees within their assigned facility or
   organizational structure.  CSRs oversee TAS operations, identify error conditions, process corrections, and interact with DCPS.  CSRs have the
   authority to create employee and organizational reports.


 • System administrator.  System Administrators have unlimited access to timekeeping records for the purposes of system administration, help desk
   functions, and general support to users.


4.  Objectives:  The contractor shall provide a COTS TAS with any needed modifications to meet DeCA requirements including the enterprise
software, remote input devices with CAC interface (aka timekeeping units), software installation, hardware deployment and installation,
training, and hardware and software maintenance.

The contractor shall provide the ability to capture T&A information, validate and correct data, and complete certifications per DCPS
requirements in a manner that enables DeCA to realize its expected business outcomes.  The system shall support DeCA employees worldwide who are
paid via DCPS.  TAS shall provide a solution that enables employees at all levels to interact with TAS for time capture, reporting payroll
exceptions, and submitting T&A data with or without access to a PC.  The system will have a bi-directional interface with DCPS and one-
directional interfaces with two DeCA systems – the DeCA Electronic Records Management and Archive System (DERMAS) and the Enterprise Data
Warehouse (EDW).

                       DeCA’s objectives of TAS, through both functional and technical improvements, are as follows:


                  • Increase operational effectiveness.
      o Standardize T&A processes for the various organizational levels.
      o Streamline processes that track sign-in and sign-out times for employees.
      o Establish an audit trail for updates and certification of T&A data.
      o Reduce administrative tasks for timekeepers, supervisors, and CSRs.
      o Reduce costs associated with printing and storing paper-based records and reports.
      o Reduce payroll processing errors.

                  • Improve decision making.
      o Provide data and reports to facilitate more timely decisions (e.g., how many employees received Sunday premium pay during a fiscal year,
        or how many times was overtime used at a particular store).
      o Enhance reporting capability.
      o Provide information for making scheduling decisions (automated scheduling will not be a part of this effort).

                  • Increase employee satisfaction.
      o Increase privacy and security related to employee timesheets and related timekeeping data.
      o Increase payroll accuracy.
      o Reduce time spent storing, tracking, and searching for paper timesheets or leave request forms.
      o Increase the sense of fairness that timekeeping practices are applied consistently through business rules.

   DeCA has identified several business outcomes in terms of specific program timelines, thresholds, and objectives to be achieved within the
   defined scope.  It presents the anticipated benefits in terms of measurable and time-bound program objectives through operational metrics. The
   contractor shall support DeCA’s achievement of these measures through implementation of TAS.

5.  Scope.  The scope of the DeCA TAS program is to acquire a COTS TAS that allows all DeCA employees to enter their payroll information
electronically and securely using modern IT equipment.  TAS scope includes the sending and receiving of T&A and other information to DeCA and
DoD systems, training users and support personnel, and maintaining the associated hardware and software products at all DeCA locations
worldwide.

6.  Performance Requirements.  The contractor shall provide an innovative solution in support of DeCA’s achievement through implementation of
TAS.  The contractors shall describe how they will support, manage, and complete each of the tasks; how they will provide the required
deliverable products; and how they will achieve the stated requirements as follows:

A. Capture Time & Attendance Data:

   TAS shall enable all employees paid through DCPS to enter their T&A daily using either a government-issued computer or a timekeeping unit,
   both with two-factor CAC authentication.  This includes the ability to request, review, approve, and disapprove exception requests through the
   system and will automate the current manual timesheets and forms used by DeCA.  To support capture of daily data, TAS must interface with DCPS
   to obtain information on new employees and changes in employee status (e.g., full-time worker, part-time work, or intermittent work) or work
   schedules.

B. Validate and Correct T&A Data:

   TAS shall use business rules and validation checks compliant with the Department of Defense (DoD) Financial Management Regulation (FMR) to
   identify erroneous T&A entries.  TAS shall enable employees, timekeepers, supervisors, and CSRs to make corrections in TAS during the pay
   period as required and for CSRs to make changes to T&A data for up to one year after hours were worked.

C. Perform Pay Period Processes:

   TAS shall require employees to certify their timesheets using electronic signatures.  After an employee has certified their timesheet, TAS
   shall allow the respective supervisor to approve and certify the timesheet data for inclusion in the Source Data Automation (SDA) file that is
   transmitted to DCPS.

D. Interface with Government Systems:

   TAS must interface with three systems.  First, TAS will interface with DCPS and transmit SDA files several times each pay period in accordance
   with DCPS SDA transmission schedules.  TAS shall create the SDA file and check for errors prior to submission to DCPS.  TAS shall also receive
   master employee record (MER) data from DCPS to establish and maintain employee data.  Specifications for the file interfaces with DCPS are
   located at https://www.commissaries.com/tas/.  Second, TAS will forward portable document file (PDF) formats of each employee’s timesheet to

|        |system shall enable access to those web servers by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connections using secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol|
|        |Security (HTTPS).  HTTP is not authorized for access to web servers hosting this information.  In addition, these web servers    |
|        |must support DoD requirements for authenticating users using DoD PKI certificates.                                               |
|        |The system shall be compliant with all DoD requirements to protect personally identifiable information (PII).  Compliance        |
|        |includes encryption of data at rest for all mobile computing devices or removable storage media.                                 |
|        |The system shall be in compliance with the information assurance vulnerability management (IAVM) program and with information    |
|        |assurance vulnerability alerts (IAVAs) within the required time frame.                                                           |
|        |The system shall support requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 United States Code (U.S.C.) 794d)),   |
|        |which requires Federal agencies acquiring electronic and information technology to ensure that Federal employees with            |
|        |disabilities have access to and use of information and data that are comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who   |
|        |are not individuals with disabilities. The requirements of Section 508 compliance are not applicable to the time clock           |
|        |(hardware); the requirements of Section 508 are applicable to the TAS software.                                                  |

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours
As prescribed in 4.804 (S-90), insert the following clause:

                                           CONTRACT/ORDER CLOSEOUT—FIXED-PRICE, TIME-AND-MATERIALS, OR
                                                              LABOR-HOURS (JAN 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order. The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order. A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification. A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order. If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an
invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period
of performance to allow for deobligation of excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

                                                                 (End of clause)




52.209-9000  ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (OCCI)  (DEC 2005)

(a)  An offeror shall identify in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, any potential or actual Organizational and Consultant
Conflicts of Interest (OCCI) as described in FAR Subpart 9.5.  This includes actual or potential conflicts of interests of proposed
subcontractors.  If an offeror identifies in its proposal, quote, bid or any resulting contract, a potential or actual conflict of interests the
offeror shall submit an Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest Plan (OCCIP) to the contracting officer.  The OCCIP shall describe
how the offeror addresses potential or actual conflicts of interest and identify how they will avoid, neutralize, or mitigate present or future
conflicts of interest.

(b)  Offerors must consider whether their involvement and participation raises any OCCI issues, especially in the following areas when:

     (1)  Providing systems engineering and technical direction.

     (2)  Preparing specifications or work statements and/or objectives.

     (3)  Providing evaluation services.

     (4)  Obtaining access to proprietary information.

(c)  If a prime contractor or subcontractor breaches any of the OCCI restrictions, or does not disclose or misrepresents any relevant facts
concerning its conflict of interest, the government may take appropriate action, including terminating the contract, in additional to any
remedies that may be otherwise permitted by the contract or operation of law.

                                                                 (End of clause)




52.217-8     OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)

The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.  These rates may
be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.  The option provision may be exercised
more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months.  The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by
written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of contract expiration.

(End of clause)



52.217-9     OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)

(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of contract expiration; provided that
the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days. The preliminary notice does not
commit the Government to an extension.

(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.

(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 60 months.
(End of clause)



52.237-9001  Enterprise-wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (eCMRA) Reporting.
As prescribed in 37.102-90, use the following clause:
ENTERPRISE-WIDE Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (eCMRA) Reporting   (NOV 2013)

The contractor shall ensure ALL contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for the performance of services provided
under this contract are reported via a secure data collection site.

The contractor (and all subcontractors providing direct labor under this contract) shall report complete and accurate data for the labor
executed during the period of performance during each Government fiscal year (FY), which runs from October 1 to September 30.  The Contractor
shall input the data into the appropriate eCMRA reporting tool, which can be accessed via a secure web site at http://www.ecmra.mil/.  There are
four separate eCMRA tools: Army, Air Force, Navy and All Other Defense Components.  The appropriate eCMRA reporting tool to use is determined by
the requiring activity being supported (e.g., if DISA awards a contract for an Air Force requiring activity, the contractor shall load the
required reporting data in the “Department of Air Force CMRA” tool).  While inputs may be reported any time during the FY, all data shall be
reported no later than October 31 of each calendar year.  The contractor shall completely fill in all required data fields.  The contractor
shall enter initial data into the appropriate eCMRA tool to establish the basic contract record no later than 15 working days after receipt of
contract award or contract modification incorporating this clause.  The contractor shall notify the COR when the basic contract record has been
established in the appropriate eCMRA tool.

eCMRA User Manuals and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) are available at http://www.ecmra.mil/

Contractors may direct technical questions to the eCMRA help desk at
dodcmra@pentagon.af.mil
.

                                                                 (End of clause)

|All contractor personnel with access to government computer systems will meet the requirements of DoD 5200.2R as implemented by DeCA.  Each support position that  |
|the contractor staffs will be classified as to its sensitivity.  Personnel must receive a favorable investigation commensurate with their level of access based on |
|position sensitivity.  A copy of DoD 5200.2R can be found on the DoD website at www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pub1.html.  Access to classified information is |
|not required.  Examples of positions requiring access and appropriate IT level are:                                                                                |

1.  Contract or Task Order Title:  DeCA Time and Attendance System (TAS)

2.  Work Requirements:


    • Task 1 – Program Management
    • Task 2 – Software and Hardware Configuration
    • Task 3 - Testing
    • Task 4 – Training
    • Task 5 – Deployment
    • Task 6 – Operations and Sustainment

3.  Primary Method of Surveillance:

    • Task 1 – Program Management

    ✓ Periodic Inspection: These services are monitored weekly and/or monthly during ongoing status meetings and progress reporting.  Program
      Management deliverables occur on a predetermined, specified time frame.  As TAS tasks are performed these periodic inspections will become
      100 percent evaluations when each task is accepted by the government.   Inspections for one-time Program Management deliverables will be
      100 percent inspection by headquarters.


    • Task 2 – Software and Hardware Configuration

    ✓ 100 Percent Inspection.  This task requires full government inspection that the hardware and software adhere to TAS functional and
      technical requirements.  With this method, performance is inspected/evaluated at each determined milestone within the software and hardware
      configuration task.  Final acceptance of the TAS hardware and software configuration will occur with the Critical Design Review approval.


    • Task 3 – Testing

    ✓ 100 Percent Inspection.  Because this task is critical to the success of the TAS effort, this task requires 100 percent inspection and
      evaluation of the task products and outcome.  Inspection will occur initially with review and acceptance of the test approach and plan.
      The government will have both functional and technical subject matter experts participating in the testing activities and reviewing testing
      results.  Testing results will be inspected and evaluated at each occurrence.
    ✓ 100 Percent Inspection.  Acceptance of Lab Test results.
    ✓ 100 Percent Inspection. Acceptance of Pilot Test results.
    ✓ 100 Percent Inspection.  Verify payroll data is 99.99% successfully transferred to TAS using error reports generated by DoD interface
      recipients.


    • Task 4 – Training

    ✓ 100 Percent Inspection.  This task requires full government inspection and acceptance of written and computer-based training materials
      and training plan.
    ✓ Periodic Inspection: Actual training events will be monitored by government appointed personnel periodically, based on the predetermined,
      specified location and time frame within which the training must be accomplished.
    ✓ Trainee Input.  Trainees will be requested to complete a survey following each training event, allowing survey results to indicate
      unsatisfactory or inadequate training services and suggestions for improvements.  Trainee self-reported ability regarding training
      objectives as indicated by the survey results will provide the acceptable performance standard.

    • Task 5 – Deployment

    ✓ 100 Percent Inspection.  Approval of the Technical Implementation Plan.
    ✓ 100 Percent Inspection and Acceptance.  This task requires full government acceptance of the deployed hardware and software at each
      deployment location.

    • Task 6 – Operations and Sustainment – depending on the type of task being performed or the type of deliverable being submitted, one of the
      following acceptable surveillance methods will be used:

    ✓ 100 Percent Inspection.  This method will be used for tasks with performance requirements, such as hardware or software upgrade support.
    ✓ Random Sampling.  This method will be used for recurring tasks, such as incident analysis reports, to verify that the level of
      performance is acceptable.
    ✓ Periodic Inspection: This method will be used to monitor services when the time or frequency cannot be predicted or when there is known
      deliverable timeframes, such as the status reports or the monthly report of other direct charges.
    ✓ Customer Input.  This method will be used on an ongoing basis to determine and verify that the services provided are acceptable and meet
      performance expectations.

4.  Scope of Performance:

The scope of the DeCA TAS program is to acquire a COTS TAS that allows all DeCA employees to enter their payroll information electronically and
securely using modern IT equipment.  TAS scope includes the sending and receiving of T&A and other information to DeCA and DoD systems, training
users and support personnel, and maintaining the associated hardware and software products at all DeCA locations worldwide.

5.  Performance Standards:

The goal of implementing an automated Time and Attendance System is to improve overall efficiencies in underlying business processes.  An
automated TAS will enable employees and supervisors to reduce errors and corrections and provide improved insight into record keeping and enable
supervisors to improve workforce planning.  Cost reduction is expected due to the decreased need for paper and storage to support manual
systems.   The following metrics are proposed to measure TAS system performance.

5.0 Volume III - Cost/Price



5.1 General Instructions


5.1.1 Cost/Price Reasonableness and Completeness

This section is to assist you in submitting cost or pricing data that is required to evaluate the reasonableness, and completeness of your
proposed cost/price.  Compliance with these requirements is mandatory and failure to comply may result in rejection of your proposal and removal
of the proposal from further consideration.  Note that unrealistically low or high proposed costs or prices, initially or subsequently, may be
grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has submitted an
unrealistic proposal.  Additionally, unbalanced pricing poses an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror’s
proposal.  Cost submissions should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate their reasonableness and be adequate enough to support and sustain a
DCAA audit.

5.1.2 Estimating Techniques and Methods

Not used as this is a FFP contract.

5.1.3 Cost/Price Information

Information beyond that required by this instruction shall not be submitted, unless you consider it essential to document or support your
cost/price position.  All information relating to the proposed price, including all required supporting documentation must be included in the
section of the proposal designated as the Cost/Price volume.  Under no circumstances shall this information and documentation be included
elsewhere in the proposal.

5.1.4 Cost or Pricing Information Requirements

In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing data may be required to support price
reasonableness/realism.  Information shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5.
5.1.5  Pricing Proposal
The offeror shall provide their price proposal on the Price Template (attached as object at the end of this paragraph).  The price proposal
shall reflect rates for the base period and all option periods, including option pricing for an additional six-month period that may be
authorized IAW FAR 52.217-8. See FAR 52.217-8 which authorizes the government to require continued performance of any services within the limits
and at the rates specified in the contract. The price proposal spreadsheet includes a separate line item for the additional six-month period IAW
FAR 52.217-8. These prices shall be identical to the quoted pricing in the six months prior to expiration of the final option period.  The total
evaluated price will consist of the contractor’s proposed price for the base period and all option periods.  The labor rates in this section
shall reflect the fully-burdened rates for each labor category and will apply to all direct labor hours.  Instructions for the price template
are as follows

“Summary” Tab:  Input total pricing for each CLIN and period of performance, as appropriate.

“Labor Rates” Tabs:  Input the labor categories, number of hours, and labor rate for each CLIN.

reimbursed as an ODC.

5.1.6  Payment Plan
The Offeror shall propose a fixed price payment plan commensurate with the value of the deliverables and/or significant milestones in the PWS
for this requirement.  A firm fixed price payment plan with the total dollar amount divided into equal monthly payments will not be accepted
unless the offeror provides justification for this plan that the Government subsequently deems adequate.  The eventual awardee will be
authorized to invoice monthly for all approved travel costs incurred and approved by the COR.

5.2 Volume Organization

The Cost/Price volume shall consist of the following sections:
      SECTION 1 - Table of Contents
      SECTION 2 - Cost or pricing information, Labor Rate Table and supporting data, to include estimating methodology.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT


52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


a. Basis for Contract Award

This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented
by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the DISA Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DARS).  These regulations are
available electronically at http://www.ditco.disa.mil/hq/aqinfo.asp and http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  The Government will select the best overall
offer, based upon an integrated assessment of technical/management and cost/price.  The contract may be awarded to the offeror who is deemed
responsible in accordance FAR 9.104, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation’s requirements (to include all stated terms,
conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by the instructions of this solicitation) and is judged, based
on the evaluation factors and subfactors, to represent the best value to the Government.  Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the
solicitation may result in the offeror being ineligible for award.  The SSA will base the source selection decision on an integrated assessment
of proposals against all source selection criteria in the solicitation (described below).

b. Evaluation Factors and Subfactors

   1) The following evaluation factors and subfactors will be used to evaluate each proposal.  Past performance is not an evaluation factor, but
      may be utilized in determining contractor responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.104.  Award will be made to the offeror proposing the
      combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and subfactors described
      below:



      Factor 1: Technical/Management
            Subfactor 1: Technical PWS Task 6.5.1
            Subfactor 2: Technical PWS Task 6.2.1.1
            Subfactor 3: Program Management PWS Task 6.1
      Factor 2: Cost/Price


   2) Relative Importance of Factors and Subfactors.  The relative importance of each factor and subfactor is as follows:  Within the
      Technical/Management factor, the subfactors are of equal importance.  In accordance with FAR 15.304(e), the Technical/Management factor is
      significantly more important than Cost/Price.

c. Ratings

   1) Technical/Management Rating.  The technical/management rating provides an assessment of the offeror’s capability to satisfy the
      Government’s requirements.  Each technical/management subfactor will receive one of the color ratings described in the DoD Source Selection
      Procedures, paragraph 3.1.2.2.1.  The subfactor ratings will not be rolled up into an overall color rating for the Technical/Management
      factor.

|BLUE                   |Outstanding              |Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the |
|                       |                         |requirements.  The proposal contains multiple strengths and no deficiencies.               |
|PURPLE                 |Good                     |Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the     |
|                       |                         |requirements.  Proposal contains at least one strength and no deficiencies.                |
|GREEN                  |Acceptable               |Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the    |
|                       |                         |requirements.  Proposal has no strengths or deficiencies.                                  |

|                       |                         |and understanding of the requirements.                                                     |
|RED                    |Unacceptable             |Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies and is           |
|                       |                         |unawardable.                                                                               |

      Following the review of the evaluation criteria identified in Table 1, the offerors’ proposals will be reviewed to determine if the
      offerors have sufficiently addressed all paragraphs within the PWS in order for their proposal to be responsive to the solicitation.  This
      review will only identify whether the offeror’s proposal “Meets”, “Does Not Meet, has a “Deficiency” or “Uncertainty” in their approach to
      addressing all paragraphs of the PWS.

   2) Technical/Management Risk Rating.  The Technical/Management Risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses or significant weaknesses associated
      with an offeror's proposed approach and includes an assessment of the potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation
      of performance, the need for increased Government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance.




      The Technical/Management subfactors will receive one of the risk ratings described in the DoD Source Selection Procedures, paragraph
      3.1.2.2.2, Table 3 – Technical Risk Ratings, excerpted below.  They focus on the risks, i.e., weaknesses and significant weaknesses, of the
      offeror’s proposed approach to each of the technical/management subfactors.  For any weakness identified, the evaluation shall address the
      offeror's proposed mitigation and why that mitigation approach is or is not manageable.

Table 2. Technical Risk Ratings
|Table 2. Technical Risk Ratings                                                                                                           |
|Rating                     |Description                                                                                                  |
|Low                        |Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.  Normal  |
|                           |contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome any difficulties.         |
|Moderate                   |Can potentially cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.  Special         |
|                           |contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will likely be able to overcome difficulties.            |
|High                       |Is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance.  Is     |
|                           |unlikely to overcome any difficulties, even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.|

   3) Cost/Price.  Each offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated but not rated.  The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated to determine
      completeness and reasonableness as defined below:




      Completeness -  Proposals will be reviewed to determine the extent to which cost/price elements of the offer have been addressed.  The
      offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated to ensure continuity and traceability of prices to the technical proposal and between the
      initial proposal and any revisions thereto.  The review will determine the adequacy of the contractor’s proposal in addressing and
      fulfilling the solicitation requirements.




      Reasonableness – Proposals will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404 in order to determine if it is
      reasonable and realistic.  For a price to be reasonable, it must represent a price to the Government that a prudent person would pay in the
      conduct of competitive business.

d. Evaluation of Options

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the base period.  The
offeror shall submit pricing for the base period and all option periods, including option pricing for an additional six-month period that may be
authorized IAW FAR 52.217-8.  See FAR 52.217-8 which authorizes the government to require continued performance of any services within the
limits and at the rates specified in the contract.  The pricing proposal should include a separate line item for the additional six-month period
IAW FAR 52.217-8.  These prices shall be identical to the proposed pricing in the six months prior to expiration of the base period, or the
final option period, if option periods are present.  The total evaluated price will consist of the contractor’s proposed price for the base
period, all option periods, and the option pricing for the additional six-month period.  The Government may determine that an offer is
unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the
option(s).

e. Discussions

If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, offeror responses to
Evaluation Notices (ENs) and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision.

f. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers

The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, contract terms and conditions.
Additionally, the Government may reject proposals that are unrealistically high or low in cost when compared to Government estimates, such that
the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.
