SECTION C ­ DESCRIPTION/ SPECIFICATIONS/ WORK STATEMENT

Note: Attachment 19 provides a list of terms and acronyms, along with their corresponding definitions, used within this document.
C.1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND The National Driver Register (NDR) program of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), acts as a nationwide clearinghouse for driver licensing decision makers (i.e., State driver licensing authorities and Federal agencies that employ people as drivers). It is also a source of information for programs related to airline, railroad, highway, and maritime safety administered by Federal agencies. It may also be used by employers to inquire on employees who are being hired as motor vehicle operators or airline pilots. C.1.1 Legislative Background Established by Public Law 86-660 in 1960, the NDR began operating in July 1961. Basic provisions of the law remain in effect, but significant changes have been legislated since the NDR was founded. Access to the NDR is granted by statute (Title 49 U.S.C. Chapter 303). Public Law 97-364, known as the NDR Act of 1982, significantly affected the NDR. This legislation required a more effective and immediate means of obtaining information on problem drivers, which resulted in the development of the Problem Driver Pointer System (PDPS). Under PDPS, when a probable identification is made as a result of an inquiry on a driver license applicant, the NDR sends a request for the driver's status (i.e., licensed, eligible, not eligible, reported deceased) to the State of Record (SOR) on behalf of the State of Inquiry (SOI). The SOR then sends the driver's status data directly to the SOI. Four States pilot tested the PDPS process in 1987. The PDPS is derived from the results of the pilot test and the comments received during the rulemaking, which was finalized on August 20, 1991. It has been implemented nationwide. The most recent legislation affecting the NDR is the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. This law requires an NDR check before any motor vehicle operator's license is issued or renewed. C.1.2 PDPS General Description The PDPS is a centralized database of drivers whose privilege to drive has been suspended, revoked, cancelled or denied for cause. It is operated by NHTSA in cooperation with the 50 States and the District of Columbia (D.C.). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), United States Coast Guard (USCG), National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), certain employers, and individuals are also authorized to access NDR information. These entities are often referred to as "other authorized users of the PDPS". The PDPS serves as a central point of contact for the chief driver licensing official in a State to use to determine if a license applicant has been reported as a problem driver by any other State. Such information alerts States of potential problem drivers. This facilitates both the administration of driver improvement actions and driver license issuance. All States and DC participate in PDPS in conformance with the NDR Act of 1982. The PDPS uses its file of information regarding problem drivers at the PDPS host computer system to support a pointer system that coordinates the exchange of information between States of Inquiry, the NDR, and States of Record. When a State sends an inquiry, the PDPS responds to the inquiry by sending the match indication and the matching data back to the SOI and sends a Driver Status request to the SOR. The SOR transmits the response (the Driver Status) directly to the SOI.

14

DTNH22-12-R-00542 Timesharing Services for Problem Driver Pointer System
After the SOI receives the Status, it may decide to request a full Driver History Record or a printed Driver License Abstract from the SOR. The Driver History Request must be sent from the SOI to the SOR, the Driver License Abstract Request may be sent to the SOR through PDPS. PDPS involves much more than inquiry service. States can also submit records for addition, changes, and deletion. PDPS provides authorized users access to NDR information. States send updates (identification data regarding problem drivers, i.e., driver license number, full legal name, alias names, date of birth, height, weight, sex, eye color, and Social Security Number (if collected by the State)) and inquiries (identification data regarding persons who are applying for or renewing licenses) via the PDPS client. In addition, States may completely replace all of their data on the PDPS with a new set of data. This process is called a Clean File. This is a 2-day process performed by PDPS six to eight times a year (on Saturday and Sunday) which unloads the master files and indices, deletes old records, and reloads the files. A State may participate by sending their complete file of data in update format on the week prior to the Clean File weekend. States are encouraged to participate at least once a year. The file search involved in processing inquiries is a soundex-based name-search routine. This is needed, because there is no nationwide method to uniquely identify drivers. When the name search finds a record in the PDPS file that qualifies as a match, it returns a probable identification to the inquiring party. The user is then responsible for verifying that the applicant and the problem driver are the same person. A principal objective of the PDPS application is the rapid provision of timely and accurate data to support licensing approval and denial decisions by State driver licensing personnel at the licensing agency office. States are responsible for intra-state hardware, software and communications. The State application programs may be written in any language and may be running on a host system of any manufacture. States are also responsible for the development of software interfaces and procedures for communicating with PDPS via the AAMVAnet, Inc. network. Network connectivity support for State interaction with PDPS is provided through the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators' network (AAMVAnetTM). This network handles all network traffic between the State systems and the PDPS host system. The network is a virtual private network (VPN) procured by AAMVA through its current provider, Verizon Business. State FTP and SFTP traffic also traverses this network. All interactive messages are routed through AAMVA's Network Control Software (NCS). This application distributes traffic to its designated destination. This software facilitates communication between different hardware platforms and operating systems. C.1.3 PDPS Operations and Environment SOLICITATION NOTICE For a description of the operating environment in existence at time of RFP release, refer to:  Attachments 2-4 "PDPS Current Hardware Configurations"  Attachments 5-7 "PDPS Current Production and Development Hardware Environments and PDPS Current Production Software Environment"  Attachments 8 and 9, Section J ­ "PDPS Network Environment.

PDPS receives the inquiries from the various states via web service interface. The Web service has been developed using SOAP protocol and is deployed under the Web Logic application server. The Web service transfers the inquiries to the Database server. The messages are transmitted internally within the Database using Oracle Advance Queues and go through processing logic using Oracle PL/SQL code. The responses from the System are sent using a Java program by invoking the AAMVA Web service. There are two Database server nodes performing the inquiry transactions in a RAC environment. States and other authorized users send files via SFTP/FTP to the PDPS application. These files are stored under the Oracle ASM managed Cluster File System (ACFS) on the Database Servers. This allows the files to be seen by both the Database Servers. PDPS handles Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data. This is encrypted at the table space level using Oracle's Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) solution. C.1.3.1 Data Center Facilities and Infrastructure The PDPS Servers are housed in a secure Data Center. The Servers are behind a firewall and access is controlled via specific firewall rules. The Data Center has backup generator power and UPS facilities. The Disaster Recovery (DR) facility is located in a different geographical location and the Database is replicated to the DR site using standard Dataguard replication. C.1.3.2 PDPS Physical Servers (Refer to Attachments 2-4) The PDPS application utilizes four dedicated Servers. Two servers serve as application servers and the other two serve as database servers. The Development environment has a similar architecture as well. There is also a Windows Development server used for source version control, code development etc. C.1.3.3 PDPS Hardware / Software (Refer to Attachments 5-7). The load balancer receives transactions from PDPS users and ensures that the requests are evenly distributed across the PDPS application servers. Likewise, state FTP/SFTP requests go through the load balancer as well. The PDPS system processes messages from the states, sends out the responses and generates the reports for the NDR users. The states send interactive messages through the AAMVA network. AAMVA invokes the web services on the Application Servers to send interactive messages to PDPS. The web services are deployed on the Web Logic Application Server. The load balancer distributes the AAMVA messages between the two application servers. Each of the application servers sends the message to its primary database. Application Server 1 has Production DB Server 1 as the primary database and Application Server 2 has the Production DB Server 2 as the primary database. In case the primary database is not available, they send the message to the secondary database, which is Production DB Server 2 for Application Server 1 and Production Server DB 1 for Application Server 2. The Production Database Server 1 and Production Database Server 2 share the database files on shared SAN disks in an Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC) environment. Batch messages are received from and sent to States and other authorized users via FTP or SFTP. The majority of the messages (interactive and batch) are driver inquiry messages. The PDPS system processes messages in real time interactive mode or in nightly batch jobs. The nightly batch jobs generate PDF reports. This system also has weekly batch jobs for maintenance activities. The GUI implemented using the Oracle Application Express allows the NDR staff to access various reports and manage driver pointers in the database. The PDPS Application Support Team uses the Windows and UNIX servers to connect to the database and application servers for daily maintenance activities. The Windows server also has supporting software such as CVS,

47

DTNH22-12-R-00542 Timesharing Services for Problem Driver Pointer System
1. Administration of passwords and project identifiers shall be the responsibility of the subscribers and/or users. 2. The NHTSA CO or owners of programs and data files, as appropriate, must be able to define the data files and programs that may be accessed by each valid user or class of users. At their option, Government subscribers may restrict Government-owned data files (including programs) to their own use, or the NHTSA CO may negotiate a contract modification whereby the contractor's commercial customers may use Government-owned data files. In such instances, there shall be no charge to the Government for cooperative program storage subsequent to the effective date of modification. Protection against unauthorized use, modification, or disclosure must be provided for files containing either computer programs or data. This protective role shall be twofold. One role is in the performance of authorization tests that relate user privileges to file restrictions levied by the file owner as to who may access the file and what may be done with the file contents. The other role is in the performance of validation tests that identify valid users. Regardless of the techniques employed, each subscribing activity will be responsible for determining the degree of privacy to be associated with any data created or stored on the system by that activity and whether the contractor's network will provide that degree of security required. 1. Restriction of file access must be applied in the following frames of reference: a. File Restrictions (1) Public - open to all subscribers of the offeror's network service (2) Federal - open to all Federal Government subscribers as designated by the file owner (3) Selected Private - open only to users designated by the file owner (4) Private - open only to the file owner b. Levels of Restriction (1) Execute Only - no dump or display (2) Read Only - read or execute, but no modification allowed (3) Unrestricted - all privileges, including on-line delegation/revocation of privileges c. Validation and Authorization (1) Validation tests must be performed to assure that only valid users have access to network services (2) Authorization tests determine if a validated user should have access to a file or files he requests directly or indirectly (programmatically). Users must not be granted access to any file unless authorized. 2. Access to programs and data via remote terminals must be inhibited at the file level, either at log-in time or request time. 3. Main memory and/or storage protection must be assured in areas where authorization and validation are being conducted. H.10. OFFEROR MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY

48

DTNH22-12-R-00542 Timesharing Services for Problem Driver Pointer System
The contractor is responsible for the maintenance of any communications network, all network hardware, and contractor-supplied software that supports the government's requirements. The contractor's network maintenance responsibility shall begin at the point of interface between the Government's network (terminal or Governmentprovided communications facility, if any) and the contractor's network. In addition, the contractor is responsible for communications service supplied to him by a communications common carrier or communications supplier to the extent that the contractor can demonstrate he has taken reasonable and prudent action to assure the common carrier's or communications supplier's performance in the support and operation of his teleprocessing network. H.11. DOCUMENTATION All functions of the network shall be clearly documented in a published form or as on-line files that can be listed and reproduced. Published documentation or on-line files shall include, but are not limited to a description of the network, including a schematic of the configuration(s); manuals covering programming languages; manuals describing network operation; manuals describing diagnostic messages, together with appropriate recovery actions; manuals describing application packages available; manuals describing security features (including a schematic of calling sequences), administrative procedures, and system auditing procedures; and other documentation normally supplied to subscribers. The contractor shall provide all changes to the documentation, including but not limited to periodic updates, at least 30 days prior to the effective date of any change. Notification of significant changes or errors detected in documentation that affect user utilization in programming or implementation of program library software shall be provided to all users of the network within five (5) days following such detection. Charges for services shall not be made nor shall a user pay for time lost on the system if the NHTSA CO determines that the contractor did not comply with the above requirements. H.12. HANDLING OF REMOVABLE STORAGE MEDIA All removable storage media and disk packs held by the contractor for or on behalf of the Government, must be subject to accountability and inventory control. Also, these media must receive suitable environmental protection and conditioning. An example of conditioning is conditioning new magnetic tapes to the computer center environment for 24 hours prior to use in IT operations. The contractor warrants that his media handling policies and practices shall provide protection against damage, loss, or misplacement by reason of carelessness or negligence. H.13. SAFEGUARDS Adequate protection must be provided for the Government subscriber's databases. To that end, the contractor is expected to provide administrative, technical, and physical safeguards against threats and hazards to the security and confidentiality of data. The contractor warrants that the safeguards described in Section C.5.8 of this contract (Data Protection and Safeguards) will be provided as described. The Government reserves the right to conduct a program review and inspection of the contractor's safeguards. H.13.1. Audit and Maintenance of Safeguards For the purposes of reviewing or inspecting the adequacy of the contractor's safeguards against threats or hazards to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of data, of safeguarding against new or unanticipated threats or hazards, and of protecting the confidentiality of the details of safeguards, the contractor agrees to the following: H.13.1.1 The NHTSA COTR or his or her designee shall be afforded full, free, and uninhibited access to all facilities and installations, all technical capabilities and operations, and all documentation, records, and databases

49

DTNH22-12-R-00542 Timesharing Services for Problem Driver Pointer System
for the purpose of carrying out a program of inspection to ensure the continued efficacy and efficiency of safeguards against threats and hazards to data security, integrity, and confidentiality. If the contractor has had a comprehensive security audit performed by an independent third party within the last 12 months, and this audit includes, at a minimum, those security features covered by contract requirements, a certification from that third party may be accepted in lieu of an NDR-performed security audit. The certification must be provided to the NHTSA COTR within 10 days of request. Failure of the offeror to maintain the levels of administrative control and security as described herein may constitute sufficient cause for applying the provisions of the "Default Clause" (FAR 52.249-8).

H.13.1.2 In the event that new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either the Government or the contractor, or in the event that existing safeguards have ceased to function, the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other party. The parties shall then reach mutual agreement on changes or corrections to existing safeguards or institution of new safeguards, with the Government making the final determination of appropriateness. The Government shall not be liable for claims of loss of business, damage to reputation, or damages of any other kind arising from discovery of new or unanticipated threats or hazards, or any public or private disclosure thereof. H.13.1.3 The details of any and all safeguards that the contractor may design or develop for this contract or that may be revealed to him during the course of performing under this contract shall become and shall remain the property of the Government and shall not be published or disclosed in any manner without the express written consent of the Government. H.14. DISPOSITION OF GOVERNMENT DATA FILES The contractor shall write to the NHTSA COTR and request written instructions regarding disposition of user files. The contractor shall make the request no later than 45 days before the end of the contract base year and each option year, or when 80 percent of the dollar limitation of the contract is expended, whichever occurs first. The notice to exercise an option year will be mailed 60 days before the end of each 12-month period. If the notice is not received, the contractor shall request instructions from the NHTSA COTR for disposition. The contractor shall be responsible for retaining files until disposition instructions have been received. Upon expiration or termination of the contract, data files belonging to the Government shall be disposed of as follows:     All data files residing on disk shall be transferred to the location and in the code and format specified by the NHTSA COTR. The cost of the transfer shall be borne by the Government. Files may not be converted and stored in a proprietary mode unless specifically agreed to by the Government. Backup files needed to maintain data integrity shall be retained pending notice from the NHTSA COTR that transfer of data files has been successfully completed. When notified by the NHTSA COTR, all data files shall be erased or destroyed so that the data cannot be accessed.

H.15. ETHICS AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT (JUN 2009) H.15.1. Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest a. It is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) policy not to award contracts to offerors whose objectivity may be impaired because of any related past, present or currently planned interest, financial or otherwise, in organizations regulated by NHTSA or in organizations whose interests may be substantially affected by NHTSA activities. Based on this policy: b. The offeror shall provide a statement in its technical proposal which describes in a concise manner all past, present or currently planned organizational, financial, contractual or other interest(s) with an organization regulated by NHTSA or with an organization whose interests may be substantially affected by NHTSA activities, and which is related to the work under the request. The interest(s) described shall include those of the offeror, its affiliates, proposed consultants, proposed subcontractors and key personnel of any of the above. Past interest shall be limited to within one year of the date of the offeror's technical proposal. Affected organizations shall include, but are not limited to, the insurance industry. Key personnel shall include any person owning more than a 20% interest in the offering firm, and the offeror's corporate officers, its senior managers and any employee who is responsible for making a decision or taking an action on this contract where the decision or action can have an economic or other impact on the interests of a regulated or affected organization. c. The offeror shall describe in detail why it believes, in light of the interest(s) identified in (a) above, that performance of the proposed contract can be accomplished in an impartial and objective manner. d. In the absence of any relevant interest identified in (a) above, the offeror shall submit in its technical proposal a statement certifying that to its best knowledge and belief, no affiliation exists relevant to possible conflicts of interest. The offeror must obtain the same information from potential subcontractors prior to award of a subcontract. e. The Contracting Officer will review the statement submitted and may require additional relevant information from the offeror. All such information and any other relevant information known to NHTSA will be used to determine whether an award to the offeror may create a conflict of interest. If such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (a) disqualify the offeror, or (b) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded. f. The refusal to provide the disclosure or representation, or any additional information as required may result in disqualification of the offeror for award. If nondisclosure or misrepresentation is discovered after award, the resulting contract may be terminated. If after award, the Contractor discovers a conflict of interest with respect to this contract which could not reasonably have been known prior to award; an immediate and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer. The disclosure shall include a description of the action which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate such conflict. The Contracting Officer may, however, determine that it is necessary to terminate the contract. H.15.2. Access to Sensitive Information Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information* which shall not be disclosed by the contractor unless authorized by the contracting officer. To protect sensitive information, the contractor shall provide training to any contractor employee authorized access to sensitive information and, upon request of the

51

DTNH22-12-R-00542 Timesharing Services for Problem Driver Pointer System
Government, provide information as to an individual's suitability to have such authorization. Contractor employees found by the Government to be un-suitable or whose employment is deemed contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security may be prevented from performing work under the particular contract when requested by the contracting officer. The contractor shall ensure that contractor employees are citizens of the United States of America or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence or employment (indicated by immigration status) as evidenced by investigations in accordance with DOT Order 1632.20, Personnel Security Management. The contractor shall include the above requirements in any subcontract awarded involving access to Government facilities, sensitive information, and/or resources. *Sensitive Information is proprietary data or other information that, if subject to unauthorized access, modification, loss or misuse could adversely affect national interest, conduct of Federal programs, or privacy of individuals specified in the Privacy Act, but has not been specifically authorized to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy under an Executive Order or Act of Congress. H.15.3. Contractor Identification Clause All contractor personnel using DOT information technology and communications systems (including the DOT email system), attending internal or external meetings, answering Government telephones, and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of Government employees, other contractor personnel or members of the public that they are Government officials, unless, in the judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. Among other things, contractor personnel must include the following signature block in all email communications, internal or external, and in all internal written documents. Contractor Employee Name Contractor Employee Title Name of Contractor Include the following statement "On assignment to NHTSA." For example: John Doe Project Manager ABC, Inc. On assignment at NHTSA

Contractor employees also must ensure that all documents or reports produced by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed. Under no circumstances shall contractor personnel sign letters or make other external communications on NHTSA letterhead, nor shall contractor personnel use the NHTSA or DOT logos or seals in letterhead, business cards, correspondence, emails, reports, documents or other communications. H.15.4. STANDARDS OF EMPLOYEE CONDUCT The contractor is responsible for maintaining satisfactory standards for employee competency, conduct, and integrity.

DTNH22-12-R-00542 Timesharing Services for Problem Driver Pointer System SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

M.1 EVALUATION, NEGOTIATIONS AND AWARD PROCESS: The Government will use the following process in reviewing proposals submitted in response to this solicitation. M.1.1 The evaluation process designed for this procurement will be of a three-phased nature. PHASE ONE Review of Response to the Technical Questionnaire (Section L.6 and Attachment (1)). Attachment (1) will be reviewed to ensure the offeror has cited sections of its technical proposal that respond to each and every NDR Requirement listed on the Technical Questionnaire. Failure to cross-reference each NDR Requirement to the corresponding response in the offeror's technical proposal will disqualify the offeror from further award consideration. PHASE TWO Review of Technical Proposals. Once it has been established that the offeror has responded to each and every requirement listed in the Technical Questionnaire, the Offeror's Technical Proposal will be reviewed in detail. This review will be made independently of any cost or pricing information and will use the Evaluation Factors presented in Paragraph M.2 below. PHASE THREE Evaluation of Price Proposals - The Government will evaluate the offeror's proposed price by means of price analysis, as described in FAR 15.404-1 (b)(1), Price Analysis, and FAR 15.403-1(c)(1), Adequate Price Competition. M.1.2 Negotiations may be conducted with those offerors whose technically acceptable proposals, combined with their price proposals, place them in the competitive range. However, as permitted by FAR 15.306.(c).2. the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. M.1.3 Negotiations will be conducted to the extent deemed necessary by the Government. However, offerors are cautioned to submit proposals on the most favorable basis since the government reserves the right to make an award without discussion, in accordance with FAR 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition. M.1.4 The Evaluation Factors set forth in M.2 will be used in evaluating technical proposals. Technical considerations are primary. Prices will not be accorded any specific numerical rating. If there are no significant technical proposal differences, price may be the determining factor for source selection. An offeror whose price is high(er) may be accepted if technical considerations make the offer most advantageous to the Government. M.1.5 Any contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, represents the best value to the government.

75

DTNH22-12-R-00542 Timesharing Services for Problem Driver Pointer System
M.2 EVALUATION FACTORS: Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria. The factors are listing in descending order of importance when Factor M.2.1 "Technical Approach" is most important and Factor M.2.3 "Corporate Experience and Past Performance" is least important. M.2.1Technical Approach (See L.9.2.4) The offeror will be evaluated on the soundness and clarity of its technical approach to addressing the requirements of this contract. As part of the evaluation, a determination will be made as to whether the offeror presents a reasonable approach to ensuring the successful migration of the PDPS application to a hybrid cloud infrastructure and that the approach for hosting/administration of the PDPS application environment allows for continued, uninterrupted operation. The offeror also will be evaluated on its approach to integrating aspects of quality control, including providing feedback to staff, and taking actions to reduce or eliminate errors. The offeror will be evaluated on the soundness of its approach to resolving or avoiding any risks it identifies in its hosting/administration efforts. The offeror will be evaluated on meeting technical requirements in its approach to meeting contract requirements, and whether the approach provides constructive feedback aimed at helping to improve current infrastructure efforts. M.2.2 Staff Qualifications (See L.9.2.5) The offeror will be evaluated on the quality and suitability of its proposed professional and technical personnel. The level of experience held and education obtained by key staff personnel will be compared to their proposed assigned duties to evaluate suitability. M.2.3 Corporate Experience / Past Performance (See L.9.2.6) The offeror will be evaluated on its level of experience in providing database administration and hosting services similar to that described in this RFP. The offeror also will be evaluated on the quality of services provided in the past. This includes the contractor's compliance with established contractual milestone dates. The degree to which the contractor took aggressive actions to mitigate the effect of missed deadlines will be considered. The degree to which past customers were satisfied with services received from the offeror will be reviewed. Note: Offerors, for which no historical record of past performance has been established, will only be rated on "Corporate Experience" for this factor. Offerors, whose established record of past performance is poor, will be given a "poor" rating for the evaluation factor. M.3 PRICE EVALUATION M.3.1 The government will review the Offeror's completed Section B and Section M.4 Price Evaluation Schedules to this RFP. In reviewing prices, the government will assess the degree to which they are realistic (when compared to the RFP's stated requirements) fair, and reasonable. Total prices proposed for each base and option year will be reviewed for balance (i.e. there are no unusually low, or high total prices set for a given contract year.) Proposed prices, and any changes to those prices resulting from negotiations, will be used to establish the firm fixed prices for each base and option period. M.3.2. The Offeror is placed on notice that any proposal that is unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or unrealistically low in cost price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of contract requirements, and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.
