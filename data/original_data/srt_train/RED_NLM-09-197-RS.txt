                                                                Statement of Work


       BACKGROUND


       The National Library of Medicine (NLM) provides efficient, cost-effective information technology services in support of the research and
       management programs offered through the National Institutes of Health.  The National Library of Medicine is a partner of the Bethesda
       Hospitals’ Emergency Preparedness Partnership (BHEPP), whose other members are the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC), National
       Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIH/CC), and Suburban Hospital Healthcare System.






       BHEPP’s main goals include:

        I. Respond rapidly and successfully to any emergency situation;
       II. Integrate the collaborative response with other community, regional, and national responses and
      III. Create collaborative structures and process to serve as an exportable model for other similar centers in the Nation



       The National Library of Medicine is spearheading the planning, procurement and implementation of a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
       / Real Time Location System (RTLS) for the Bethesda Hospitals’ Emergency Preparedness Partnership (BHEPP).






       OBJECTIVES


       This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the goals and requirements that the selected Contractor(s) shall meet to provide an RFID/RTLS that
       aligns with the BHEPP requirements. The Contractor(s) shall furnish the necessary personnel, products, materials and other services
       required to accomplish the services requested in this SOW.  At all times, the Contractor(s) shall ensure that the RFID/RTLS
       implementations are in compliance with the corresponding BHEPP Partner policies, guidelines, and standards, as well as industry best
       practices.


       The BHEPP has identified a critical need for the acquisition of a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) / Real Time Location System
       (RTLS) to directly support the current emergency preparedness initiatives of three of its members, namely, the National Naval Medical
       Center, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, and Suburban Hospital Healthcare System.  The BHEPP requires a system that will
       operate on a stand-alone network, separate from BHEPP partner production networks, and a scalable system that can be implemented
       incrementally as more requirements are requested by the Partnership.   The RFID/RTLS solution shall incorporate role-based access so as
       to provide BHEPP the ability to track patients and assets across all three hospitals, while at the same time providing each of the
       hospitals the ability to track their own patients and assets.


       Initial RFID/RTLS requirements will focus on patient tracking, inventory management, disaster exercise support, and systems integration
       as outlined below:





        I. Patient Tracking: Tracking of disaster victims within each of the Partnership facilities, and of stable medical/surgical patients
           being transported among facilities during mass casualty situations.


       II. Critical Asset Management: Managing/tracking critical assets to ensure easy location and mobilization during mass casualty
           situations.




      III. Systems Integration: Providing necessary application program interfaces (APIs) to facilitate the integration of the RFID/RTLS system
           with other BHEPP disaster response applications through open standards.

       IV. Disaster Exercise Support: Support collaborative multi-agency disaster exercises to demonstrate the effectiveness of RFID/RTLS
           technology in patient tracking and inventory management during mass casualty situations.





       Information gathered under this SOW is the property of National Library of Medicine, BHEPP and its partners and no aspect of this
       information shall be divulged in any fashion to any party without the express written approval from National Library Medicine Contracting
       Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).






       Tasking will be performed primarily at the facilities of the Suburban Hospital, National Naval Medical Center, and National Institutes of
       Health Clinical Center.  Meetings and coordination activities will be conducted at National Library Medicine Buildings 38 and 38A,
       National Institutes of Health main campus, located in Bethesda, Maryland, in addition to the other BHEPP partner locations.






       The NLM reserves the right to make multiple awards for the initial Base Task described in Article C.5.  At the discretion of the NLM, the
       deliverables for the Base Task will be further evaluated to determine which Contractor(s) will be awarded the Optional Tasks described in
