Section C - Description/Specification/Work Statement for Data Management and Technical Assistance for Division for Heart Disease and Stroke
Prevention -- WISEWOMAN Program


C.1     Statement of Work (Jul 1999)

The Contractor shall provide the necessary services and supplies as described in the Statement of Work, incorporated by reference in Section J.

(End of Clause)


C.2     Background and Need

In 1993, Congress authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish the Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for
Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) Program to extend the services that are provided to women as part of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer
Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). The WISEWOMAN Program is administered through the Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention.

The priority population for WISEWOMAN is women aged 40-64 who are enrolled in NBCCEDP.  The program provides NBCCEDP participants with access to
additional preventive health services by screening for heart disease and stroke risk factors and using national clinical care guidelines to
refer women to quality care.  The program also provides lifestyle interventions that are tailored to each woman’s heart disease and stroke risk
factor screening results and her readiness to make lifestyle behavior changes.

In 2008 CDC released Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) DP08-804, which began a new 5-year funding cycle for the WISEWOMAN Program.  The
goals of the WISEWOMAN Program under the new FOA include:

 -- Maximizing the reach of the program (i.e., provide services to as many women as possible)
 -- Working to eliminate health disparities (by serving those most in need).
 -- Decreasing heart disease and stroke risk factors of the WISEWOMAN population.
 -- Maximizing the number and variety of settings that deliver WISEWOMAN services (e.g., screening, lifestyle intervention).
 -- Ensuring that WISEWOMAN is delivered as intended (i.e., direct services are implemented with fidelity).
 -- Sustaining the benefits of WISEWOMAN over time at the individual level (e.g., linking participants to low-cost community-based resources
 that support heart health) and organizational level (e.g., implementing policies and procedures that reflect a focus on primary prevention and
 follow national guidelines).

Standardized minimum data elements (MDEs) are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division for Heart Disease and
Stroke Prevention by WISEWOMAN grantees.  The MDEs consist primarily of information about screening values, personal health history, family
healthy history, lifestyle intervention services, and demographic data of women who are provided screening and lifestyle intervention services
for heart disease and stroke prevention with funds provided through the WISEWOMAN Program.  The MDEs were developed as a result of a
collaborative effort between grantees and the CDC as a set of data that grantees report to CDC regularly. The MDEs help to ensure that programs
collect consistent and complete information such as screening location, patient demographic characteristics, screening results, lifestyle
intervention services, and changes in screening values over time. MDEs also assist state/territorial health departments and tribes/tribal
organizations in directing, monitoring, and evaluating their screening and lifestyle intervention programs; provide state legislatures and other
constituents with evidence of the success of the program components; and are used to address inquires regarding the progress of the program
across sites/grantees.

The MDEs, collected for each screening and lifestyle intervention event, are computerized, converted into a standard format by the grantee and
transmitted to the CDC/Contractor twice a year via a web-based application. Due dates for the MDE submission are April 15 and October 15.  The
first MDE submission, under this contract, is October 15, 2009.

Following the semi-annual data submission, data quality checks are performed to ensure adherence to reporting standards, an analysis dataset is
created, and an extensive set of program monitoring reports for the WISEWOMAN Program at the CDC-level and individual grantee level are
generated.

A Contractor has been responsible for the ongoing user support and maintenance of the MDE data system and infrastructure.  This contract will
support system maintenance, any additional development required, and provide for the system to be refined to facilitate and support the evolving
needs of the WISEWOMAN Program.

The data system consists of several major components.

    • The MDE Edit Program is an executable program developed to assist grantees and CDC in validating the MDE data at the record level for
      logical, range, and skip errors.  The MDE edit program is available to grantees for routine data quality checks, and is used by CDC to
      validate the semi-annual data submission.  The MDE edit program is provided to grantees free of charge and will be supported by this
      contract.

    • Each of the grantees has the option to use any database management system of their choice.  The main database includes all of the MDE
      elements. The system will likely be Internet-based restricted access for funded programs and CDC only.  However, programs can maintain
      their own program-specific data bases (housed at the State)  but must upload data into the main database that is maintained by the
      contractor.

    • The MDE SAS analysis dataset currently consists of over 150,000 screening observations and over 250,000 lifestyle intervention observations
      comprised of 56 variables with an expected annual increase of 300,000 screening observations and 500,000 lifestyle intervention observation
      or records.

A restricted use Web site is available to grantees to facilitate the delivery of data, services, software, reports, and information to support
the data requirements of the WISEWOMAN Program. The hosting and provision of this website will be fully supported by this contract.

Although heart disease and stroke are commonly believed to affect men much more than women, more than half of all people who die of these
diseases are women.  Heart disease and stroke are the first and third leading causes of death among American women.  Beyond deaths, heart
disease and stroke pose a tremendous burden to women in terms of disease and disability.  Nearly 43 million U.S. women have a history of heart
disease and stroke, including 7.3 million women who have coronary heart disease and 3.4 million women who have suffered a stroke.

In 2008, the total cost of heart disease and stroke for the United States is projected to be more than $448 billion.  This cost includes health
care expenditures and lost work productivity.  This economic burden disproportionately affects people with limited resources.  Low-income women
are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured; to have less access to health care services; and to be unable to pay for needed prevention,
screening, and treatment services.

In terms of their health, low-income women are more likely to smoke and be overweight, which increases their risk for developing heart disease
and stroke.  They also are less likely to be physically active and aware of their blood pressure and cholesterol levels.  Addressing these and
other risk factors, such as diabetes, an unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity, greatly reduces women’s risk for illness and death from heart
disease and stroke.

Unfortunately, prevention, screening, and treatment are often beyond the reach of uninsured and underinsured women.  Low-income adults in the
United States are less likely to be screened for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and they are less likely to be advised by a health
care professional to lose weight and quit smoking.

In 1995, CDC funded three State research programs to test whether enhanced lifestyle interventions were more effective than lifestyle
interventions that used minimal or usual care.  In 2001, Congress authorized an expansion of the WISEWOMAN Program that allowed CDC to fund up
to 15 organizations.  With this expansion, CDC began funding both research and non-research WISEWOMAN programs.  Under this model, the research
programs maintained their original design and the non-research programs focused on service delivery while evaluating the feasibility of
implementing evidence-informed lifestyle interventions in local settings without the use of control groups.

In 2008, the legislative cap of 15 programs was lifted and 19 States and 2 Tribal Organizations were funded under DP08-804 to implement
WISEWOMAN.  Under DP08-804, the grantees have moved from a research phase to service delivery and public health practice.  It is expected that
WISEWOMAN will maintain level or moderately increased funding through the end of this 5-year contract period with expansion similar to what we
have experienced in the past. (Between 2004 and 2008 the Program grew from 15 grantees to 21 grantees.) Grantees receive financial assistance
and technical support to conduct the program activities for a project period of up to 5 years.

To comply with the mandates established by 42 U.S.C. Section 300k of the Public Health Service act, as amended, the WISEWOMAN Program must
evaluate its activities through appropriate surveillance and program–monitoring activities.

Information collected by the grantees will be used to direct CDC’s WISEWOMAN Program development; to assist state/territorial health departments
and tribes/tribal organizations in establishing, directing, monitoring, and evaluating their programs; to provide state legislatures and
congress with ongoing evidence of the success of the programs’ screening, lifestyle intervention, and follow-up components; to respond to
congressional inquiries on the progress of the program; to provide information for CDC’s mandated annual report to Congress; to share program
results with the general public; and to support appropriate secondary research activities.

C.3     Project Objective

The primary purpose of this contract is to provide system support and technical assistance to facilitate collection and analysis of standardized
data elements. These data will be used to evaluate accomplishments and to provide extensive technical assistance and consultation that promote
program improvement and efficiency to CDC’s WISEWOMAN Program and its grantees

     Government.


2)  Perform data analysis and reporting

   (a)  Receive, log and process semi-annual MDE submission data from grantees.


   (b) Semi-annual MDE submission data received from the grantees will constitute the input data. Reports will include national/aggregate data,
   individual grantee data, and a comparison of data across programs/grantees. They will be used to describe the program, measure progress and
   performance, summarize data quality, and provide feedback. (Deliverable 3)


   (c)  Establish and document algorithms to consistently measure, analyze and report MDE data, including screening and lifestyle intervention
   performance measures, clinical outcomes (i.e., changes in risk), performance benchmarks and outliers.


   (d) Validate the MDE submission data using the MDE Edit Program.  Identify, monitor, and evaluate data quality problems.


   (e) Work with grantees to correct specific errors noted by the Edit Program, such as duplicate records or miscoded values, prior to creation

from any stipulation of this contract.

(End of Clause)


G.2  Project Officer (Jul 1999)

Performance of the work hereunder shall be subject to the technical directions of the designated  Project Officer for this contract.

As used herein, technical directions are directions to the Contractor which fill in details, suggests possible lines of inquiry, or otherwise
completes the general scope of work set forth herein.  These technical directions must be within the general scope of work, and may not alter
the scope of work or cause changes of such a nature as to justify an adjustment in the stated contract price/cost, or any stated limitation
thereof.  In the event that the Contractor feels that full implementation of any of these directions may exceed the scope of the contract, he or
she shall notify the originator of the technical direction and the Contracting Officer in a letter separate of any required report(s) within two
(2) weeks of the date of receipt of the technical direction and no action shall be taken pursuant to the direction.  If the Contractor fails to
provide the required notification within the said two (2) week period that any technical direction exceeds the scope of the contract, then it
shall be deemed for purposes of this contract that the technical direction was within the scope.  No technical direction, nor its fulfillment,

(a) For the performance of this contract, the Government shall reimburse the Contractor the cost determined by the Contracting Officer to be
allowable (hereinafter referred to as allowable cost) in accordance with the clause entitled Allowable Cost and Payment in Section I, Contract
Clauses. Examples of allowable costs include, but are not limited to, the following:

services required under this contract. These costs will be in accordance with the Contractor’s policy and subject to the following:

(i) Air travel shall be by the most direct route using “air coach” or “air tourist” (less than first class) unless it is clearly unreasonable or

    Award Fee:  The award fee (difference between the base fee and maximum fee) will be paid to the contractor based on its performance in
accordance with Section H.13, Performance-Based Award Fee Criteria.  The Government will promptly make payment of any Award Fee upon the

G.8  Evaluation of Contractor Performance (Service) (Jan 2000)

(a)  Purpose

In accordance with FAR 42.1502, the Contractor's performance will be periodically evaluated by the Government, in order to provide current
information for source selection purposes.  These evaluations will therefore be marked “Source Selection Information.”

(b)  Performance Evaluation Period

The Contractor's performance will be evaluated at least annually.

(c)  Evaluators

The performance evaluation will be completed jointly by the Project officer and the Contracting officer.

(d)  Performance Evaluation Factors

The contractor's performance will be evaluated in accordance with the attachment listed in Section J titled Performance Evaluation Report.

submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information to the Contracting Officer within 30 calendar days after receipt of the
evaluation.

(f)  Resolving Disagreements Between the Government and the Contractor

Disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation will be reviewed at a level above the Contracting Officer.  The ultimate conclusion

award fee to be paid is determined by the Government’s judgmental evaluation of the contractor’s performance in terms of the criteria stated in
the contract. This determination and the methodology for determining the award fee are unilateral decisions made solely at the discretion of the
Government.  If all options are exercised, the maximum estimated cost-plus-award-fee is estimated at $___TBD__________. 

   (1)      The offeror will propose a fee applicable to this work.  The maximum Total Available Fee shall not exceed 10% of proposed costs.

   (2)      The Total Available Fee shall consist of  an Award Fee Amount and a Base Fee Amount (which may be zero).  The Base Fee Amount shall
function in the same manner as a Fixed Fee and shall not exceed 5% of proposed costs.

   (3)      The offeror may propose any Base Fee Amount and any Award Fee Amount, provided that the Total Available Fee does not exceed 10% of
proposed costs, and the Base Fee Amount does not exceed 5% of proposed costs.  The Base Fee Amount may be zero.

   (4)       For example, the Base Fee Amount could be proposed as 0% and the Award Fee amount could be proposed as 8%.  Alternatively, the Base
Fee Amount could be proposed as 5% and the Award Fee amount could be proposed as 3%.  Alternatively, the Base Fee Amount could be proposed as 2%
and the Award Fee amount could be proposed as 6%.  In all of these examples, the Total Available Fee is 8%

   (5)       The amount of the Total Available Fee will be used for evaluation purposes.

G.11  Billing Instructions for Negotiated Cost-Type Contracts (Mar 2006)

Billing Instructions for Negotiated Cost-Type Contracts
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Introduction
Reimbursement procedures related to negotiated cost-type contracts require that Contractors submit to the Government adequately prepared  claims.
The instructions that follow are  provided  for  Contractors’  use  in  the  preparation  and  submission  of  invoices  or  vouchers  requesting
reimbursement for work performed. The preparation of invoices or vouchers as outlined below will aid in the review and  approval  of  claims  and
enable prompt payment to the Contractor.

1. Forms to Be Used

In requesting reimbursement, Contractors may use the regular Government voucher form, Standard Form  1034,  “Public  Voucher  for  Purchases  and
Services Other Than Personal,” and Standard Form 1035, “Continuation Sheet,” or the Contractor’s own invoice form. If the Contractor  desires  to
use the Government’s standard forms, a request for the forms should be submitted to the Contracting Officer.  If  the  Contractor  uses  his  own
invoice, the billing must conform with the instructions set forth herein.


Submission of Invoices or Vouchers

All original invoices or vouchers must be submitted to the Financial Management Office at the address  show  below  on  a  monthly  or  quarterly
basis:

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Financial Management Office (FMO)
P.O. Box 15580
Atlanta, GA  30333

Or – The Contractor may submit the original invoice/voucher or progress payment via facsimile or email:

Fax:  404-638-5324

Email:  FMOAPINV@CDC.GOV

NOTE:  Submit to only one (1) of the above locations.


In addition, the contractor shall submit 2 copies of the invoice/voucher or progress payment to the cognizant contracting office previously
identified in this contract.  These invoices/voucher copies shall be addressed to the attention of the Contracting Officer.


REMINDER: The original and each copy should be easily identifiable. Vouchers should be collated. Failure to submit vouchers in the proper  format
will delay your payment.





3.   Preparation of Invoices or Vouchers

a.  EXHIBIT I – Summary of All Costs

As shown on the attached Standard Form 1034, identified as EXHIBIT I (SAMPLE), a summary of  all  current  costs  must  be  shown.  This  summary
consists of a list identifying the general categories and the amounts incurred during the period  covered  by  the  billing,  together  with  the
portion of fixed fee (if any) payable for that period. The reimbursable costs incurred and the dates of the period  for  which  the  charges  are
claimed must fall within the period specified in the contract.



b.  EXHIBIT II – Details of Costs Claimed

As shown on the attached Standard Form 1035, identified as EXHIBIT II (SAMPLE), a  detailed  breakdown  must  be  provided  to  substantiate  the
categories shown on the summary of costs (see EXHIBIT I). The following describes some of the categories that might appear on your billings:

 (1)   Direct Labor

Direct Labor costs consist of salaries and wages paid for scientific, technical, and other work performed directly for the contract and  pursuant
to the contract terms. Labor costs, excluding fringe benefits and overtime premium pay, will be billed as follows:

List the titles and amounts for employees whose salaries or wages, or portions thereof, were charged to the contract; show the  rate  (or  hours)
worked, and amount for each individual. The cost of direct labor, which is charged directly to the contract, must be supported  by  time  records
maintained in the contractor’s office.

(2) Fringe Benefits

If it is the Contractor’s established practice to treat fringe benefits as a direct cost, such costs should be  billed  separately  as  a  single
item.

NOTE: Fringe benefits, bonuses, etc., are usually treated as indirect costs for inclusion in the overhead pool; however, they may be  treated  as
direct labor costs or as an “Other Direct Charge” if such treatment is in accordance with the Contractor’s established accounting procedures.

(3) Premium Pay

Premium pay is the difference between the rates and amounts paid for overtime or shift work and amount normally paid on a  straight  time  basis.
Generally such pay is not included in the direct labor base and should not be included in the billing for “direct labor”  unless  the  Contractor
has consistently followed this practice in the past as a matter of policy. Premium pay of any kind unless provided for in the  contract  must  be
authorized by the Contracting Officer in advance. Billings for  unauthorized  premium  pays  have  caused  frequent  delays  in  payment  due  to
suspensions and exchange of correspondence. Citations of authorization for premium pay will avoid delays in payment. Authorized premium  pay  may
be shown as a single item on the summary of costs. However, it must be separately itemized for  each  position,  or  job  category,  showing  the
amount, and a citation of the Contracting Officer’s letter of authorization on the continuation sheet of the invoice or voucher.

(4) Materials and Supplies

Only those items, which the Contractor normally treats as “direct costs”,  should  be  claimed  under  this  heading.  Major  classifications  of
material only should be billed separately under appropriate classification. Items  costing  less  than  $25.00  may  be  listed  by  category  of
materials or supplies. Show the description and dollar amount  of  individual  classifications.  All  such  charges  must  be  supported  by  the
Contractor’s office records.

 (5)   Travel

When authorized in the contract as a direct cost, travel costs that are directly related to specific contract performance  may  be  billed  as  a
direct cost. Travel cost detail should show:

    (a)    Name of traveler and official title,

    (b)    Purpose of trip,

   (c) Dates of departure and return to starting point (station or airport),

   (d) Transportation costs, identified as to rail, air, private automobile (including mileage and rate) and taxi.

   e)  If claim for subsistence is on per diem basis, show number of days, rate and amount, as authorized in contract.[1] If claim  is  based  on
   actual cost of subsistence, show, on a daily basis, the amounts claimed for lodging and meals separately.

     f) Reference to Contracting Officer’s letter of authorization if required by contract.

    (6)    Consultant Fees
Identify the consultant by name, number of days utilized, and amount of fee.
(7) Equipment
Nonexpendable personal property must be specifically approved in writing by the Contracting Officer or authorized by the terms of  the  contract.
Billing data should include a description of item, make model, quantity, unit cost, total cost, and date approved by the Contracting Officer,  if
applicable. A copy of the vendor’s bill may be submitted in lieu of the identifying information.
(8) Burden
Pending establishment of final contract indirect cost rates for each of the Contractor’s fiscal years, the Contractor will  be  reimbursed  based
on his submittal of provisional rates as set forth in the contract. The contract may provide for more than one type indirect cost rate,  such  as
overhead rate, and general and administrative expense rate, in which case the direct cost bases (e.g., direct labor, total direct cost, etc.)
(9) Fixed Fee
Ordinarily the fixed fee is stated in the contract as a lump sum and may be billed in the ratio of incurred costs to total estimated cost as  set
forth in the contract, with the final 15 percent to be billed on the final invoice or voucher. Contract terms govern the method of payments.
c.  EXHIBIT III – Cumulative Amount Claimed
As shown on the attached Standard Form 1035, identified as EXHIBIT III (SAMPLE), the Contractor must  show  the  cumulative  amounts  claimed  by
categories from the contract award date through the date of the current invoice or voucher, as  well  as  the  estimated  cost  to  complete  per
category.

   b)  The NDA made part of this clause, exhibit I and II , is required in service contracts where positions and/or functions proposed to be
      filled by contractor’s employees will have access to non-public and procurement-sensitive information. The NDA also requires contractor’s
      employees properly identify themselves as employees of a contractor when communicating or interacting with CDC employees, employees of
      other governmental entities (when communication or interaction relates to the contractor’s work with the CDC), and members of the public.
      The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.114 (c), states “All contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones,
      and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such
      to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public or Congress that they are Government officials, unless, in the
      judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. They must also ensure that all documents or reports produced
      by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed.”

   c) The Contractor shall inform employees of the identification requirements by which they must abide and monitor employee compliance with the
      identification requirements.

   d) During the contract performance period, the Contractor is responsible to ensure that all additional or replacement contractors’ employees
      sign a NDA and it is submitted to the Contracting Officer prior to commencement of their work with the CDC.

   e) Contractor employees in designated positions or functions that have not signed the appropriate NDA shall not have access to any non-
      public, procurement sensitive information or participate in government meeting where sensitive information maybe discussed.

   f) The Contractor shall prepare and maintain a current list of employees working under NDAs and submit to the Contracting Officer upon
      request during the contract period of performance.  The list should at a minimum include: contract number, employee’s name, position, date
      of hire and NDA requirement.


                                                                    EXHIBIT I
                                                 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
                                                       Contractor Non-Disclosure Agreement

I. Non-public Information
 
[Name of contractor] understands that in order to fulfill the responsibilities pursuant to [Contract name and number] between the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and [Name of CDC contractor] dated [date], employees of [contractor] will have access to non-public information,
including confidential and privileged information contained in government-owned information technology systems. For purposes of this agreement,
confidential information means government information that is not or will not be generally available to the public. Privileged information means
information which cannot be disclosed without the prior written consent of the CDC.
 
In order to properly safeguard non-public information, [contractor] agrees to ensure that prior to being granted access to government
information or the commencement of work for the CDC, whichever is applicable, all employees will sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) provided
by the CDC prior to beginning work for the CDC. Contractor agrees to submit to the contracting official the original signed copies of NDAs
signed by the contractor’s employees in accordance with the instructions provided by the contracting official. Failure to provide signed NDAs in
accordance with this agreement and instructions provided by the contracting official could delay or prevent the employee from commencing or
continuing work at the CDC until such agreement is signed and returned to the contracting official.
 
Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner
or to any extent, to any individual other than an authorized Government employee any non-public information that the employee may obtain in
connection with the performance of the employee’s responsibilities to the CDC.
 
II. Procurement-Sensitive Information
 
Contractor further agrees that it will not cause or encourage any employee to disclose, publish, divulge, release, or make known in any manner
or to any extent, to any individual, other than an authorized Government employee, any procurement-sensitive information gained while in
connection with fulfilling the employee’s responsibilities at the CDC. For purposes of this agreement, procurement-sensitive information
includes, but is not limited to, all information in Statements of Work (SOW), Requests for Contract (RFC), and Requests for Proposal (RFP);
Responses to RFPs, including questions from potential offerors; non-public information regarding procurements; all documents, conversations,
discussions, data, correspondence, electronic mail (e-mail), presentations, or any other written or verbal communications relating to,
concerning, or affecting proposed or pending solicitations or awards; procurement data; contract information plans; strategies; source selection
information and documentation; offerors’ identities; technical and cost data; the identity of government personal involved in the solicitation;
the schedule of key technical and procurement events in the award determination process; and any other information that may provide an unfair
competitive advantage to a contractor or potential contractor if improperly disclosed to them, or any of their employees.
 
Contractor understands and agrees that employee access to any procurement-sensitive information may create a conflict of interest which will
preclude contractor from becoming a competitor for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information. Therefore, if an employee participates in
any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assists in developing any procurement-sensitive information, or otherwise obtains
any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing duties at the CDC, contractor understands and agrees that contractor are
be excluded from competing for any acquisition(s) resulting from this information.



III.    Identification of Non-Government Employees
 
Contractor understands that its employees are not agents of the Government. Therefore, unless otherwise directed in writing by the CDC,
contractor agrees to assist and monitor employee compliance with the following identification procedures:
 
        A.      At the beginning of interactions with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities, members of the public, or the
           media (when such communication or interaction relates to the contractor’s work with the CDC), contractors’ employees will identify

Requests for Proposal (RFP); Responses to RFPs, including questions from potential offerors; non-public information regarding procurements; all

I understand and agree that my access to any procurement-sensitive information may create a conflict of interest which will preclude me, my
current employer, or a future employer from becoming a competitor for any resulting government acquisition derived from this information.
Therefore, if I participate in any discussions relating to procurement-sensitive information, assist in developing any procurement-sensitive
information, or otherwise obtain any procurement-sensitive information during the course of performing my duties at the CDC, I understand and
agree that I, my current employer, and any future employer(s) are excluded from competing for any resulting acquisitions.

Therefore, I agree that unless I have prior written authorization from the CDC, I will, at the beginning of interactions with CDC employees,

H.19  HIPAA Privacy Regulations Clause

Pursuant to the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information   promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA)(45  CFR Parts 160 and 164), covered entities may disclose protected health information to public health authorities
“…authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability,
including, but not limited to, the reporting of disease, injury, vital events such as birth or death, and the conduct of public health
surveillance, public health investigations, and public health interventions…”  The definition of a public health authority ncludes “…a person or
entity acting under a grant of authority from or contract with such public agency…”  The (Name of contractor) is acting under contract with the
CDC to carry out (Title of Procurement), which is authorized by  statutory authority from Public Health Service Act, Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or other legislation and therefore may be considered a public health authority under the Privacy Rule
for purposes of this project.  Further, CDC considers this evaluation and monitoring of laboratory test performance for which disclosure of
protected health information by covered entities is authorized by section 164.512(b) of the Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.512(b).







H.19  Smoke Free Environment Certification (Sep 2008)

Smoke Free Environment Certification

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes that secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure poses serious health risks to nonsmokers.
SHS exposure in the workplace has been linked to an increased risk for heart disease and lung cancer among adult nonsmokers.  SHS has been
designated as a known carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) by the National Toxicology Program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and by
the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has concluded that SHS is an
occupational carcinogen.  There is no risk-free level of SHS exposure.  Separating smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating
buildings cannot eliminate this exposure.  SHS is an important preventable cause of death from cancer and other illnesses, and many Americans,
both adults and children, remain at significant risk from SHS exposure.

It is the CDC’s intent to protect the health of all CDC employees and reduce cancer and other serious health hazards caused by SHS exposure.
Therefore, all meetings and conferences organized and/or sponsored or co-sponsored by the CDC shall be held in a conference venue that provides
a smoke-free environment.  A smoke-free conference venue is defined as a venue that makes ALL public places in the hotel and in all meeting
facilities smoke-free.  This includes, but is not limited to, meeting rooms, common areas such as lobbies and hallways, all indoor public
spaces, all indoor employee work areas, restaurants (including restaurant bar areas), and lounges.

Conferences include symposia, seminars, workshops, and any other organized and formal meeting lasting one or more days, where CDC personnel
assemble to exchange information and views or explore or clarify a defined subject, problem, or area of knowledge.

CERTIFICATION:  Offeror’s acceptance of any resulting contract certifies that the meeting/conference venue provided is “smoke-free” and that all
CDC personnel attending said meeting/conference will be doing so in a smoke-free environment.


H.20  Observance of Legal Holidays and Administrative Leave (Government Facilities Performance) (Jan 2000)

(a) Holidays

Government personnel observe the following listed days as holidays:

President’s Day
Memorial Day
Independence Day
Labor Day
Veterans' Day
Thanksgiving Day
Christmas Day
New Year's Day
Columbus Day
Martin Luther King Day

Any other day designated by Federal Statute
Any other day designated by Executive Order
Any other day designated by Presidential proclamation

The Contractor shall observe the above holidays on the date observed by the Government.  Observance of such days by Government personnel shall
not “on-its-face” be cause for an additional period of performance, or entitlement of compensation except as set forth within the contract.
Contractor employees performing duties within Government facilities are automatically relieved from duty by virtue of the fact that Government
employees are dismissed early or given the day off, (with the exception of 24-hour/day service requirements).  No form of holiday or other
premium compensation will be reimbursed; however, this does not preclude reimbursement for authorized overtime work.

(b) Unscheduled Facility Closures

In the event the Government facilities are closed due to inclement weather, potentially hazardous conditions, and other special circumstances,
contractor personnel assigned to work within those facilities are automatically dismissed.  In this instance, the cost of salaries and wages for
the period of any such excused absence may be charged in the same manner as the effected employee’s regular time (direct cost for those
employees whose salaries are normally a direct cost; indirect cost for those employees whose salaries are normally an indirect cost), provided
that such charges are in accordance with the contractor's accounting system/policy.  In each instance, the Contractor agrees to continue to
provide sufficient personnel to perform round-the-clock requirements of critical tasks already in operation or scheduled, and shall be guided by
the instructions issued by the Contracting Officer or his duly appointed representative.

                 total price negotiated;


                 (F) The reasons for any significant difference between the Contractor’s price objective and the price negotiated; and

      (2) The Contractor is not required to notify the Contracting Officer in advance of entering into any subcontract for which consent is not
      required under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) or this clause.

of the Contractor’s purchasing system shall constitute a determination –

      (2) Of the allowability of any cost under this contract; or


      (3) To relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for performing this contract.

K.3  FAR 52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Dec 2008)

Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (December 2008)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that –

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals –

(A) Are  are not  presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal
agency;

(B) Have  have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local)
contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement,
theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or
receiving stolen property;

(C) Are  are not  presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the
offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.

(D) Have , have not , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds
$3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
           (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
           determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the
           liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
           (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when
           full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (2) Examples.
           (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court
           review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek
           Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
           (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a
           notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and
           to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of
           the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to
           contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court
           review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
           (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is
           in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make
           full payment.
           (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed
           under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has  has not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having
primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary,
division, or business segment; and similar positions).

This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or
Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

“In writing,” “writing,” or “written” means any worded or numbered expression which can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and
includes electronically transmitted and stored information.

“Proposal modification” is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation’s closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or
made to correct a mistake at any time before award.

“Proposal revision” is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer
as the result of negotiations.

“Time,” if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and
legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day.

(b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall
acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s).

shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages

(i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and

(ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using

the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m.,
local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due.

(ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified
for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that
accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and –

the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or

(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under
the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or

(3) It is the only proposal received.

(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered
at any time it is received and may be accepted.

(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on
the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government
personnel.

(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated
for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the
solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on
the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.

(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be

award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror

(e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for
any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall –

(1) Mark the title page with the following legend:

This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed – in whole or in
part – for for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of – or in
connection with – the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent
provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in this data if it is
obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other
identification of sheets]; and

(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:

Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.

(f) Contract award.

(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s)
represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.

(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s interest.

(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in
FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.
The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting
Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient
competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that
will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices
offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.

(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the
Government’s best interest to do so.

5.  508 Compliance of Electronic and Information Technology

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and
Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Provisions (36 CFR part 1194), require that, unless an
exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit:

(1) Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information
and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and

(2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and
data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.
Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established
EIT accessibility provisions. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section
508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access- board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm.
The Section 508 standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work. In order to facilitate the Government’s
evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an
HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The
purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support
applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and
document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Product
Assessment Template may be found at http://508.hhs.gov.
Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508
standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products and/or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an
exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products and/or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents
and reports, meet applicable Section 508 standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by
the Government – i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products and/or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility in
the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor’s Product
Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its expense.


L.6  Inquiries (May 1998)

Inquiries concerning the solicitation document should be submitted in writing to the issuing office.  Any additions, deletions, or changes to
the solicitation will be made by an amendment.  OFFERORS ARE INSTRUCTED SPECIFICALLY TO CONTACT ONLY THE SOLICITATION CONTRACTING OFFICE IN

body of the email or use MS Word, if submitting an attachment.  To ensure timely and accurate processing of inquiries, offerors are instructed
to put  “Questions for RFP 2009-N-11202” in the subject line of the email.  Submission of questions via email containing anything other than
what is listed exactly as stated above for the subject line could result in your questions not being answered due to misrouting.  Telephone
inquiries will not be accepted.
 
The Government’s response to all inquiries received, in accordance with this provision, will be posted to the FedBizOpps website at
http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ on or about 6/22/2008.
 
All inquiries shall be in writing, telephone inquiries will not be accepted.   No questions will be accepted after the inquiry due date
(6/18/2009).

M.2    Past Performance Evaluation (Adjectival Rating System) (Jan 2000)

Past performance information will be evaluated on offerors in the competitive range in the following manner:

(a)  Each offeror in the competitive range shall be evaluated on its past performance under current and prior contracts.  By past performance,
the Government means the offeror's record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the contractor's record of
forecasting and controlling costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules and terms, including the administrative aspects of performance;
the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business
like concern for the interest of the customer and the degree of quality of deliverables and performance.

(b)  Past performance will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall quality of the offeror's past performance will be
highly influential in determining the relative merits of the offeror's proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered the
most advantageous/best value to the Government.

(c)  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance for similar services relative to the size and complexity
of the procurement under consideration.

(d)  The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror's past performance based on collaborated past performance evaluations included in
the offerors proposal and/or other information obtained from references provided by the offeror, as well as other relevant past performance
information obtained from other sources known to the Government.  The Government may or may not survey all contracts listed by the offeror, and
reserves the right to perform customer surveys only for those contracts which are deemed by the Government to be most relevant to this
procurement.  The Customer/Client Survey Letter and the Past Performance Survey Document included as attachments under Section J will be used by
the Government to gather any required past performance evaluations.

(e)  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will
not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.

(f)  The assessment of the offerors past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and the other
competitors. Thus, an offeror with an exceptional record of  relevant past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than another
whose record is acceptable and/or less relevant, even though both may have acceptable technical and business proposals.

(g)  An offeror without a record of past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated
favorably or unfavorably.

(h)  Information provided by Offerors, as requested under Section L herein, relating to problems encountered on the identified contracts and the
Offeror’s corrective actions will be considered when unfavorable reports of past performance are received.  If award will be made without
conducting discussions, offerors may be given the opportunity clarify certain aspects of past performance information (e.g. relevance of an
offeror’s past performance information and averse past performance which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond).
Communications may be held with Offerors to obtain additional information regarding adverse past performance when required for making a
competitive range determination.   If discussions are held, offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past
performance.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.

(i)  Past performance will be evaluated for only those offerors remaining in the competitive range after completion of the review of the
business proposals and technical proposals.

(j)  Evaluation of past performance information will be reflected in terms of the following degrees of performance assessment:

Excellent:  A significant majority of the sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror’s performance was superior
and that they would unhesitatingly do business with the offeror again.  Complaints are negligible or unfounded.  The offeror has no record of
criminal conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old and the offeror has demonstrated by more recent performance that corrective
action has made the likelihood of such conduct in the future highly improbably.  No doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the
Government’s requirements as stated in the RFP.

Good:  Most sources of information state that the offeror’s performance was good, better than average, etc., and that they would willingly do
business with the offeror again.  Complaints, though perhaps well-founded, are few and relatively minor.  The offeror has no record of criminal
conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old and the offeror has demonstrated by more recent performance that corrective action has
made the likelihood of such conduct in the future highly improbable.  Little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the
Government’s requirements as stated in the RFP.

Neutral:  Either no past performance history exists for the corporation, predecessor companies, key personnel, or major/critical subcontractors,
or the offeror’s record of past performance was neither predominantly favorable nor unfavorable.  In the latter case, sources of information are
roughly divided over the quality of the offeror’s performance.  While some state that they would do business with the offeror again, others are
doubtful or would not.  Complaints are balanced by reports of good work.  The offeror has no record of criminal conduct, civil fraud, or
negligence, or the record is old.

Marginal:  Many sources of information made unfavorable reports about the offeror’s performance and either express serious doubts about doing
business with the offeror again or state that they would refuse to do so.  However, there are some favorable reports, and some sources of
information indicate that they would do business wit the offeror again.  There are many significant, serious, and well-founded complaints, but
there are some reports of very good performance.  The offeror may have been indicted, pled guilty, or may have been found guilty in matters of
criminal conduct, but the issues are either unresolved, relatively minor, or do not reflect a company-wide or managerial pattern of wrongdoing.
The offeror may have lost civil suits for fraud or negligence, but there is no company-wide or managerial pattern of fraudulent, negligent, or
criminal conduct.  Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government’s requirements as stated in the RFP.
Poor:  A significant majority of sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror’s performance was entirely
unsatisfactory and that they would not do business wit the offeror again under any circumstances. Customer complaints are substantial or
numerous and are well-founded. Or, although not debarred or suspended, the offeror is under indictment or has been convicted of criminal
conduct, or has been found civilly liable for fraud or negligence. The offeror either has presented no persuasive evidence of having taken
appropriate corrective action that will guard against such conduct in the foreseeable future, or it appears unlikely that the corrective action
will be effective. Serious doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government requirements as stated in the RFP.

M.3   Technical Strength More Important than Cost/Price (Jan 2000)

Offerors are advised that in proposal evaluation paramount consideration shall be given to technical proposals rather than to cost or price
unless, as a result of technical evaluations, proposals are judged to be essentially equal, in which case cost or price shall become the
determining factor. Furthermore, cost/price will be evaluated on the basis of cost realism which is defined as the offeror's ability to project
costs which are reasonable and indicate that the offeror understands the nature and extent of the work to be performed.

Discussions, if held, will be conducted only with those offerors determined to be within the competitive range.

Award shall be made to that responsible offeror submitting the proposal (Technical and Business) determined to be the most advantageous and the
best value to the Government as evaluated under the criteria described in this Section.

(End of Clause)


M.4  Evaluation of Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Factor (Jul 2000)

The Government will evaluate the Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Participation Plan for those offerors within the competitive range.
Offerors who are themselves SDB's should note that this evaluation factor will only be applied to those SDB offerors declining the price
evaluation adjustment for SDB concerns.  (See the provision entitled Price Evaluation Adjustment for Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns in
Section K and FAR 52.219-23).  If award is made without discussions, the factor will be evaluated for all offerors.

The evaluation of this factor will be based on information obtained from the plan provided by the offeror, sources of past performance
information (both those provided by the offeror and others identified by the Government), the realism of the plan (in terms of availability of
SDB's to perform the specific work involved), other relevant information obtained from SDB concerns, and any information supplied by the offeror
concerning problems encountered in SDB participation.

Evaluation of the SDB Participation Plan will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.   The
Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has demonstrated a commitment to use SDB concerns for the work for which it would be
responsible as the prime contractor.

The assessment of the offeror's SDB Participation Plan will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability and commitment of the
offeror and the other competitors.

Offers will be evaluated on the following sub-factors:

(a) The extent of an offeror's commitment to use SDB concerns.  Commitment should be as specific as possible, i.e., are subcontract arrangements
already in place, letters of commitment, etc.  Specific SDB concerns must be identified with points of contact and phone numbers.  Enforceable
commitments will be weighted more heavily than non-enforceable ones.  Targets expressed as dollars and percentage of total contract value for
each SDB participating will be incorporated into and become part of any resulting contract.  The extent of participation of all SDB concerns in
terms of the value of the total acquisition must be identified.

NOTE:  Targets expressed in dollars and percentages of total contract value will be judged on findings of technical merit and on findings that
the proposed costs are fair, reasonable and realistic.  Additional points or a higher rating will not be given simply for higher dollar or
percentages of work going to SDBs.

(b) The complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are proposed to perform.  Greater weight will be given for arrangements where the SDB
will be performing a greater variety of work and work of greater complexity.

(c) Past performance of the offeror in complying with subcontracting plans for SDB concerns.  An offeror with an exceptional record of
participation with SDB concerns will receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable.

(d) The following ratings are indicative of the point values that will be assigned to various levels of SDB involvement.  The actual scores
assigned may fall anywhere within the range of –10 to +10.

+10 Extensive SDB commitments for complex and varied work in the offeror’s SDB participation plan. Excellent record in complying with prior SDB
plans.

+05 Significant involvement of SDB’s in the offeror’s SDB participation plan. Successful record in complying with prior SDB plans.

0 Negligible participation of SDB’s. No past history.

-05 Some doubt exists the SDB’s will be involved in contract performance based upon information submitted.

-10 Serious doubt exists that SDB’s will be involved in contract performance based upon information submitted.  Evidence exists in prior non-
compliance with SDB goals.

   [1]  For purposes of computing per diem charges in lieu of actual subsistence charges, unless otherwise provided in the contract, a day is
   divided into four quarters that begin at 12 midnight, 6:00 AM, 12 noon, and 6:00 PM. For example, at an authorized per diem rate of $35.00 per
   day, a traveler who departed at 9:15 AM on July 15 and returned at 6:45 PM on July 18 would be entitled to $131.25.
