Exhibit 1
 Medical Exam and Consultative Opinion Ordering


The RRB contracts with two separate providers to: 1) schedule and provide results of medical exams ordered and 2) review the results of complex conditions to determine disability.

The following pages are provided to demonstrate to the proposer how the current FFS system accommodates medical exam and consultative opinion processing. Baseline FFS screens, modified screens showing the use of non-edited fields to store required data and 'keystroke emulation' screens depicting the actual view that staff uses when ordering and receiving are included. Payments are created by a nightly batch process after receivers are successfully accepted. The additional information required for 'ME' documents is passed to the medical exam vendor nightly to enable them to schedule exams and also provides data needed for various reports used to monitor the contract. The consultative opinions do not require additional data for the orders and no nightly file is created for that vendor. The opinion cost and all exam costs are defined in the vendor contracts by contract year and are updated in the RRB-created table each October 1
st .

The proposer is required to provide a solution that will allow staff, located both locally and in the field, to order/receive exams and opinions that are ordered for claimants and create the associated payments.

Please complete the RRB System Requirements using the instructions below. Submit the completed requirement responses in the same format in which you received them. Do not add or delete columns or requirements.

It is assumed that the service provider complies with all Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) mandatory requirements. The requirements matrices are therefore an extract of FSIO value added requirements that RRB prioritized as mandatory, modified FSIO mandatory requirements,  and RRB specific requirements. RRB specific additions in FSIO requirements are bolded.
The following legend describes the types of requirements in the matrices. Offerors shall not complete requirements for optional services they do not intend to provide.

The following table provides guidelines for columns that require vendor responses:
Column Column Heading Description
G Vendor Response: Solution Meets Requirement (Y, P, or N) Indicate whether or not the proposed solution meets (Y), partially meets (P) or does not meet (N) the requirement. 
RRB mandatory requirements indicate functionality the system must provide. RRB value added requirements indicate functionality the system should provide.

H Vendor Comments Mandatory Requirements- If the proposed solution does not meet a mandatory requirement, the offeror must specify how the gaps will be addressed. If the proposed solution partially meets a mandatory requirement, the offeror shall specify what is and is not satisfied by the solution and the gap-closing activities for the unsatisfied portions. Keep in mind that costs applicable to gap-closing activities shall be included in the pricing section of the Business Proposal. Additionally, indicate if the requirement will be satisfied in a future version, which version and the projected release date.
Value Added Requirements- The RRB does not require gap-closing activities for value added requirements. If the solution partially meets or does not meet a value added requirement, and the requirement will not be satisfied in a future version, the offeror shall enter ‘N/A.’ If the requirement will be satisfied in a future version, indicate what version and the projected release date. Keep in mind that there shall be no gap-closing activity costs for value added requirements in the pricing section of the Business Proposal.
The following legend provides a description of the rest of the columns:

RRB Financial System Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)
Purpose
The proposed Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) provides both the RRB and the successful offeror a scorecard permitting fair and equitable performance measurement over the life of the contract. While the QASP in and of itself is a direct measure of contractor deliverables and performance, it should also serve as an incentive-tool for contractor motivation and innovation. As a partner with the RRB, the successful offeror is expected to examine this plan carefully, and in its resultant offer, provide the RRB with recommended alternative approaches for incentivizing and maximizing performance. Those incentives can, and should be based on: meeting or exceeding schedule, improving and sustaining quality-control, exceeding labor-costs and ODC savings, and sustaining continuous product improvements.
The RRB also envisions periodic revisions of the QASP and the incentive formulae to ensure fairness throughout the performance of the contract. Those revisits are intended to occur within the first six (6) months of system go live, and then either semi-annually, at or before exercise of an option year, or as determined necessary by the RRB Contracting Officer. The RRB welcomes, and invites, vendor innovation and creativeness in assisting the RRB in improving the content and scope of the QASP.

                                           NOTIFICATION OF PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS


Background

Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors,
established a policy for all Federal agencies to create and use a government-wide secure and reliable form of identification for their Federal
employees and contractors. This policy is intended to ensure a more complete, reliable, and trusted identification of individuals and for
controlling the access of Federal employees and contractors to Federal physical facilities and information systems.

This notification is issued to applicants for employee and certain contractor positions with the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) to describe the
personal identity verification policies of this agency.


Applicant Identification Responsibilities

As an applicant for a position as an employee or contractor with the RRB, you are required to do the following in order to complete your
application process:
    • Appear in person before the appropriate RRB official and present two forms of identity source documents to prove your claimed identity.
      The identity source documents must be in original form and come from the list of acceptable documents shown below. At least one document
      shall be a valid State or Federal government issued picture identification (ID).
    • Complete and bring with you the enclosed Standard Form (SF) 85, OPM Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, or an equivalent form to
      provide the required background information; so that a background check can be completed, unless one was previously done, remains on file,
      and can be referenced. (For additional copies of this form go to http://www.opm.gov/forms.)
    • Submit to having your picture and fingerprints taken.

Once a background check has been completed, and no derogatory information is developed, you will be required to:
    • Appear in person to the authorized RRB official to collect your PIV (Personal Identity Verification) Card. At that time, you will again be
      required to present a state or Federal government picture identity source document to verify that you are the same individual as the one
      who applied for the employee or contractor position and submitted the identity information required under this policy.
    • Accept the PIV Card by signing for the card and acknowledging the related responsibilities.


Responsibilities of Holding a PIV Card

When you are issued a PIV Card, you have the following responsibilities regarding its care and protection. You will be asked to sign a statement
acknowledging your responsibilities. Some of the important responsibilities are:


    • You are required to protect your PIV Card from loss or theft. However, in the event that your card is lost or stolen, you must report the
      loss within 24 hours of noting its disappearance.
    • You agree that you will not attempt to clone, modify, or obtain data from any PIV Card.
    • You agree that you will not assist others in gaining unauthorized access to Federal facilities or information.


Protection of Applicant Information

The following information provided by you will be used as part of the process of identity proofing, registration/enrollment, conducting a
background investigation, and issuance of a PIV Card:
    • Applicant’s full name;
    • Date and place of birth;
    • Identity source documents; and
    • Other relevant information useful for proving the claimed identity of the applicant.

This information will be stored in secure electronic media or in locked files. Access to the records is limited to those individuals who have a
need to know the information in order to perform official functions under the PIV issuance process.


Notification of Results of Identity Proofing

If, as a result of the identity proofing process, you are deemed ineligible to be appointed to the position for which you applied and to be
issued an official RRB identity document, you will be notified in writing of the identity proofing results. You will also be notified at that
time of any additional rights you have under the RRB’s identity proofing processes.


Rights If PIV Card Is Not Approved for You

If you are denied a PIV Card, you have the right to appeal that decision Your appeal should start with a request to the Director of Human
Resources to review your case. [Note: If the position/contract you seek is in the Office of Inspector General (OIG), you should appeal to the
Assistant Inspector General for Investigations in the OIG.] Your request must be made within five workdays of receiving notification of the
denial, and should specify the basis for your belief that the decision to deny you a PIV Card was incorrect. If you are not satisfied with the
decision at this stage, you may make a further appeal to the Director of Administration [or the Inspector General in the case of a
position/contract in the OIG] within five workdays of receiving the decision at the initial stage of the appeal.


Correcting Incorrect Information

You have the right to present evidence to correct any information that you believe to be incorrect that is obtained about you as a result of the
PIV Card identity proofing, registration/enrollment, and issuance. Such evidence should be presented to the Director of Human Resources [or the
Assistant Inspector General for Investigations in the OIG for a position/contract in the OIG] as soon as you become aware of a decision being
made about you based on the incorrect information. A PIV Applicant Representative is available to assist you in removing incorrect


information from your records. The name of your PIV Applicant Representative is Pamela Martin-Tate. She can be reached at telephone number 312-
751-4943.

Privacy Rights
The information collected during the PIV process may be disclosed in accordance with the Railroad Retirement Board’s published routine uses as
stated in System of Records RRB-46 and RRB-48 and as otherwise permitted under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a), including disclosure:
to the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Federal Labor
Relations Authority upon an authorized request; to agencies, contractors, and others to administer personnel and payroll systems, for debt
collection and for employment or security investigations; to law enforcement agencies if the Railroad Retirement Board becomes aware of a
possible violation of a law or regulation; to a Congressional office in response to requests made on your behalf; to the Department of Justice,
courts, and counsel during litigation; to unions if needed to perform their authorized duties; to other agencies under approved computer
matches; and as otherwise authorized by law or regulations.


Violations of Privacy

Any person who knowing and willfully discloses information in violation of the Privacy Act is subject to civil, criminal and/or administrative
penalties.

Please contact the Bureau of Human Resources (312/751-4580) with any questions regarding the information contained in this notice.

1.0   Overview


1.1   Agency Information – The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is an independent Federal agency that administers a retirement and survivor
      benefits program for railroad employees and their families. The RRB was established by the Railroad Retirement Acts of 1937 and 1974. Its
      benefits program was the forerunner of the more familiar Social Security System. The Railroad Retirement System is unique inasmuch as it is
      the only federally administered benefits program covering a single private industry. The RRB also administers the Railroad Unemployment
      Insurance Act, which provides unemployment and sickness benefits to railroad employees. The RRB’s headquarters is located in Chicago,
      Illinois and has 52 local and field offices around the United States.


1.2   Performance-based Service Contracting Solicitation/Contract – This solicitation has been developed in response to the Office of Federal
      Procurement Policy (OFPP) policy to increase the use of performance-based contracting methods in the acquisition of services. Performance-
      based contracting aims to improve the value of contracting services by emphasizing objective, measurable mission-related outputs rather
      than how the work is performed or broad and imprecise statement of work. It requires objective, measurable performance requirements and
      quality standards in developing statements of work, selecting contractors, determining contract type and incentives, and performing
      contract administration.

1.3   Project Information – The RRB is seeking proposals from private and public sector offerors for the acquisition of an integrated financial
      system using a software as a service model, inclusive of but not limited to: implementation, migration, conversion and integration
      services; hosting and application management services; program management services, and operation and maintenance support services. The RRB
      intends to award on a best value basis an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract which the RRB will later issue fixed
      price and time and material delivery task orders against.

1.4   Post Award Conference – In order to codify any procedural issues and implement contract performance start up, a post award conference will
      be held at the RRB Headquarters Facility, 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60611-2092 or via a conference call. The contractor
      must attend this conference and be prepared to discuss startup. The contractor will be responsible for all costs related to attending this
      conference. It is anticipated that this conference will be held within 5 workdays after contract award.

   Statement of Work



      3.1   Project Title

      This solicitation is to obtain services to support the implementation of a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Core Federal Financial
      management system and interfaces from a shared service provider’s hosted environment for the RRB using a software as a service model. The
      RRB seeks to establish a contract that will provide a range of support for implementing and maintaining the financial management system.
      This initiative will be conducted in compliance with all applicable Federal financial systems regulations and guidance. Specific guidance
      is listed in Appendix A for further reference.


      The Financial Management Integrated System (FMIS) migration is led by the Bureau of Fiscal Operations (BFO) with support from Acquisitions
      Management (AM), and the Chief Information Officer (CIO).




      3.2   Background


            3.2.1.     General Information
           The RRB has operated a mainframe-based integrated core financial management system since October 1985. The original system (the
           Administrative Management Information System or AMIS) was developed by American Management Systems, Inc. (AMS) under contract with
           the RRB. In October 1988, RRB upgraded to the AMS’s Federal Financial System (FFS). The last and final major upgrade to FFS was made
           available in 1999 to make the system year 2000 compliant. The RRB continues to operate FFS under a maintenance agreement with CGI
           (formerly AMS); however, the system is no longer compliant under OMB Circular A-127 based on the following high level indicators:
               • Ability to produce financial statements and other required financial and budget reports using information generated by the
                 financial management system;
               • Preparation of reliable and timely financial information for managing current operations;
               • Ability to account for assets reliably, so that they can be properly protected from loss, misappropriation, or destruction; and
               • Adhere to Federal accounting standards and the U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL).

           As a result, the RRB recognizes that the system is nearing the end of its life cycle. With the implementation and migration to a new
           core financial system, the RRB will become substantially compliant with the Guidance from the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB)
           Circular A-127 which mandates the use of a core financial management system by a shared service or commercial provider. Further the
           shared service or commercial provider will have responsibility for technology hosting, as well as administration and application
           management from their data center.




           3.2.2 Current Environment
           The following describes the current RRB financial management configuration.
            • The core FFS system consists of budget execution, purchasing, accounts payable, automated disbursement and general ledger
              components.
            • Other components supplied by the system and in use include inventory (supplies) control and budget formulation. The budget
              formulation functionality is used by designated users to develop budgets, and by budget users to review, update and approve budget
              submissions. The system has business rules that enable users to determine workload costs and FTE usage attributable to the
              agency’s strategic goals.
            • A separate fixed assets system (Wisetrack) is used to maintain detailed records for capitalized and accountable assets.
              Transactions from Wisetrack are manually recorded into FFS.
            • A separate system is maintained for Cost Accounting functionality using data files from the FFS core system (non-labor) and the
              Payroll system (labor).
            • The general ledger component supports the preparation of the quarterly financial statements and SF-133 report on budget execution
              and budgetary resources and the annual Performance and Accountability Report.
            • Debt collection is managed through the Programs Accounts Receivable (PAR) system which produces files that are manually input into
              the FFS general ledger through a monthly bulk transaction. Over 25,000 new debts are established annually and collection
              activities from program annuitants are recorded in the PAR system. PAR receives and distributes debt and collection activities
              from multiple internal programs at the RRB. The PAR system is a RRB enhanced version of the FFS Accounts Receivable package
              modified to improve debt collection functionality and reporting. It is operated as a standalone system from the Core FFS system
              and maintains its own general ledger. The RRB would like to include this functionality into the new system’s AR module at a later
              date. See Optional Functionalities in Section 3.6.
            • Automated interfaces link the payroll and electronic travel systems to the financial system. The RRB is a client for the providers
              of these services which were mandated by previous eGov initiatives. The FFS system accepts financial data via secure data
              communication links from these two providers for accounting and disbursement purposes. The RRB will keep payroll services through
              GSA while considering e-travel services as an optional service in this request for proposals.
            • Additional functionality has been added to the procurement component of the financial system to support the requirements of the
              RRB disability program function to automatically order, approve and pay for contractor supplied medical examinations and
              consulting opinions. To accommodate this process, the RRB added 2 additional transactions by ‘cloning’ the commodity purchase
              order screens and processors. Several non-edited fields and the purchasing text table are used to hold specific data needed by the
              vendor (i.e., names, address, phone, complaint, urgency of request). A keystroke emulator allows infrequent users to correctly
              enter the detailed information required. Line number is used to indicate which exams need to be performed (an RRB table with
              line/exam number and current contract cost is used to default amounts and updated at the beginning of each contract year),
              accounting data is defaulted using an FFS table and vendor is defaulted by transaction type. Authorized RRB staff can enter an
              obligation for medical exams (approximately 250 employees) or consulting opinions (approximately 10 employees) into the system.
              After exam results or consulting opinions are accepted, RRB staff enters receiver documents (2 additional receiver transactions
              were added specific to each vendor).  A batch process creates payment vouchers nightly from these accepted receiver transactions.
              A comma delimited (CSV) file of detailed information is created for each obligation type nightly and downloaded by the vendors
              from a secure server.
            • RRB does not have an automated contracting system to process requirements, to develop solicitations, to maintain Federal
              Procurement Regulations or to produce SF-1449s, SF30s, and other relevant acquisition documents for contracts.
            • Administrative staff in the various RRB organizations have access to prepare budgets, submit purchase requisitions, and review
              other financial information pertaining to their organizations. Other financial transactions, including budget reprogramming,
              journal vouchers, payment vouchers and purchase orders, are prepared by specially trained staff in the Office of the Chief
              Financial Officer and contract specialist staff in the RRB’s procurement organization.
            • System data is routinely transferred to a local area network (LAN) environment for processing by other software applications
              (spreadsheets and databases) to support the organization’s data reporting and analysis requirements.
            • A system administrator at RRB oversees maintenance and enhancements to the system in addition to establishing security access and
              monitoring both scheduled and unscheduled processing and reporting. The RRB will, however, comply with the security access
              procedures of its successful offeror  but expects oversight on the level of access its staff has to the system.
            • Current environments include production and test.
            • Production environment consists of current and previous five (5) years’ production data, including both open and closed
              transactions.
            • The data for both the production and test environments for FFS is contained on less than two IBM 3390-9 direct access storage
              devices.
            • The RRB staff totals 953 with 415 system users.  The RRB operates from 56 locations which includes its headquarters (Chicago, IL),
              the Office of Legislative Affairs (Washington, DC), the Office of the Inspector General (Philadelphia, PA), and 53 field offices.
              See Appendix B for the FFS Environment Profile.





      3.3   Goals and Objectives


      The primary goal of the RRB is to procure a fully integrated and automated financial management system that focuses on the agency’s mission
      and accountability from a service provider. The system must (1) achieve compliance with RRB applicable laws, regulations, standards, and
      requirements as provided in Appendix A; (2) improve and facilitate user access to financial information through online inquiries and
      reporting tools; (3) reduce redundancy in data entry, storage, and processing; (4) improve security, control and disaster recovery
      capability; and (5) reduce manual intensive business processes. The implemented system should be a hybrid that facilitates transaction
      processing to supplement the workload of existing staff with detailed analysis while supporting continuous improvements in operational
      efficiencies.


      3.4   Future State System


      The RRB intends to procure and implement a COTS federal financial management system with key interfaces in a hosted shared service
      environment. The system shall be compliant with requirements in OMB Circular A-127 for Federal financial management systems, and compliant
      with the Federal Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR) developed by the former Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) and
      the former Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP). In addition, the service provider shall comply with A-127 requirements
      for service providers, including meeting requirements for the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), Section 508 of
      the Rehabilitation Act, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996; meeting the requirements of the Financial Management Due
      Diligence Checklist, and provide a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 16 audit report annually to its customers.


      The RRB is prepared to modify their processes in order to mirror the financial industry best practices and maximize the greatest benefit of
      the system. While some configuration may be necessary in order to accommodate unique RRB requirements, customization of the system will not
      be considered. The selected solution will include functionality for budget formulation and execution, procurement, payment management and
      disbursement, accounts receivable, general ledger posting and maintenance, closing and clearing and report preparation. The system shall
      also include interfaces for payroll and e-travel. Special attention should be given to the medical exam and medical consulting opinion
      obligation and payment functionality.


      The RRB is interested in implementing integrated functionality for fixed assets, railroad employer accounts receivable, e-travel and debt
      collection. While these modules are desired, they will be considered as optional software services and be evaluated to determine the best
      approach for the RRB. The RRB is interested in optional hosted services as described in section 3.11 below and should be described and
      incorporated as optional hosting services.


The chart below provides the RRB future state vision.

The mandatory components for the shared service solution are listed below by business area:


      3.5   Mandatory Functionalities


           3.5.1 Budget Formulation and Execution
           The service provider will include a module for budget formulation that allows for the application, update, and maintenance of one or
           more versions of budget plans, guidance, ground rules or assumptions and uses the assumptions to develop budgetary alternatives for
           decision making purposes. The budget execution module shall allow for the initiation, monitoring and analysis of the agency’s budget,
           including ability to load appropriations and allotments, provide status of funds reports and automatic funds control. Ideally, the
           system will provide the ability to spread targets across the budget lines and accept an uploaded file from the payroll system for
           real time, transaction driven FTE analysis. The RRB seeks better tracking of cost savings and efficiencies as well as reporting
           capabilities that allow for extraction of data for purposes of compiling reports such as budget object classification (BOC) code
           variances, fixed versus variable costs, work years in personnel costs, and international costs of overseas transactions.

           3.5.2   General Ledger
           The RRB requires that the system provides a General Ledger that will facilitate accurate and timely posting of transactions, provides
           integrated functionality with subledgers, and provides robust reporting capabilities. The system shall have the capability to provide
           the SF 133, SF 224, standard financial statements, other agency specific reports, in addition to other OMB and Treasury required
           reports and data extracts. The current system accounting structure includes Fund, Budget, Fiscal Year, USSGL, Organization, and a
           shared field for Budget Object Code or Revenue Source. If the offeror’s solution requires additional elements they will need to be
           built out during the implementation. In addition, the service provider shall provide functionality that will meet Government-wide
           Accounting (GWA) requirements by the Treasury cutover date. Multiple general and trust funds, see appendix E, accounts are currently
           maintained by RRB staff and included in bulk file and financial statement reporting.

           3.5.3   Medical Exams and Consulting Opinions
           As part of its mission to provide stewardship and administer the retirement and survivor benefit program for railroad employees and
           their families, the RRB handles disability claims.  To review these claims, the agency has claimants undergo medical exams to
           determine whether the extent of their impairments qualify for disability.  The RRB has a vendor that selects doctors and schedules
           the exams and a separate vendor that refers complex cases to medical consultants for their opinions.  The current system provides
           requisitioners limited inputs in order to facilitate the ordering and receiving of exams and opinions.  The configuration of those
           screens and data required are presented in Exhibit 1.

           As part of the new system, the RRB will need to track the time between placement of the order, receipt at the agency and acceptance
           of exam results.  Reports of timeliness of each exam, counts of open/closed by month and contract year, reason for any late results
           or acceptance of results are required by the RRB.


           3.5.4   Procurement
           The system shall provide tools to facilitate acquisition and contract administration and meet the requirements of the Federal
           Acquisition Regulations (FAR) as well as RRB’s requirements. Specifically, it shall include functionality for Requirements
           Definition, Acquisition Planning, Synopsis & Solicitation, Screening & Evaluation, Awards, Contract Administration, and Contract
           Closeout. In addition, it shall include a database of the current FAR clauses. The system shall also interface with Federal
           Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG).


           3.5.5   Accounts Payable
           The system shall provide standard federal accounts payable functionality, including functionality for Treasury initiatives such as
           the Payment Application Modernization within Treasury cutover requirements. In addition, the system will allow the RRB the ability to
           receive invoices electronically and provide invoice approval routing for invoices received either electronically or entered manually.




           3.5.6   Accounts Receivable
           The system shall provide standard Federal accounts receivable functionality, consistent with requirements in the FFMSR. The system
           will be used to process administrative Accounts Receivable upon implementation. The system should be scalable and able to accommodate
           the debt collection requirements post implementation of the core system, for the migration of data from the existing PAR system.

           3.5.7   Reporting
           The system shall provide various types of reporting tools, including COTS standard parameter based reports and business
           intelligence/reporting tools to support RRB specific parameter based reports and ad-hoc reporting capabilities. The business
           intelligence/reporting tool shall have the ability to produce reports containing data from any system module supported by the service
           provider, as well as some RRB hosted systems. The contractor shall provide the ability for the RRB to perform custom report
           development both during and post migration to the new system and maintain a separate data warehouse for reporting purposes. A list of
           RRB required reports is included in Appendix C.


           3.5.8   General Requirements
           FMIS will allow the RRB to comply with Government-Wide Accounting initiatives by demonstrating the following capabilities:
               • Provide a Core Financial management system that is compliant with Federal Financial System requirements;

               • Comply with RRB-specific requirements for the COTS shared services solution;
               • Comply with federal and RRB specific system and security requirements.

           Additionally, the contractor must describe how data is updated and maintained, specifically identifying the responsibilities of the
           vendor and RRB for maintaining and updating vendor files, system access, chart of accounts, and all other data that would be
           referenced and used by the RRB. The offeror shall also describe the method for transitioning data back in house or to another
           provider, on demand or in the case of contract termination for any reason.


      3.6   Optional Functionalities


           3.6.1   Fixed Assets
           The solution shall maintain physical accountability over personal property and equipment acquired separately but consolidated to
           represent one item, or items purchased in bulk, whose acquisition or fair market values meet RRB capitalization thresholds.
           Additionally, controlled personal property and equipment that is expensed when acquired will need to be recorded and maintained for
           accountability and management. The system must maintain information on property from the time the RRB takes title to or possession of
           property through disposal and maintain a complete history of modifications and improvements. The current system houses close to 115
           depreciable and 6,300 non-depreciable items valued at nearly $2.5 million and $670,000, respectively.


           3.6.2   eGov Travel
           The RRB currently contracts the following travel services:
               • eGov Travel Services (eTS) Reservation and Fulfillment Services
               • eTS Authorization and Voucher Services
               • Paper Ticket Issuance and Delivery
               • Standard Implementation Services; Service Level A, per the GSA Master Contract
               • Receipt Imaging
               • Supplemental Customer Support Services, per the GSA Master Contract
               • Supplemental Training Services, per the GSA Master Contract
               • Custom Report Development
           The vendor shall provide travel services as provided in the U.S. General Services Administration E2 travel Master Contract
           requirements.



           3.6.3   Employer Contribution Receivable
           The RRB monitors payments from the railroad companies to the benefit trusts and reconciles the money paid quarterly. In the event of
           under payment by the railroads to the trust funds, the RRB records an employer receivable and initiates collection proceedings. The
           system shall provide accounts receivable functionality for managing employer receivables consistent with requirements in the FFMSR
           and identified by individual railroad companies.






           3.6.4   Debt Collection
           Debt is created when a benefit has been overpaid. Overpayments result from a recalculation, the death of an annuitant, employer
           settlements that overlap receipt of sickness benefits, as well as an increase in the amount of Social Security an annuitant receives
           which requires a decrease in the annuity payment. The debt may be the responsibility of the former railroad employee or their
           beneficiary. The RRB is responsible for managing money due to the RRB for benefits paid in excess of the amount due to a recipient.
           The system shall provide debt collection functionality for recording, collecting and adjusting debts related to the overpayment of
           benefits. Several RRB legacy databases, applications and programs interface with the accounts receivable system. The RRB is
           responsible for building the files from those programs into the new financial system. Functionality to replace the PAR system is
           considered value-added within the new system’s receivable management module. Requirements are presented as debt collection in
           attachment 1 with full migration from PAR into the FMIS post implementation and migration of the core financial system. Appendix F
           describes the legacy systems that shares information with the debt collection system.


      A list of RRB mandatory and value-added system requirements is included in Attachment 1.  This list is intended to compliment the Federal
      Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR) developed by the former Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) and the former Joint
      Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) that must be included in the proposed solution.


      3.7   Services

      Offerors must provide services related to hardware/server space, software, implementation, integration, hosting and application management.
      Although a detailed approach format is included in the following sections, offerors are expected to propose the best methodology and
      solution, and are encouraged to provide innovative ideas to meet the needs of the RRB.


      3.8   Software

            3.8.1 Software Services
           The system must provide the following mandatory software services: budget planning/formulation and execution, general ledger,
           procurement, accounts payable, accounts receivable, and reporting modules that are compliant with the FFMSR. In addition, the RRB
           requests offerors to include the following optional software services: fixed assets, employer contribution receivable, and debt
           collection. The selected vendor must provide environments to include full time production and test, as well as training pre and post
           migration and a development environment during the implementation. Detailed descriptions of these software services are described in
           Section 3.4: Future State System and in Attachment 1: RRB System Requirements.






           3.8.2       Interfaces
           Key interfaces to be provided in the Core Financial system are included in the system requirements. The general interface environment
           is described below:

            • RRB has a System Oriented Architecture which is driven by its business processes. Due to the nature of RRB business functions,
              which is dictated by legislation, flexibility is imperative and central for the success of RRB. Potential vendors need to offer
              solutions that can be easily adapted to meet future additional interface requirements. The optimal solution shall allow for data
              transfer in real time. There are 3 automated interfaces, 2 with existing shared service providers and the other is managed in-
              house. Additionally, automated batch interfaces are planned with the RRB’s program benefit systems.

            • Cost Accounting – This is an out-bound fixed length text file from the RRB cost accounting application containing non payroll
              costs currently from FFS.

            • U.S. Treasury – This is an in-bound interface from the Treasury Reporting System (TRS) for updates to the general ledger with SF-
              224 data. FMIS should also be interfaced with Secure Payment System (SPS), GTAS and Governmentwide Accounting and Reporting
              Program (GWA).

            • FPDS-NG – This external interface is to report procurement data to comply with federal transparency initiatives.

            • GSA Payroll – This is an external in-bound (secure FTP between GSA and RRB) interface with data flow into FFS. A biweekly job
              kicks-off the batch upload process which updates financial data and GL with the GSA payroll expense data. A monthly job kicks-off
              the batch upload process which updates financial data and the general ledger. Payment vouchers are created for transit benefit
              parking reimbursements to eligible RRB staff and reports are generated to support agency-wide purchases of commuter transit passes
              and fare cards for eligible staff (details maintained on RRB table). The RRB’s transit benefit processing is unique in that it
              takes the form of pre-tax deductions, not a direct benefit from the agency.

            • eGov Travel – Currently there is a secure FTP connection between RRB and CWT SatoTravel that provides data related to travel
              authorization and voucher approvals required daily for the FFS system to obligate and disburse travel payments. Payment
              notifications and authorization acceptance files are also supplied to CWT SatoTravel daily through the interface. The eGov Travel
              solution could either be an interface to the RRB’s vendor or through the offeror if the optional e-Travel service as specified in
              the U.S. General Services Administration E2 travel Master Contract, is included in the offeror’s proposal and the optional task is
              awarded.

            • Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA) Award and RR Retirement Act Award Processing – RRB does not currently have an automated
              interface with this system, and is recording summarized data manually into FFS through a summarized transaction performed monthly.
              The RRB will be responsible for developing the required data files from the benefits system but providing automated interface
              functionality with this system is a Mandatory key requirement. The system will need to accept an inbound interface of summarized
              transactions to the General Ledger from RRB’s (highly customized) Benefits Payment system – the key business function of RRB.

            • Program Accounts Receivable (PAR) – In the event that an offeror does not choose to propose on the optional debt collection
              functionality, a PAR interface shall be developed. RRB does not currently have an automated interface with this system, and is
              recording summarized data manually into FFS. The RRB will be responsible for developing the required data files from the benefits
              system but providing automated batch interface functionality with this system is a Mandatory key requirement. The interface with
              the PAR system would be inbound only to feed summarized accounts receivable balances to the General Ledger from this subsidiary
              ledger.



   3.9      Proposed Project Approach and Implementation Methodology (Mandatory Service)

   Offerors must provide a detailed project plan and methodology that clearly demonstrates how their team will initiate and meet the stated goals

3.11  Optional Hosted Services

      The RRB sees the implementation of FMIS as a new paradigm for its business operations. New interfaces between RRB systems will create an
      increased number of transactions to be processed in the financial system. In addition, the internal controls that will be included in the
      system will create the need for additional analysis, error correction, and place workload on business areas that do not exist in the
      current system.  This increased workload will require the RRB to manage its existing staff wisely and may require it to strategically
      supplement its resources through the provider. Potential areas the RRB may require support in the future include support for the management
      of accounts payable and disbursements, support for the management of administrative accounts receivable, and support to produce the
      monthly, quarterly and annual financial statement preparation as optional hosted services. Additionally, bulk file support and agency
      specific analyses activities may also be performed by the provider. The current list of standard reports is included in Appendix C.



3.12  Mandatory and Optional Requirements

            The RRB requires information and pricing on all mandatory and optional functionalities and services.  Below is a summary of those
      mandatory and optional functionalities and services pursuant to this statement of work.
|                                                                                                                        |

      3.15  Location and Manner of Performance



           The RRB will provide the contractor space at the RRB headquarters facility located at 844 N. Rush St., Chicago, IL and access to
           personnel as deemed necessary by approved project plan during performance of the contract. Vendor is prohibited from connecting
           laptops to the RRB network. The RRB will provide the contractor’s staff appropriate office space and connectivity to all applicable
           systems when performing tasks on-site at the RRB headquarters.


           The Contractor shall ensure the privacy, confidentiality, and safety of RRB data and files and shall not alter, copy or otherwise
           damage data and file material.


           The Contractor shall designate a primary contract liaison, and an alternate, to coordinate activities, resolve day-to-day problems,
           and answer questions from RRB staff. The contract liaison will be available during RRB core business hours of 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
           central time.


           If the Contractor provides such services on-site, service may be performed during the hours of 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. central time.
           The work schedule may be modified as approved in advance by the COR. Office space, equipment and supplies will be furnished by the
           RRB for on-site services only. If services are performed off-site, the RRB reserves the right to perform inspection of off-site
           facility.



      3.16  Travel



           The RRB will reimburse the contractor for allowable travel approved by the Contracting Officer and COR in advance of trips taken in
           the performance of time and material task orders issued against the IDIQ contract as stated in section 2.1, Other Direct Costs, with
           the Price Schedule section of the RFP. Travel expenses incurred during performance of fixed price task orders against the IDIQ
           contract are at the vendor’s discretion and therefore not reimbursable by the RRB.



      3.17  Security Compliance Requirements



           The offeror shall comply with the information technology security requirements in the Federal Information Security Management Act,
           the related National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) FISMA implementation guidance, including but not limited to NIST
           800-37 Rev. 1, NIST 800-53 Rev. 3 and NIST 800-53A, and OMB memoranda on privacy and security. The proposal shall include a list of
           proposed staff for these services that have successfully met requirements in the Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-
           12), OMB guidance M-05-24 and M-11-11, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201 through other
           Federal Government Agencies. Additional security provisions are provided in the Clauses and Provisions Section of the RFP.


           The proposed solution is required to meet all security controls for a FISMA moderate system as defined by NIST 800-53, regardless of
           whether or not each requirement is specified in this solicitation. The offeror shall comply with NIST 800-53 Rev. 3, including, but
           not limited to, indicating compliance with the requirement for use of multifactor authentication for network access to privileged
           accounts (Organizational Users IA-2(2)). RRB requires at minimum two factor authentication. In the proposal, the use of Personal
           Identity Verification (PIV) authentication is the preferred method of multifactor authentication, but the use of other multifactor
           protocols will be acceptable for authenticating system administrators (e.g., passwords, tokens, biometrics, and PIV authentication).



      3.18  Disaster Recovery Requirements



           The Contractor shall develop and deliver draft and final versions of a Disaster Recovery Plan per the deliverable schedule in section
           3.13. The Contractor shall, at a minimum:
               • Describe the strategy and services required to preserve and restore essential functions of the financial management system as
                 well as describe the strategy and services required to restore full functionality;
               • Ensure the Disaster Recovery Site is in a different geographical location (within the continental United States) and building
                 than the primary site;
               • Test the plan periodically based on best practices.





      3.19  PIV Cards


           Consistent with the OMB Memorandum M-11-11 which addressed implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, the RRB’s
           systems will use PIV credentials in accordance with NIST guidelines. The contractor shall insure the financial system is compliant
           with Federal policy, standards and supporting technical specifications and is enabled to use PIV credentials.


           As stated in Section 3.16 Security Compliance Requirements, contractors must at minimum comply with two factor authentication, with
           preference for use of HSPD-12/PIV cards. In addition, the RRB will perform a background investigation on all staff from the offeror
           awarded a contract from this solicitation, in accordance with this requirement.


      3.20  Tentative Deployment Schedule


           The below is a tentative deployment schedule. Offerors shall identify the interim steps, with completion dates, between the project
           kickoff and the go live date.

            (a) The offeror shall provide documentation that the Cognizant Federal Agency has determined that the proposed EVMS complies with the
           EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA Standard - 748 (current version at time of solicitation).
           (b) If the offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a)
           of this provision, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan for compliance with the EVMS guidelines.
              (1) The plan shall—
                 (i) Describe the EVMS the offeror intends to use in performance of the contracts;
                 (ii) Distinguish between the offeror’s existing management system and modifications proposed to meet the guidelines;
                 (iii) Describe the management system and its application in terms of the EVMS guidelines;
                 (iv) Describe the proposed procedure for administration of the guidelines, as applied to subcontractors; and

             (2) The offeror shall provide information and assistance as required by the Contracting  Officer to support review of the plan.
             (3) The Government will review and approve the offeror’s plan for an EVMS before contract award.

           guidelines.
           (d) The Government will conduct an IBR, as designated by the agency, prior to contract award. The objective of the IBR is for the
           Government and the Contractor to jointly assess technical areas, such as the Contractor’s planning, to ensure complete coverage of
           the contract requirements, logical scheduling of the work activities, adequate resources, methodologies for earned value (budgeted
           cost for work performed (BCWP)), and identification of inherent risks.



      4.4   Earned Value Management System (JULY 2006) FAR 52.234-4

           (a) The Contractor shall use an EVMS that has been determined by the Cognizant Federal Agency (CFA) to be compliant with the
           guidelines in ANSI/EIA Standard - 748 (current version at the time of award) to manage this contract. If the Contractor’s current
           EVMS has not been determined compliant at the time of award, see paragraph (b) of this clause. The Contractor shall submit reports in
           accordance with the requirements of this contract.
           (b) If, at the time of award, the Contractor’s EVM System has not been determined by the CFA as complying with EVMS guidelines or the
           Contractor does not have an existing cost/schedule control system that is compliant with the guidelines in ANSI/EIA Standard - 748
           (current version at time of award), the Contractor shall—

           (c) The Government will conduct an Integrated Baseline Review (IBR). If a pre-award IBR has not been conducted, a post award IBR
           shall be conducted as early as practicable after contract award.

               (1) Exercise of significant options; or
               (2) Incorporation of major modifications.
           (e) Unless a waiver is granted by the CFA, Contractor proposed EVMS changes require approval of the CFA prior to implementation. The
           CFA will advise the Contractor of the acceptability of such changes within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of proposed

           to the CFA at least 14 calendar days prior to the effective date of implementation.
           (f) The Contractor shall provide access to all pertinent records and data requested by the Contracting Officer or a duly authorized
           representative as necessary to permit Government surveillance to ensure that the EVMS conforms, and continues to conform, with the
           performance criteria referenced in paragraph (a) of this clause.
           (g) The Contractor shall require the subcontractors specified below to comply with the requirements of this clause: [Insert list of
           applicable subcontractors.]

           (d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the
           Contractor within the time specified in the order. The contract shall govern the Contractor’s and Government’s rights and obligations

           expiration of the contract; provided, that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend
           at least  60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.
           (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.
           (c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed seven years.

      4.8   Availability of Funds (APR 1984) FAR 52.232-18


           Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the
           availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the

      4.9   Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year (APR 1984) FAR 52.232-19


           Funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond September 30th. The Government’s obligation for
           performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for
           contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this
           contract beyond September 30th, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor
           receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

      4.10  Technical Direction


           Performance of the work under this contract shall be subject to the technical direction of the Contracting Officer Representative
           (COR). The term “technical direction” is defined to comprise the following:


                 (a) Directions to the contractor which redirect the contract effort, shift work emphasis between work areas or tasks, require
                 pursuit of certain lines of inquiry, fill in details or otherwise serve to accomplish the contractual statement of work.


                 (b) Provisions of information to the contractor which assists in the interpretation of drawings, specifications or technical
                 portions of the work description.

                 be delivered by the Contractor to the Government under this contract.


                 (d) Technical directions must be within the general scope of work stated in the contract. The COR does not have the authority to
                 and may not issue any directions which (1) constitutes an assignment of additional work outside the general scope of the
                 contract; (2) constitutes a change as defined in the contract article entitled “Changes”; (3) in any manner causes an increase
                 or decrease in the estimated cost or the time required for contract performance; or (4) changes any of the expressed terms,
                 conditions, or specifications of the contract.


                 The Contractor shall proceed promptly with the performance of technical directions duly issued by the COR in the manner
                 prescribed by this Section and within his authority under the provisions of this Section.  If, in the opinion of the Contractor,
                 any instruction or direction issued by the COR is within one of the categories as defined in (1) through (4) above, the
                 Contractor shall not proceed but shall notify the Contracting Officer within five (5) working days after receipt of any such
                 instruction or direction and shall request the Contracting Officer to modify the contract accordingly.  Upon receiving such
                 notification from the Contractor, the Contracting Officer shall issue an appropriate contract modification or advise the
                 Contractor in writing that, in his opinion, the technical direction is within the scope of this Section and does not constitute
                 a change under the Changes article of the contract.  The Contractor shall thereupon proceed immediately with the direction
                 given.  A failure of the parties to agree upon the nature of the instruction or direction or upon the contract action to be
                 taken with respect thereto shall be subject to the provisions of the contract article entitled “Disputes.”

      4.14    Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (APR 2010) FAR 52.209-5

            a.1. The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-
                  (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals—
                    (A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of
                    contracts by any Federal agency;
                    (B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment
                    rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or
                    performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes
                    relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction
                    of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if
                    offeror checks “have,” the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);
                   (C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with,
                   commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
                   (D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in
                   an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
                     (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
                        (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is
                        not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to
                        the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
                        (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax
                        liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action
                        is precluded.
                     (2) Examples.
                       (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek
                       Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.
                       Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all
                       judicial appeal rights.
                       (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been
                       issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting
                       the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course
                       of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior
                       opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the
                       taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial
                       appeal rights.
                        (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely
                        payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not
                        currently required to make full payment.
                        (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action
                        is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
                  (ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated
                  for default by any Federal agency.
                  (2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary
                  management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division
                  or business segment; and similar positions).

                  This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False,
                  Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States
                  Code.

               (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the
               Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
               (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of
               an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the
               Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by
               the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
               (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in
               good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not
               required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
               (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when
               making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other
               remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for
               default.

                 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules).
           “Principal” means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within
           a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).
           (b) The offeror [ ] has [ ] does not have current active Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000.
           (c) If the offeror checked “has” in paragraph (b) of this provision, the offeror
           represents, by submission of this offer, that the information it has entered in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity
           Information System (FAPIIS) is current, accurate, and complete as of the date of submission of this offer with regard to the

                       reimbursement, restitution, or damages of $5,000 or more.
                       (iii) In an administrative proceeding, a finding of fault and liability that results in—
                        (A) The payment of a monetary fine or penalty of $5,000 or more; or
                        (B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000.

                 some of the information posted to the non-public segment of FAPIIS is covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of
                 Information Act, the Government official who posted the information must within 7 calendar days remove the posting from FAPIIS
                 and resolve the issue in accordance with agency Freedom of Information procedures, prior to reposting the releasable
                 information. The contractor must cite 52.209-9 and request removal within 7 calendar days of the posting to FAPIIS.
                 (2) The Contractor will also have an opportunity to post comments regarding information that has been posted by the Government.
                 The comments will be retained as long as the associated information is retained, i.e., for a total period of 6 years. Contractor
                 comments will remain a part of the record unless the Contractor revises them.
                 (3) As required by section 3010 of Pub. L. 111-212, all information posted in FAPIIS on or after April 15, 2011, except past

6.0   Evaluation Criteria


The RRB will consider all responsive bids as part of its best value determination. The order of importance for the evaluation criteria is as
follows: Technical/Management Approaches, Past Performance, and Cost. Should a Federal SSP be selected RRB will enter into an intergovernmental
agreement. The RRB reserves the right to award without further discussions on the original submission of technical and cost information. As
discussed above,  offerors are instructed to provide complete technical proposal data, and commensurate prices/pricing in support of Mandatory
CLINS one (1) thru three (3), and Optional CLINS four (4) thru twelve (12).  Failure to comply completely with this requirement will render an
offerors proposal in non-conformance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation, and the proposal will not be considered for further
evaluation.  Offerors should ensure accuracy and completeness in their initial proposal submission. Initial evaluation scores will be developed
from a review of written proposals based on the following criteria:

     I. Technical/Management Approach



        a. Software – The RRB will evaluate the proposed financial management solution’s ability to meet the mandatory and value-added
           requirements based on information provided in Attachment 1. The RRB will evaluate software demonstrations/presentations of those
           vendors determined to be in the competitive range. Further, the RRB will evaluate the offeror’s proposed approach for automated data
           sharing and interface integrations with external providers, RRB programs and applications.



        b. Implementation and Migration – The RRB will evaluate the degree to which the offeror identifies major tasks and resources required to
           implement the proposed solution, conveys an understanding of the management and technical complexities of the migration effort, and
           defines a clear approach to minimize risk.


           The RRB will evaluate the offeror’s problem resolution plan and overall client support operations. The RRB considers sustainment and
           recovery of total system functionality to be extremely important.




           The RRB will evaluate responses with consideration of a sound comprehensive approach to manage the services to be delivered and a
           sound comprehensive approach to manage the migration of existing services to the contractor’s product. The RRB will evaluate training
           materials and proposed training delivery.




           The RRB will evaluate key management and technical experts, identified for both implementation and post implementation services, with
           experience managing and leading similar projects.


        c. Hosting and Application Services – The RRB will evaluate the offeror’s ability to host, operate, and maintain their proposed
           solution. The evaluation will consider the offeror’s proposed application hosting environment, technical support, ongoing operations,
           maintenance and security. The RRB will evaluate the offeror’s ability to provide optional services, including but not limited to,
           supplemental services and report preparation.



           The RRB will evaluate the offeror’s problem resolution plan and overall client support operations. The RRB considers sustainment and
           recovery of total system functionality to be extremely important.


           The RRB will evaluate the offeror’s performance measurement approach, including the proposed approach to earned value management
           (EVM) and quality assurance, to assess its ability to successfully manage the technical and financial aspects of implementation and
           migration. The RRB will also evaluate the offeror’s post implementation service level agreements, to assess its ability to
           successfully manage the technical aspects of the project.




           The RRB will evaluate key management and technical experts, identified for both implementation and post implementation services, with
           experience managing and leading similar projects.




    II. Past Performance – The RRB will evaluate the offeror’s past performance for 1) system implementation and 2) hosting and application
        services to determine the degree to which the past performance demonstrates the offeror's ability to successfully perform the
        requirements of this SOW. It is highly desired that the offeror demonstrate a record of relevant past performance with Federal agencies
        of similar size, performance and transaction volumes to the RRB. The RRB may contact, as appropriate, any one or all of the five,
        federal agency or other public sector references responding to the PPQ, as federal agency past performance/references will receive
        higher weighting/rating than other sources.



   III. Cost – The RRB will use cost/price proposals in determining the best value and therefore offeror’s initial offer should contain the best
        terms. The offeror’s pricing proposal must be clear on the services/options included in their offer and their associated pricing.




   6.1            Initial Evaluation to Determine Competitive Range




   The RRB shall perform an intial evaluation as stated above to determine which proposals are considered to be responsive and appear to meet the
   mandatory and optional FMIS requirements. Offerors are instructed to provide complete technical proposal data, and commensurate prices/pricing
   in support of Mandatory CLINS one (1) thru three (3), and Optional CLINS four (4) thru twelve (12).  Failure to comply completely with this
   requirement will render an offerors proposal in non-conformance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation, and the proposal will not
   be considered for further evaluation. The Contracting Officer will determine which proposals should be included in the competitive range based
   on the initial technical and business evaluation conducted by the RRB evaluation team. Offerors whose proposals are determined to be
   nonresponsive or are not selected for the competive range will be notified in writing by the RRB as soon as possible after the competitive
   range determination has been made.


   6.2            Competitive Range Evaluation

   Those offerors whose proposals have been determined to be in the competitive range will be notified as soon as possible by the RRB once the
   decision has been made by the CO. The offerors in the competitive range will be requested to provide a system demonstration and oral
   presentation covering specific functionalities and requirements of FMIS. The offerors will also be given the opportunity to respond to
   additional questions from the RRB evaluation team regarding their offered solution to meet the FMIS requirements as well as submit a Final
   Proposal Revision addressing associated changes to their business or technical proposals based on the RRB’s questions. The RRB evaluation team
   will evaluate the system demonstration, oral presentation and FPR submitted by the offerors to determine which offeror’s proposal best meets
   the requirements for FMIS.


   6.3      General Evaluation and Award Information

      a.    To be considered responsive to this requirement, the offeror must comply with the format and content specified. Offerors whose
        proposals are deemed deficient in this regard may be permitted, at the RRB’s discretion, to remedy the deficiency by submitting
        additional clarifying or supplemental information.


      b.   Proposals will be first reviewed for content conformance to proposal preparation
        instructions. Proposals which are so deficient in these areas as to not warrant further consideration will be rejected and the offeror
        will be so notified.

      c.   Responsive proposals will be evaluated to determine the relative technical merit of
        each response. Accordingly, the objective of this technical evaluation is to measure the extent to which proposals meet the requirements
        as stated in the Statement of Work.




      d.   The Government will evaluate the proposals received and award a contract, subject to
        the availability of funds, to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is the Best Value to the Government,
        price and other factors (including Technical/Management Approach, Past Performance, and value-added characteristics) considered.
           NOTE:    In conducting an impartial and comprehensive price evaluation to determine fair and reasonable prices, the Government may
           apply various price analysis techniques to confirm the validity of prices proposed, including the application of price
           reasonableness, price realism, and best value judgment.

                                                  Appendix F – Debt Collection Dependent Systems


The following describes the RRB legacy databases, applications and programs which interface with PAR under the current business process.

ASTRO (The Automated System to Recover Overpayments) mechanically initiates batch file transactions to DAISY to adjust, suspend or reinstate
benefit payments. ASTRO reads the PAR database to monitor debt balances, validate debt information and update several PAR tables to reflect
collection status and due process information.

RUCS (Railroad Unemployment Claims System) database or RUIA interface is read by PAR application programs to retrieve information to establish
debts, post credits from administrative offset of claims being paid and adjustments to previously established debts. PAR application programs
generate a file (60-Detail) of existing debts to be recovered through offset of claims to be paid.

ARRCS (Accounts Receivable Reclamation Credit System) reads the daily DAISY activity file of Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) benefit records
terminated for death, reads the Payment and Rate History (PREH) database to calculate the debt amount and generates a file of debt records in
PAR database format to be loaded into PAR.

PAR-CANCO (Cancelled Check Operation) or Mechanical Payments (P46040), commonly considered a subset of ARRCS, formats returned cancelled benefit
checks/EFT records from the Cancelled Check Operation as PAR cash receipt records and reads the PAR database to identify the open debt to be
credited.

ORCS (Overpayment Recovery Correspondence System), currently a DBASE application, but is being converted to Visual Studio/ASP.net, uploads data
from manual input in PAR database formatted debt and cash receipt records. ORCS also uploads debt, offset and due process information to ASTRO.

Pay.gov is a secure government-wide web-based collection portal which allows government agencies to upload bills for debts and external
customers to make payments on debts using credit cards or ACH direct debit from their bank accounts. RRB PAR application formats and deposits a
file of debts on to an RRB FTP server. RRB contractor provided application accesses RRB's secure FTP server to retrieve and transmit a bill file
for debts and to deposit collections onto the server. The contractor retrieved collection files are converted into PAR database cash receipt
format and uploaded to PAR nightly.

Lockbox (RRA, RUIA and Medicare Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA) Part D) is a Treasury contacted operation which establishes a
Demand Deposit Account (DDA) with provider financial institutions that allows external customers to mail checks for payment of debts to the RRB.
US Bank, our current provider, receives, deposits (through the Federal Reserve) and transmits a daily file of payments via Advantis Network.
Collection files are retrieved and converted into PAR database cash receipt format and uploaded to PAR nightly after reading the PAR database to
retrieve and validate debt information.

TAS (Tax Accounting System), a DB2 database which stores information regarding tax withholding from RRA benefits and generates tax related
notices to customers. Information regarding written-off debts is offloaded from to USTAR (Universal System for Tracking Assignments and
Reporting) for retrieval by TAS.

The Imaging System is used to transform paper documents into electronic documents that can be viewed from a personal computer. It is an
automated process of scanning, enhancing, converting, routing, indexing and storing documents. The Imaging system also provides comprehensive
information and document management as well as workflow tools to optimize, automate, and enhance operations. The software used for the Imaging
System is from Open Text Corporation and runs on Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft SQL 2005. PAR passes formatted bills and dunnings
to the Imaging system nightly.

USTAR (Universal System for Tracking Assignments and Reporting) is a database used in the RRB's operational areas for work assignment and
tracking. PAR files of cash receipt transactions which could not be fully applied to an open debt on PAR and processing referrals requiring
manual action on debts are offload to USTAR.

EDMA (Employment Data Maintenance) application stores information employment data on Railroad employee. A PAR file of open and closed debts is
offloaded nightly to update EDMA records with debt indicators for potential offset benefits payable under RRA or RUIA.

RRXR (Railroad Experience Rating system) is a database used to maintain and access records of employer contribution and compensation reports,
employee benefit payments, and benefit recoverables and recoveries. This information is used for the purpose of calculating individual employer
experience-rated contribution rates under the RUIA. A file of collections against debts under RUIA is passed to RRXR from PAR nightly.

RESCUE, APPLE (Application Express) system, ROC (Retirement Online Calculations), Surpass (Survivor Payment System) are mechanical systems used
in the payment of benefits under RRA. A PAR file of open and uncollectible debts is generated nightly for use in offsetting benefit payments for
outstanding debts.

TOF (Transfer of Funds) formats PAR cash receipts from administrative offset of RRA benefits to collect RUIA debts.

CHICO matches new entitlement records under RRA with open and uncollectible debts on PAR for potential recovery of delinquent RUIA debts through
offset of RRA benefits.

Treasury Cross Servicing Program (Referral), selects debts based on predefined agency criteria and transmits a file to the U.S. Treasury which
includes delinquent debts referred for enforced collection, adjustments to previously referred debts and a record of collections received
directly by RRB on previously referred debts.

Treasury Cross Servicing Program (Collections), retrieves a file of collections transmitted to RRB from the Treasury via Connect Direct,
converts collections into PAR cash receipt format and load collections to PAR for credit to individual debts.

TRACS (Treasury Accounting Credit System) program retrieves a file of collections transmitted to RRB from the Treasury via Connect Direct,
converts collections into PAR cash receipt format and load collections to PAR for credit to individual debts.

RR1E program retrieves a file of debts caused by Social Security Administration (SSA) entitlement or adjustments, converts records into
formatted debt and cash receipt format and loads to PAR for establishment of and credit to individual debts.
