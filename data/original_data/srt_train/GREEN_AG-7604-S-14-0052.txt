Subpart B -- Technical Standards

Note: If there is a possibility that the provision applies, the default value is “Yes”.

    • Column one is the full text of the provision from the Standard.
    • Column two documents the agency’s accessibility requirement based on common characteristics of the EIT deliverable.  Place a Yes or No in
      this column based on program need and actual characteristics of your expected deliverable (i.e., Is this provision seen as applicable to
      the expected deliverable?)
    • Column three provides explanatory information about the provision to help both the agency in determining applicability and the vendor in
      providing accessibility information.
    • Column four is for the vendor to check off whether the deliverable meets, partially meets or does not meet the specific provision.
    • Column five is for the vendor to provide an explanation of how the deliverable meets or does not meet the specific provision.  It is also
      an opportunity to explain why a deliverable does not have an applicable feature or why it has a feature that was not identified as
      applicable.

Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within the scope of the classifications listed may be added after award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses (29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).

----------------------------------------------------------------

The body of each wage determination lists the classification and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular rate is union or non-union.

Union Identifiers An identifier enclosed in dotted lines beginning with characters other than "SU" denotes that the union classification and rate have found to be prevailing for that classification. Example: PLUM0198-005 07/01/2011. The first four letters , PLUM, indicate the international union and the four-digit number, 0198, that follows indicates the local union number or district council number where applicable , i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number, 005 in the example, is an internal number used in processing the wage determination. The date, 07/01/2011, following these characters is the effective date of the most current negotiated rate/collective bargaining agreement which would be July 1, 2011 in the above example. Union prevailing wage rates will be updated to reflect any changes in the collective bargaining agreements governing the rates.

Page 6 of 7

0000/9999: weighted union wage rates will be published annually each January.

Non-Union Identifiers Classifications listed under an "SU" identifier were derived from survey data by computing average rates and are not union rates; however, the data used in computing these rates may include both union and non-union data. Example: SULA2004-007 5/13/2010. SU indicates the rates are not union majority rates, LA indicates the State of Louisiana; 2004 is the year of the survey; and 007 is an internal number used in producing the wage determination. A 1993 or later date, 5/13/2010, indicates the classifications and rates under that identifier were issued as a General Wage Determination on that date. Survey wage rates will remain in effect and will not change until a new survey is conducted.

---------------------------------------------------------------WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS 1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can be: * * * * an existing published wage determination a survey underlying a wage determination a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on a wage determination matter a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.) and 3.) should be followed. With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal process described here, initial contact should be with the Branch of Construction Wage Determinations. Write to: Branch of Construction Wage Determinations Wage and Hour Division U.S. Department of Labor 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. Washington, DC 20210 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an interested party (those affected by the action) can request review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to: Wage and Hour Administrator U.S. Department of Labor

7/1/2014

Page 7 of 7

200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. Washington, DC 20210 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the interested party's position and by any information (wage payment data, project description, area practice material, etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue. 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board). Write to: Administrative Review Board U.S. Department of Labor 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. Washington, DC 20210 4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final. ================================================================ END OF GENERAL DECISION

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION 1. IDENTIFICATION OF AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: The requisitioning activity for the requirement is the United States Forest Service, Chief Information Officer (CIO), and the Contracting Activity is the United States Forest Service, WO-AQM IT Support Branch. 2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED: This action will be awarded as a firm fixed price brand name purchase for Modular Communications (Moducom) Systems radio dispatch consoles, for the United States Department of Agriculture Chief Information Office (CIO), Tonto National Forest (NF) Mesa, Maricopa ,AZ Dispatch Center. 3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY'S NEED INCLUDING ESTIMATED THE VALUE: This requirement provides a new replacement multi-processor-based position controller for the Tonto NF Fire Dispatch Office in Mesa, Maricopa, AZ. Moducom has Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) capability that allows for easy interface with current VoIP systems and 80% of the Fire Dispatch Systems in Region 3 are Moducom allowing the agency the ability to upgrade current inventory outside the planned forest replacement cycle with units under warranty, reducing Forest Service non-warranty repair costs.

4. IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: In accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2), when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 5. A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED: Moducom dispatch system equipment is the only known product that meets the Forest Service requirements as follows: Moducom has engineered an interface with the P25 Conventional Digital Fixed Stations. Their current Digital Fixed Station Interface (DFSI) is compatible with Daniels Radio, which is the FS radio backbone standard for radio repeaters that allows for communication between Fire Dispatch and emergency/field personnel. Moducom is the only console provider with a fully digital back plane and guarantees to be fully APCO 25 (P25 digital) compliant. Moducom exclusively provides a LAN interface to allow remote dispatching between FS dispatching centers; this interface is not interoperable with other vendor dispatching systems. No manufacturer other than Moducom has come forth with the capability to provide this interoperability. Since the current dispatch system is a Moducom system adding other manufacturer equipment would not be compatible with the current system and equipment.

6. A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY SUBPART 5.2 AND, IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER 5.202 APPLIES: In reviewing the technical requirements and compatibility constraints of this project, the Techincal Program Office has been determined that even by limiting full and open competition, it will not prevent the Forest Service in receiving fair and reasonable pricing for the product being procured. Informal market research was conducted and historical acquisition data was reviewed and it was found that similar Moducom parts and systems have been acquired by utilizing FedBid which has produces a annual cost saving of $3,000. Therefore, the Forest Service will be able to obtain competitive pricing that is fair and reasonable for the product needed to meet this mission objective. 7. A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE: This is a firm fixed price contract. Historical purchases have been assessed in order to gauge the expectation of reasonable pricing. Based on the review of this historical data and current catalogue pricing for the service parts being purchase, it is expected that proposed prices will be found to be fair and reasonable prior to contract award. 8. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONCLUDED: Based upon past acquisition history, the US Forest Service was able to obtain competitive pricing from a number of resellers of Moducom products, and has produced fair and reasonable pricing for the Forest. Therefore it is the intent of the Forest Service to issue offers to small business vendors that are resellers of Moducom products. 9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: In reviewing the technical requirements and compatibility constraints of this project, the primary hurdles that limit these efforts to other than full and open competition are derived from the expertise solely possessed by Moducom sytesms. An example is other vendors provide paging but most do not provide it to the level called for in Forest Service specifications of dispatch consoles. In addition, Moducom provides an interface to Computer Aided Drawing (CAD) systems to allow the external CAD to page through the UltraCom system. Many other vendor of similar products do not offer channel as well as frequency steering. Knox Box or user definable mode is not offered by any other vendor. In addition Moducom's UltraCom system has a manual diagnostics capability that other vendors' products do not include.

ATTACHMENT 7 ADDENDUM TO PROVISION FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION CRITERIA EVALUATION PROCEDURES AND BASIS OF AWARD 1.0 INTRODUCTION

This section defines the evaluation criteria the Government will consider in evaluating the Offeror's capabilities and proposal submitted for the Moducom Dispatch Consoles and Installation acquisition. The Government will conduct an integrated evaluation of all parts of the Offeror's proposal, which is composed of a written Technical Capability volume, a Contract Documentation volume, and a Price volume. Responses to any additional requests for information from the Government will also be evaluated. The specific criteria show the scope of evaluation to be performed on the proposal submitted in response to this RFP. The instructions to Offerors define the proposal elements and data required from the Offeror for this evaluation. 2.0 2.1 BASIS FOR AWARD Best-Value Source Selection

The Government seeks to award one Firm Fixed Priced contract based upon Best Value assessment. This acquisition will utilize the Full Trade-off source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision. Your proposals will receive a Technical rating, a Past Performance rating, and an evaluated price. The Technical Capability rating will be based upon an integrated assessment of the Technical. The contract award is subject to an affirmative contractor responsibility determination in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, and a conclusion that the proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representation, certifications, and all other information required by the Instructions to Offerors of the solicitation). 2.2 Compliance with Terms and Conditions You are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements in order to be eligible for award. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the solicitation may result in your proposal being removed from consideration for award. Any exceptions to the solicitation's terms and conditions must be fully explained and justified, and may render your proposal to be unacceptable. 2.3 Rejection of Unrealistic Proposals The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated and determined to be unrealistic in achieving the objectives and/or tasks of the Moducom Dispatch Consoles and Installation requirements, contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost when compared to Government estimates. This reflects an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the requirements. 2.4 Correction Potential of Proposals The Government will consider, throughout the evaluation, the "correction potential" of any deficiency. The judgment of such correction potential is within the sole discretion of the Government. Your proposal may be rejected if any aspect of the proposal does not meet the technical requirements. 2.5 Discussions 1

If, during the evaluation period, it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to hold discussions, Your responses to Evaluation Notices (ENs), and the Final Proposal Revision (FPR) will be considered in making the source selection decision. NOTE: The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. However, discussions may be held if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary (see FAR provision 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors, Competitive Acquisition). 3.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA

Your proposals will be evaluated based upon the information included in 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors ­ Commercial Items, with Addendum, and 52.212-2, Evaluations ­ Commercial Items, with Addendum. Your response to contract documentation (Attachment 1 through Attachment 2) shall be evaluated for completeness and in accordance with the instructions for submission. Failure to complete the required contract documentation, or deviation from the instructions cited in the request for proposal, may result in you no longer being considered for award. 3.1 Evaluation Factors

The Government will evaluate proposals based upon the following factors: Factor 1 - Technical Factor 2 ­ Past Performance Factor 3 - Cost/Price 3.2 Relative Importance of Evaluation Factors. The relative importance of each factor as follows: For the Non-Price Factors the Technical Factor is more important than Past Performance. All evaluation factors, other than Price, when combined, are more important than price; however, price will contribute to the selection decision. 3.3 508 Evaluation Factors.

3.3.1 Responses to this RFP will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (i.e. accessibility capabilities and past performance, a completed GPAT or VPAT) will be eligible for any additional consideration. 3.3.2. If the deliverable proposed in response to this RFP includes features and functions in addition to those identified as requirements, these features and functions also need to conform to relevant Section 508 technical provisions, functional performance criteria, and information, documentation and support. The accessibility of these additional features and functions should be described in the completed GPAT, VPAT or equivalent supporting information. 3.4 Technical Evaluation Procedures

3.4.1 Factor Assessment: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's Technical Factor processes as they pertain to Moducom Dispatch Consoles and Installation requirements.

UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE No performance record is identifiable or the entities performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. Rating SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE

3.5.2 Recency Assessment: An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated. 3.5.3 Relevancy Assessment: The Government will conduct an in-depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine how closely the products provided/services performed under those contracts relate to the Technical Factor, including their relative order of importance (reference paragraph 3.2 entitled Importance of Evaluation Factors). A relevancy determination of the entities (including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s)) past performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations. The Government will use the following degrees of relevancy when assessing recent, relevant contracts: Past Performance information found to be Not Relevant will not be evaluated further. Description Past/present performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this RELEVANT (R) Past/present performance effort involved much of the solicitation requires. magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation SOMEWHAT RELEVANT Past/present requires. performance effort involved some of the (SR) magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation NOT RELEVANT (NR) Past/present requires. performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. 3.5.4 Performance Quality Assessment: The Government will consider the performance quality of recent, relevant efforts. The quality assessment may result in positive or adverse findings. Adverse is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comment received from sources without a formal rating system. For adverse information identified, the evaluation will consider the number and severity of the problem(s), mitigating circumstances, and the effectiveness of corrective actions that have 4 Degree HIGHLY RELEVANT (HR)

3.5.6 Assigning Rating: As a result of the relevancy and assessments of the recent contracts evaluated, entities will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating. The performance confidence assessment rating is made at the factor level and represents the government's confidence in the entities ability to perform the effort. Entities without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating for the Past Performance factor. More recent and relevant performance may have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence Assessment than less recent or relevant effort. 3.6 Price Evaluation Procedures

3.5.1 The Offeror's Price Proposal will be assessed for reasonableness, realism, and affordability using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 15.404. This will include an evaluation of the extent to which proposed costs indicate a clear understanding of the solicitation requirements, and reflect a sound approach to satisfying those requirements. If the cost reasonableness/realism assessment indicates the proposed Price is excessively high or low, the Government may consider the Offeror to have a lack of understanding of the technical requirements and the proposal considered unreasonable and/or unrealistic will be excluded from further consideration for award. 3.5.2 The Government shall determine the total contract value by adding all priced CLINs, to include option CLINs and the pre-priced Travel CLINs. 5

3.6 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices or are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
