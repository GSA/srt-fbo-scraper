13. Description of Amendment/Modification (Organized by UCF section headings, including solicitation/contract subject matter where feasible.)

   a.  The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received from Offerors.

Q1. Is there an incumbent for this work or is this a brand new requirement?
Answer:  New requirement

Q2. If there is an incumbent, who is the incumbent and has their performance been considered acceptable for the requirements?
Answer:  See answer to question Q1.

Q3.  Is the successful vendor required to hold a GSA Schedule?
Answer:  No

Q4. Is the successful vendor required to have a security clearance?

Answer:  No

Q5. I’m curious if there might be any clarification available for the following requirement:
“3.8” The emergency alert web-site must contain a drop-down device that allows for standardization of voice and text contact for message senders
and recipients”

Answer:  3.8 should read as follows:  “The emergency alert web-site must contain a drop-down menu that allows for standardization of voice and
text contents”.   Examples: weather alert, early departure alert, office closure alert, etc.  Note: These are only examples.

b. The proposal submittal closing/due date remains April 30, 2009 at 2:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT).
                                                                (End of Amendment)
