SECTION C Â­ DESCRIPTION, SPECIFICATION, WORK STATEMENT
C.1 BACKGROUND The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation. NHTSA's primary mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and to reduce trafficrelated deaths and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. This is accomplished by:     Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment; Researching and demonstrating promising strategies to influence positive traffic safety behaviors; Providing grants to state and local governments to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs; and Planning and executing strategic communication campaigns to support program activity.

Two of NHTSA's national priority programs are designed to increase seat belt use and prevent drunk driving. Research has demonstrated that increasing belt use and preventing drunk driving will have the most significant impact on meeting NHTSA's core mission. NHTSA also develops messaging and materials on child passenger safety, distracted driving, speeding, and highway safety issues pertaining to teens, motorcycles, pedestrians, bicycles, school buses, and older drivers. Drunk driving deaths account for nearly 31 percent of all traffic fatalities annually. Drunk driving is one of the most often committed crimes in America, affecting 1 in 3 Americans annually, resulting in 1 fatality every hour, 27 deaths every day. Almost 10,000 people lost their lives in 2011 in crashes involving drivers with blood alcohol content (BAC) of .08 and above. It is estimated that increasing seat belt use can reduce fatalities by up to 45 percent in passenger cars and 60 percent in light trucks. Every increase in seat belt use translates to lives saved and injuries prevented. NHTSA estimates that every one percentage-point increase represents 2.8 million more Americans buckling up, 250 additional lives saved, and 4,000 fewer serious injuries annually. Every day in 2011, an average of 2 children age 12 and younger were killed and an average of 340 were injured in motor vehicle traffic crashes as occupants and passenger vehicles. For children ages 1 through 12, it is the leading cause of death. NHTSA is committed to working closely with partners, safety advocates, and directly with consumers to help those who transport children make the kind of choices to keep them alive and safe. Crash-related motorcycle fatalities increased by 2 percent in 2011 compared to 2010. In 2011, 4,612 motorcyclists were killed and an additional 81,000 motorcyclists were injured. These cumulative increases have become a challenge to NHTSA' progress in increasing highway safety. Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death among Latinos from the ages of 1 to 34 years, and the third overall cause of death. Crashes are twice as likely to kill Latino male teenagers as their white counterparts, although teenage Latino males drive fewer miles. As the Latino population continues to increase in the United States, their exposure to traffic crashes and resultant injuries and fatalities is also expected to increase. Therefore, it is clear that specialized public information efforts designed to positively and demonstrably change traffic safety behaviors among the Latino population are required. To meet its mission of decreasing fatalities and injuries on our Nations' roadways, NHTSA must continue to develop culturally appropriate messaging and materials on seat belts, child passenger safety, drunk 7

driving, motorcycles, pedestrians, bicycles, school buses, older drivers, distracted driving, and other NHTSA-based communication initiatives. NHTSA's behavioral communications strategy utilizes an integrated approach to develop and implement its communications programs. This integrated approach includes reviewing traffic data, market research, advertising, media relations, collateral materials, partnerships, and evaluations. While highly visible enforcement activity continues to be the anchor for the national communications program, other integrated communications activity must continue throughout the year to keep the message fresh and in front of the American public. Consistent and continual reminders of the horrific human and economic costs of motor vehicle crashes must be developed. Effective communication must be maintained not only with the target audiences, but policy makers must also be made aware of the potential lifesaving actions they can take to alleviate these problems. C.2 OBJECTIVE The objective of this Contract is to provide timely, efficient, effective and expert marketing, public relations and advertising support to NHTSA, and its partners, in the management of its national seat belt and alcohol campaigns and other highway traffic safety programs regarding child passenger safety, distracted driving, speed, pedestrian, motorcycle, bicycle, school bus, and older driver safety programs. In addition, the Contract may be used to develop communication materials targeting the Hispanic population to support national seat belt and alcohol campaigns. This Contract establishes the legal instrument through which Task Orders may be awarded, on an asneeded basis, to support this Contract's Objectives. C.3 PURPOSE The purpose of this Contract is to acquire integrated media, marketing, and advertising services to enhance NHTSA's behavioral safety programs through NHTSA's Office of Communications and Consumer Information (OCCI). This support will be used by NHTSA, state partners, highway safety and public health advocates throughout the United States to promote traffic safety messages; raise traffic safety awareness; and increase positive traffic safety behaviors among segmented targeted populations through the combination of enforcement and related media support for the national seat belt and impaired driving campaigns. In addition, support is needed for strategically designed communication initiatives that support programs relating to child passenger safety, motorcycles, pedestrians, bicycles, school buses, distracted driving, older drivers, and other NHTSA-based communication initiatives as identified. C.4 CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS C.4.1 Location of Key Contractor Staff To ensure close coordination between the Government and the Contractor, and to respond to requirements with short deadlines, the Contractor shall maintain key project staff and facilities within the District of Columbia metropolitan area. The Contractor shall plan on maintaining these facilities outside DOT Headquarters or other federal government facilities (i.e., the federal government will not provide the Contractor with facilities and/or equipment needed to perform this contract's efforts directly. Rather, any costs associated with maintaining the Contractor's facilities shall be recovered as part of the Contractor's Indirect Cost Rates.)

C.4.2 Contract Kickoff Meeting Although specific requirements shall be identified in each individual Task Order, the Contractor shall, as part of Task Order 01, participate in a Contract Kickoff Meeting within seven (7) days after Contract Award. Key members of the Contractor's staff shall meet with key NHTSA personnel (at NHTSA Headquarters in Washington, DC) to discuss the performance and administration of this Contract and awarded Task Orders. More specifically, the terms and conditions of the Contract, the Task Order review and award process, and the invoice submission and approval process will be discussed. C.4.3 General Requirements As discussed in Section H of this Contract, specific project requirements will be assigned to the Contractor through execution of Contract Task Orders. In general terms, Task Order requirements could include the following:  Develop a national year-long research-based strategic and tactical communication plan for all highly visible enforcement (HVE) campaigns and other priority highway safety issues. The plan shall also provide strategies and tactics for time periods beyond the HVE times. Provide technical assistance to NHTSA to develop and promote traffic safety communications to reduce crashes, and the resulting injuries and deaths to English and Hispanic speaking populations. Expertise needed includes the ability to conduct market research, understand the use of multimedia platforms that include TV, radio, print, outdoor, and Internet developing and/or reviewing media plans; develop communication strategies and tactics, use social media, and develop collateral materials to support state/local campaigns. Develop national media buy plans for each cycle of paid advertising and, once approved, place advertising. Media waves support national high visibility enforcement campaigns to increase seat belt use and decrease impaired driving. It is anticipated that a minimum of three to five (3 Â­ 5) national media waves will be conducted during a calendar year and that each buy shall run for approximately 14 Â­ 17 days. Conduct market research to enable NHTSA and its partners to effectively and efficiently reach at risk and culturally appropriate target audiences as it relates to traffic safety issues. Develop, maintain, and update new or existing Websites. Acquire photography services and manage the execution of photo and video shoots necessary to carry out NHTSA programs and campaigns as required. The Contractor shall manage talent rights/fees for existing and newly created advertisements. Adapt existing materials into culturally appropriate languages, and create new materials that positively resonate with targeted populations, and meet the guideline set forth by the American Translators Association. "Refresh" existing ads and, when appropriate, develop new ads for NHTSA priority areas and emerging critical highway safety issues. Provide technical assistance to NHTSA's Regional Offices and highway safety offices in communication strategies and tactics. Provide technical assistance in planning and implementing the Office of Communication's National Strategic Communications Forum and Communications (every other year) and training sessions in states and regions at a minimum of two (2) per year. 9

Conduct and/or participate in meetings and conference calls in support of basic program management activities and provide meeting/conference notes in a timely manner. Produce and submit reports that provide well organized and detailed analysis of national campaigns and demonstration activities.

C.4.4 Examples of Past Task Orders It is anticipated that the general requirements specified in Task Order 01, and applicable to Base Year 1, will continue as requirements in Base Year 2 and any exercised Option Years. Therefore, prior to each Contract Year, the Contractor should anticipate receiving a Task Order assignment that is the same as, or very similar to that specified in Task Order 01. In addition to the known, potentially recurring requirements established in Task Order 01, this contract Section C.4.4 also provides the Contractor with examples of past Task Order requirements which were fulfilled under the preceding contract. These Task Order requirements are presented as examples only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the government to obligate funds or for the Contractor to incur costs associated with these examples. Any Government obligation of funds and the authority to incur costs for contract work shall be provided in awarded Task Orders. Examples C.4.4.1 through C.4.4.5 neither represent any current nor future known requirements under this contract. C.4.4.1 Distracted Driving Initiative: The objective of this Task Order was to use a strategy that combined technical assistance to the jurisdictions, program evaluation, earned media development, and TV, radio, print and web-based materials, along with paid media, designed to educate the driving public in two intervention communities (Hartford, CT and Syracuse, NY) about increased enforcement of State laws that ban cell phone or texting while driving, and to increase the perceived risk of enforcement. Period of Performance: Eighteen (18) months. C.4.4.2 Next Generation Click It or Ticket (CIOT) Demonstration Project: The objective of this Task Order was to provide media production services and technical assistance to support each Next Generation state's enforcement wave. More specifically, the Contractor was required to provide media services to assist the demonstration states of Arizona and Massachusetts with its high visibility enforcement efforts for the Next Generation CIOT project. The Contractor modified two (2) Next Generation TV ads with state specific photography, developed three to five (3-5) radio scripts and produced one (1) radio ad. The Contractor retagged two (2) TV and two (2) radio ads, developed two (2) media buy plans, and placed two (2) state media buys. The Contractor provided technical support and media advice and developed a state specific sample template for earned media with the message of Click It or Ticket for three enforcement waves. Period of Performance: Seventeen (17) months. C.4.4.3 Support for Second Phase of a Youth Access to Alcohol Demonstration Project : Under a separate NHTSA Task Order, two high visibility enforcement demonstration projects were developed to reduce underage drinking and to evaluate the use of high visibility enforcement of underage drinking laws and the impact on enforcing those laws on the underage population in two selected cities. For this Task Order, the Contractor analyzed data from the previous demonstration projects to determine the level of success the previous creative advertising had on the target audience, and if revisions to the creative advertising were necessary. In addition to the 10

   DTNH2213R00652

National and Regional Media and Communications Support Services

evaluation of the radio and print concepts, the Contractor, in accordance with OMB regulations, assisted in the market research by developing the screener and questionnaire prior to focus group testing. The Contractor was required to develop six (6) new print concepts and four (4) new radio concepts for testing. To determine the validity of the previous and new creative concepts, the Contractor conducted two sets of focus groups, two in each city for a total of four (4). The Contractor was required to negotiate focus testing site locations, conduct four (4) focus tests in the two (2) cities, and prepare a top line report based on the focus test findings with recommendations on which concepts were to be used for the Second Phase of the Youth Access to Alcohol Demonstration Project. The Contractor also conducted a one-day communications "workshop" at each site, to devise a media buy plan for radio and print. Period of Performance: Twenty-seven (27) months. C.4.4.4 Support for NHTSA / NASCAR Partnership The objective of this Task Order was to create television, radio, in venue advertising, print and digital media to promote a joint NHTSA / NASCAR campaign against distracted driving. In doing so, the Contractor was required to place advertising in donated media, and manage and coordinate local site activity with NASCAR. Period of Performance: Thirteen (13) months. C.4.4.5 Hyperthermia Awareness The objective of this Task Order was to provide communications support to raise awareness of the dangers to children left in vehicles, especially thru the hotter months of the year. In doing so, the Contractor was required to develop a number of key message points to be tested against the target audiences during focus group testing. The messages that resonated the best were incorporated into communications project materials. In support of the Hyperthermia Communications project, the Contractor also performed market research to ascertain messages that would resonate with the target audience. The Contractor provided the COTR with a topline report with an analysis of the research, including findings and recommendations. The Contractor submitted to NHTSA a suite of creative marketing and outreach materials which incorporated key messages about dangers to children left in vehicles. The Contractor provided recommendations for a hyperthermia communications campaign, including outreach efforts. The recommendations took known data, message development and results from market research into consideration. The Contractor was tasked to implement activities to disseminate communications materials, to support online media such as HTML templates and wireframes, to support other media, and to conduct press events. The Contractor was requested to develop paid media advertisements (to include non-traditional media), develop new ads for radio, online, and print. Work also included planning, placing media buys and providing post-buy analysis. The Contractor developed paid media recommendations after media markets were defined. Once the media strategy was selected by NHTSA, the Task Order was modified to cover the cost for Discretionary Advertising. Period of Performance: Eight (8) months.

SECTION G Â­ CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
G.1 TREATMENT OF OTHER DIRECT COSTS G.1.1 SUBCONTRACTOR LABOR AND OTHER DIRECT COSTS
(Except Statutorily-Mandated Advertising Costs)

For Subcontractor and Other Direct Costs, the Contractor will be reimbursed at cost and including appropriate indirect costs (consistent with the Contractor's usual accounting practices and FAR Part 31.) Indirect costs shall be applied only to the extent that they are not also included as part of the Contractor's Loaded Functional Area Rates as presented in Section B of this Contract. The Contractor may not apply Profit or Fee to Subcontractor or Other Direct Costs. G.1.2 STATUTORILY-MANDATED ADVERTISING (SMA) As defined and discussed in Attachment 1, Statutorily-Mandated Advertising is an Other Direct Cost category under this contract. Throughout the term of the contract, the United States Congress will provide special funding to NHTSA to be used for specifically-defined advertising campaigns. This Statutorily-Mandated Advertising (SMA) requires that 100% of this funding be used to secure advertising airtime and or secure print/internet space. No SMA funds may be diverted to pay for any other cost (either direct or indirect) nor may any SMA costs be retained by the Contractor as fee or profit. Costs associated with SMA can be substantial. During CY 2012, the Contractor invoiced the government 15 times to cover SMA costs averaging $1.5 million per invoice. One invoice reflected incurred costs of $5.5 million. To fulfill the advertising requirements of the resultant contract, the Contractor must have sufficient financial resources to incur these large costs and to carry these costs until reimbursed by the Government. In recognition of the burden Statutorily-Mandated Advertising costs may have on the Contractor, the Government has established procedures by which proper SMA invoices are processed for payment within 15 days after their receipt at the location designated in Section G.3 of this Contract. G.2 TRAVEL COSTS Travel costs will be reimbursed in accordance with FAR Part 31. G.3 SUBMISSION OF INVOICES G.3.1 Designated Billing Office (Postal Address) If sent via US Postal Service or other mail carrier, the Contractor shall submit one (1) original copy of each invoice to the following address: DOT/National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Mike Monroney Aero Center Accounts Payable Branch, AMZ-150 P.O. Box 268911 Oklahoma City, OK 73126 17

G.3.2 E-Mail Submission As an alternative to mailing, the Contractor may scan its invoice into PDF format and transmit it electronically via e-mail to the following address: 9-AMC-AMZ-NHTSA-Invoices@faa.gov The Contractor is responsible for ensuring the legibility of the PDF image. Illegible copies may be returned to the Contractor for re-scanning and may result in payment delays. G.3.3 Task Order Invoicing The Contractor shall submit its invoices by Task Order. Each Task Order invoice shall include: 1. Name and address of the Contractor. 2. Invoice date and invoice number. 3. Timeframe covered by the invoice. 4. NHTSA Contract number. 5. Task Order Number. 6. NHTSA Contracting Officer's Name. 7. NHTSA Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (TO) name. 8. Itemization of costs to include:  Identification of the Functional Area billed;  The applicable Loaded Functional Area Rates;  Number of hours worked for the invoice period for each Functional Area billed;  Extended Functional Area cost (i.e. Rate multiplied by Hours);  Identification of the Other Direct Cost categories applicable to the invoice period as well as their related costs;  Documentation supporting the Other Direct Costs claimed;  Amount for Indirect Costs applied to Other Direct Costs (consistent with Section G.1);  Total reimbursement requested for that specific invoice;  Cumulative Total of reimbursements to date for that Task Order; 9. Contractor's TIN and DUNS numbers. 10. Name and address of Contractor official where questions regarding payment should be referred. 11. Certification from the Contractor that costs claimed in the invoice are true and accurate. 18

G.4 TASK ORDERS a. In accordance with FAR 52.216-18 "Ordering," the government reserves the right to issue Task Orders by US Mail, orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods (i.e. e-mail). b. All work to be performed under this contract will be ordered through the award of Task Orders. Each Task Order will identify a specific Media/Marketing requirement which falls within the general Scope of Work of this contract as described in Section C. The majority of Task Order requirements will be varied and will be developed throughout the contract year as needs are identified. However, it is anticipated that the requirements described in Task Order 01 to this contract will be recurring for each contract year (there may be some minor changes made to those requirements each year, but for the most part, they will stay the same). Accordingly, the Contractor should anticipate that the requirements for the first Task Order issued for each contract year will be similar to those presented in Task Order 01 to this Contract. c. Each Task Order will include:  A Cover Sheet (See Attachment 2).  Statement of Work.  Milestone and Deliverable Schedule.  Budget to include a Dollar Ceiling Amount which the Contractor shall not exceed.  Other Terms and Conditions that may apply. d. This Contract includes two methods for processing Task Orders: The Standard Task Order Process and the Expedited Task Order Process. G.4.1 STANDARD Task Order Process The majority of Task Orders will be issued through use of the Standard Task Order Process: a. As needs arise, the NHTSA Office of Communications and Consumer Information (OCCI) COTR(TO)s will identify specific project requirements. Those requirements will be transmitted to the NHTSA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) as "Procurement Requests" (or "PRs"). Each PR will include:  A Statement of Work;  A listing of Key Milestones and Deliverables as well as applicable due dates;  Total period of performance for the Task Order to include a projected start date and required completion date;  Other information required by OAM. b. OAM will review the PR and, in consultation with the OCCI COTR(TO), make any revisions necessary to ensure that the Task Order requirements are clear and are within the scope of this contract. c. OAM will transmit the Task Order requirement to the Contractor as a Request for Proposal.

19

   DTNH2213R00652

National and Regional Media and Communications Support Services

d. The Contractor shall review the Task Order Request for Proposal and shall develop a cost proposal for performing that Task Order's requirements. In doing so, the Contractor shall:  Identify the appropriate Functional Areas;  Estimate the levels of effort projected for each Functional Area;  Identify the types of Other Direct costs the Contractor anticipates it will need to incur;  Provide a dollar estimate for each Other Direct cost;  Provide an explanation as to why each other Direct Cost must be incurred as well as justification for the cost estimate;  Apply appropriate indirect costs (consistent with the terms and conditions of this contract);  Provide the Total Estimated Cost Ceiling for the Task Order. e. In addition to the cost proposal, the Contractor may also be required to submit a technical plan of action or other information that addresses the Contractor's approach to fulfilling the Task Order requirements. f. Within the timeframe stipulated by OAM (typically one week), the Contractor shall provide OAM with its Task Order Cost Proposal and (if applicable) plan of action. g. OAM, in consultation with OCCI COTR(TO) will review the Contractor's Task Order Proposal(s) and determine if it is acceptable, as is, or if negotiations are required. If negotiations are required, the OAM Contracting Officer will contact the Contractor and discuss any issues that must be addressed. h. Following review and negotiations (if necessary), OAM Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a formal Task Order document for execution. The Contractor shall sign, date and return a copy of the Task Order to the Contracting Officer. Upon receipt, the Contracting Officer will sign, date, and provide the Contractor with a fully executed copy of the Task Order. To expedite the process, signed copies are typically scanned into PDF format and transmitted, via e-mail, between the Contractor and the OAM Contracting Officer. G.4.2 EXPEDITED TASK ORDER PROCESS There will be occasions when requirements are so urgent that the Standard Task Order Process would not result in a timely award. In these situations, an Expedited Task Order Process will be used as follows . a. NHTSA's COTR(TO) will identify an urgent Task Order requirement which justifies use of Expedited Task Order Process. b. The COTR(TO) will submit a DRAFT Task Order Statement of Work directly to the Contractor. c. The Contractor shall review the DRAFT Statement of Work and, based on its requirements, will submit a Cost and (if applicable) Plan of Action or Technical Proposal to 20

   DTNH2213R00652

National and Regional Media and Communications Support Services

the COTR(TO). The Cost Proposal shall contain the information discussed in G.4.1.d above. d. The COTR(TO) will review the Contractor's submission and, if found acceptable, will submit the DRAFT Statement of Work and Contractor's proposals along with a formal Procurement Request to OAM for processing. e. OAM will review the Procurement Request documentation. If necessary, the OAM Contracting Officer may issue a memo to the Contractor authorizing it to begin work and incur pre-Task Order Award costs (up to a specified ceiling amount) while the procurement request is being reviewed further. See Attachment 3 for an example of a Pre-Award Authorization Memo. The Contracting Officer will review the DRAFT Task Order Statement of Work to ensure that it is within the scope of this Contract, is unambiguous, and is contractually sound. The Contracting Officer will also review the cost proposal to determine if it is fair, reasonable, and its costs are allowable under, and allocable to, this specific Task Order. If the Contracting Officer finds all documents to be acceptable, then he/she will issue the formal Task Order award document to the Contractor for execution. The steps in G.4.1.h above will then be followed. If, on the other hand, the Contracting Officer does not find all Task Order documents to be acceptable, then the Contracting Officer will contact the Contractor and the COTR(TO) to discuss the Task Order requirements and work on resolving any issues. Depending upon the severity of problems with the Task Order documentation, the Contractor may be required to Stop Work on the Task Order until the problems are resolved or, in the most extreme case, the Task Order will be terminated. G.4.3 TASK ORDER LIMITATION OF FUNDS Task Orders may be fully funded at time of Task Order Award, or incrementally funded. Incrementally funded Task Orders issued under this contract are subject to FAR 52.232-22 "Limitations of Funds" (APR 1984). G.5 GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL G.5.1 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE, "COTR" a. The Contracting Officer will designate a technical representative to assist in monitoring the work under this contract. The "Contracting Officer's Technical Representative" or "COTR" is responsible for monitoring progress and performance as well as assisting the Contracting Officer in the administration of this IDIQ contract. b. The COTR IS NOT AUTHORIZED to change the scope of work or specifications as stated in the contract, to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government, or to authorize any changes which affect the contract prices, delivery schedules, period of performance or other terms or conditions. The Contracting Officer is the only individual authorized to make such change.

c. In the event any action by the COTR (or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative, Task Order" as identified in Paragraph G.5.d below) is interpreted by the Contractor as falling within the FAR clause 52.243-3 "Changes---Time-and-Materials or Labor-Hours", the Contractor shall not implement such direction, but shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing of such interpretation within five (5) calendar days after the Contractor's receipt of such direction. Such notice shall include (1) the reason upon which the Contractor bases its belief that the action falls within the purview of the "Changes" clause; and (2) the Contractor's best estimate as to any revisions to the terms of the Contract necessary to implement the change. d. The official designated below is hereby designated the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) for this contract: To Be Identified At Time of Contract Award G.5.2 ALTERNATE CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE, "ACOTR" a. The Contracting Officer will designate a technical representative to serve as the "Alternate Contracting Officer's Technical Representative" or "ACOTR." The ACOTR will have all the responsibilities, and limitations, of the COTR when the COTR is not available. b. The official designated below is hereby designated the Alternate Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (ACOTR) for this contract: To Be Identified At Time of Contract Award G.5.3 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE, TASK ORDER, "COTR(TO)" a. The Contracting Officer will designate a technical representative to serve as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative for each awarded Task Order. The "COTR(TO)" will have the same responsibilities and limitations as the contract's COTR, however, those duties and limitations are restricted to the specific Task Order for which that individual is designated. The COTR(TO) will also be responsible for reviewing all invoices submitted for those Task Orders and recommending to the Contracting Officer that they be approved for payment or informing the Contracting Officer of any problems which may result in the rejection and return of the invoices back to the Contractor. b. COTR(TOs) will be identified in each awarded Task Order. G.5.4 ALTERNATE CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE, TASK ORDER, "COTR(TO)" As was the case for the Alternate COTR for the Contract, the Contracting Officer may also designate an Alternate COTR for each Task Order. This individual would have the same authority and responsibilities as the COTR(TO), but only when the COTR(TO) is not available to perform those duties. The ACOTR will also be designated in each awarded Task Order.

H.7 ETHICS AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT (JUN 2009) H.7.1 DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST a. It is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) policy not to award contracts to offerors whose objectivity may be impaired because of any related past, present, or currently planned interest, financial or otherwise, in organizations regulated by NHTSA or in organizations whose interests may be substantially affected by NHTSA activities. Based on this policy: b. The offeror shall provide a statement in its technical proposal which describes in a concise manner all past, present or currently planned organizational, financial, contractual or other interest(s) with an organization regulated by NHTSA or with an organization whose interests may be substantially affected by NHTSA activities, and which is related to the work under the request. The interest(s) described shall include those of the offeror, its affiliates, proposed consultants, proposed Subcontractors and key personnel of any of the above. Past interest shall be limited to within one year of the date of the offeror's technical proposal. Affected organizations shall include, but are not limited to, the insurance industry. Key personnel shall include any person owning more than a 20% interest in the offering firm, and the offeror's corporate officers, its senior managers and any employee who is responsible for making a decision or taking an action on this contract where the decision or action can have an economic or other impact on the interests of a regulated or affected organization. c. The offeror shall describe in detail why it believes, in light of the interest(s) identified in (a) above, that performance of the proposed contract can be accomplished in an impartial and objective manner. d. In the absence of any relevant interest identified in (a) above, the offeror shall submit in its technical proposal a statement certifying that to its best knowledge and belief, no affiliation exists relevant to possible conflicts of interest. The offeror must obtain the same information from potential Subcontractors prior to award of a subcontract. e. The Contracting Officer will review the statement submitted and may require additional relevant information from the offeror. All such information, and any other relevant information known to NHTSA will be used to determine whether an award to the offeror may create a conflict of interest. If such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may (a) disqualify the offeror, or (b) determine that it is otherwise in the best interest 26

   DTNH2213R00652

National and Regional Media and Communications Support Services

of the United States to contract with the offeror and include appropriate provisions to mitigate or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded. f. The refusal to provide the disclosure or representation, or any additional information as required may result in disqualification of the offeror for award. If nondisclosure or misrepresentation is discovered after award, the resulting contract may be terminated. If after award, the Contractor discovers a conflict of interest with respect to this contract; an immediate and full disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer. The disclosure shall include a description of the action which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, to avoid or mitigate such conflict. The Contracting Officer may, however, determine that it is necessary to terminate the contract. H.7.2. ACCESS TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION Work under this contract may involve access to sensitive information* which shall not be disclosed by the Contractor unless authorized by the contracting officer. To protect sensitive information, the Contractor shall provide training to any Contractor employee authorized access to sensitive information and, upon request of the Government, provide information as to an individual's suitability to have such authorization. Contractor employees found by the Government to be un-suitable or whose employment is deemed contrary to the public interest or inconsistent with the best interest of national security, may be prevented from performing work under the particular contract when requested by the contracting officer. The Contractor shall ensure that Contractor employees are citizens of the United States of America or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence or employment (indicated by immigration status) as evidenced by investigations in accordance with DOT Order 1632.20, Personnel Security Management. The Contractor shall include the above requirements in any subcontract awarded involving access to Government facilities, sensitive information, and/or resources. *Sensitive Information is proprietary data or other information that, if subject to unauthorized access, modification, loss or misuse could adversely affect national interest, conduct of Federal programs, or privacy of individuals specified in the Privacy Act, but has not been specifically authorized to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy under an Executive Order or Act of Congress. H.7.3 CONTRACTOR IDENTIFICATION CLAUSE All Contractor personnel using DOT information technology and communications systems (including the DOT email system), attending internal or external meetings, answering Government telephones, and working in other situations where their Contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of Government employees, other Contractor personnel or members of the public that they are Government officials, unless, in the judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. Among other things, Contractor personnel must include the following signature block in all email communications, internal or external, and in all internal written documents.

SECTION M Â­ EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
M.1 EVALUATION AND AWARD PROCESS M.1.1 Evaluation of Proposals There are four phases in the evaluation process. M.1.1.1 Phase One: Initial Screening for Compliance with Section L Requirements The Government will review the material submitted by the Offeror in response to Section L to determine if all required information, documents, and other information have been provided. The Offeror's response to the "Mandatory Requirements" (Section L.7.1.d and Enclosure 1) will be reviewed to ensure compliance with the Mandatory Requirements. The Offeror's failure to indicate that "it has" the necessary experience, resources, etc. to meet each Mandatory Requirement will render the entire proposal "unacceptable." The Offeror's failure to provide a brief one or two page paragraph for each Mandatory Requirement will render the entire proposal "unacceptable." Those Offerors who do not comply with the requirements of this Section M.1.1.1 will be advised that the proposal failed to meet all the Mandatory Requirements and therefore, will not receive further consideration for award. If the Offeror does comply with this Section M.1.1.1, then the evaluation process will proceed to Phase Two: Technical Proposal Evaluation. M.1.1.2 Phase Two: Technical Proposal Evaluation The Offeror's technical proposal, both written and oral as discussed Section L.7.2 of this RFP, will be evaluated for technical merit according to the criteria set forth in M.2, Evaluation Factors. M.1.1.3. Phase Three: Cost/Price Proposal Evaluation The Offeror's Cost/Price Proposal, as discussed in Section L.7.3 and applicable enclosures to this RFP, will be evaluated separate from the Phase Two "Technical Proposal Evaluation." The Price Evaluation Worksheets included as Enclosure (3) to this RFP will be used to establish a common basis on which a comparison of Offerors' prices can be established. The Offeror is advised that the Levels of Effort and Other Direct Costs presented in the Enclosure (3) Price Evaluation Worksheets INCLUDE the government's estimate of the Level of Effort and Other Direct Costs associated with Task Order 01. In as much as the Task Order 01 requirements are expected to recur during each of the five contract years, the government's estimates for Base Year 2 as well as Option Year 1, 2, and 3 also include the government's estimate for the Task Order 01 requirements. In summary, the Level of Effort and Other Direct Costs provided in Enclosure 3 for each contract year is composed of the Government's estimate for the Task Order 01 requirements plus the Government's estimate for all other Task Orders issued during each contract year.

M.1.1.4. Phase Four: Evaluation of Task Order 01 Cost/Price Proposal. The Offeror's Cost/Price Proposal for Task Order 01 (refer to Enclosures (4) and (5)) will be used by the government to determine cost realism. M.1.2 Competitive Range and right to award without discussions: The Government may conduct negotiations with those Offerors whose technically acceptable proposals, combined with its cost proposals, place it in the competitive range. The Government will conduct negotiations to the extent deemed necessary. However, Offerors are cautioned to submit proposals on the most favorable basis since the government reserves the right to make an award without further discussion, in accordance with FAR 52.215-1. M.1.3 "Best Value" Determination. The Evaluation Factors set forth in M.2 of this RFP will be used in evaluating proposals. Further guidance on requirements and criteria is provided in Section L - Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Offerors. Technical considerations are primary. Costs will not be accorded any specific numerical rating. Any contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is considered by the NHTSA Technical Evaluation Committee and the NHTSA Contracting Officer to represent the best value to the Government. The Government may accept an Offeror whose price is higher if, when combined with technical proposal, makes the offer most advantageous to the Government. M.2 TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS The following three factors will be used in evaluating the Offeror's technical proposal (both written and oral portions). The Factors are presented in descending order of importance where Factor M.2.1 is most important and Factor M.2.3 is least important. When combined, Technical Factors are of greater importance than price. M.2.1 Technical Approach and Understanding The Offeror's Technical Proposal will be evaluated based on the Offeror's methodology for developing and executing a national communications plan, consistent with the purpose and objectives of this solicitation. The Offeror will be evaluated on the soundness of its integrated communications plan using media, which may include television, radio, print, on-line, public relations, and/or event planning. The Offeror will be evaluated on its understanding of the Task Order 01 requirements and its approach to successfully, effectively, and efficiently fulfilling those requirements. M.2.2 Technical Capabilities Critical to the success of the contract will be high levels of technical and managerial skills from various disciplines, including communications, marketing, production, media planning and purchasing, and public relations. The Offeror's organizational chart will be reviewed to determine if the proposed structure is sufficient to provide the necessary support. The offeror will be evaluated on its capability to utilize its resources to fulfill the contract requirements. This includes the degree to which the requirements can be fulfilled by the Contractor's staff and the degree to which Subcontractor effort will be required. The suitability of personnel (both contractor and Subcontractor) assigned to this contract effort will be evaluated. The Offeror's media planning and purchasing capabilities will be assessed. The Offeror will be evaluated on its ability to use innovative ideas to effectively maximize media budgets, creative partnerships and leverage any 52

   DTNH2213R00652

National and Regional Media and Communications Support Services

funding that may be available for paid advertising. The Offeror's capability to coordinate delivery of technical assistance to NHTSA and the States, under severe time constraints, will be assessed. M.2.3 Experience and Past Performance The Offeror's past experience with projects similar to that addressed in this RFP will be evaluated. In addition, the degree to which the Offeror has provided acceptable services (as determined by the level of high quality customer service at a reasonable price) will be assessed. If the offeror has no record of past performance, then it will be evaluated solely on its corporate experience. If the offeror has a record of past performance, and that record is poor, the offeror will receive an overall "poor" rating for this Evaluation Factor 3.

Enclosure 2 

 

ENCLOSURE (2) FUNCTIONAL AREA COMPOSITION WORKSHEETS
As defined in Attachment 1, this RFP (and the resultant contract) include nine (9) "Functional Areas." Functional Areas are areas of technical expertise required to perform work on Task Orders issued under the resultant contract. Each Functional Area may represent a single, or a composite number of labor categories of the same or differing levels of expertise. The following steps shall be followed in completing the attached Functional Area Composition Worksheets: STEP 1: Direct Labor Categories: Identify those Direct Labor Categories the Offeror intends to use for each Functional Area. Those Labor Categories shall be entered in the Functional Area Worksheets under "Column A, Direct Labor Categories" for each Functional Area. For example, an Offeror may determine that to fulfill the requirements of the Press Events / Earned Media Functional Area, it will require an Event Coordinator I, and Event Coordinator II, a Public Affairs Specialist, and an Administrative Assistant II. The Offeror would then list each of these Direct Labor Categories under Column A of the Press Events / Earned Media Functional Area tables included as part of this Enclosure (2). STEP 2: Level of Effort Contribution: Identify the degree to which each Direct Labor Category will contribute to fulfilling each Functional Area requirement. "Contribution" is reflected as a percentage of the total effort expended for that Functional Area. Using the same Press Events / Earned Media Functional Area as an example, you may determine that this functional area would involve 30% of the Event Coordinator I's effort, 20% of the Event Coordinator II's effort, 35% of the Public Affairs Specialist's effort and 15% of the Administrative Assistant II's effort. You would therefore enter those percentage contributions in Column B of the Functional Area tables. STEP 3: Loaded Hourly Labor Rate: Provide the Loaded Hourly Labor Rate for each Direct Labor Category identified in Step 1. The Loaded Hourly Labor Rate is composed of salary, fringe benefits, G&A, Overhead, and Profit. The Offeror shall enter these loaded hourly rates in Column C of the Functional Area tables. STEP 4: Weighted Average Labor Rate: Calculate the weighted average hourly rate for each Direct Labor Category. The weighted average rate is calculated by multiplying the "Level of Effort Contribution" for each labor category (as determined in Step 2 above) times that labor rate's loaded hourly rate (as calculated in Step 3 above). The Weighted Average Labor Rate for each Direct Labor Category will then be entered in Column D of the tables. STEP 5: Loaded Fixed Functional Area Rate: Calculate the Loaded Fixed Functional Area Rate. The Loaded Fixed Rate for a Functional Area is the sum of the Weighted Average Labor Rates (calculated in Step 4 above) for that Functional Area. This Loaded Fixed Functional Area Rate shall be entered in the bottom row of each table. This rate shall also be entered in the contract's price schedules appearing in Section B.4 of this RFP and resultant contract. Example: Functional Area: Press Events / Earned Media Column A Direct Labor Category Event Coordinator I Event Coordinator II Public Affairs Specialist Administrative Asst. II Column B Level of Effort Contribution 30% 20% 35% 15% Column C Loaded hourly Labor Rate $30.00 $40.00 $50.00 $25.00 Column D Weighted Average $9 $8 $17.50 $3.75

  FUNCTIONAL AREA COMPOSITION WORKSHEETS:
The following worksheet format shall be used when calculating Loaded Fixed Functional Area Rates as discussed in the previous page. These worksheets represent one "set" of prices. The Offeror shall submit five (5) sets as part of its price proposal (one set for each of the five potential contract years.) Although the tables are formatted to accommodate three labor categories per Functional Area, Offerors are free to designate either more or fewer than three. Offerors may develop the following tables in either Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel and submit them in either format. The offeror shall enter the

calculated Loaded Fixed Functional Area Rate (see bottom row of each table) into the appropriate Price Schedule in Section B.4 of this RFP.

ENCLOSURE (3) PRICE EVALUATION WORKSHEETS
The Offeror shall complete the following five (5) Price Evaluation Worksheets and submit them as part of its Cost/Price proposal. The Government will use these evaluation worksheets to compare an Offeror's prices and costs to those submitted by other Offerors. The following instructions apply: 1. For planning and proposal purposes, the Offeror shall anticipate a contract award date of early April 2013. Base Year 1 would therefore run from April 2013 to April 2014. Base Year 2 and all subsequent option periods would also run in successive one-year increments. 2. Column B "Loaded Fixed Functional Area Rates." The Offeror shall insert the Fixed Functional Area Rate for each Functional Area as calculated in Enclosure (2). 3. Column C "Level of Effort." The hours listed in Column C represent the Government's estimate of the total number of labor hours for each associated Functional Area for the specified Contract Year. 4. Column D "Extended Functional Area Cost." The Offeror shall multiply the Loaded Fixed Functional Area Rate (Column B) by the government's estimated Level of Effort (Column C) to arrive at the Extended Functional Area Cost (Column D) for each Functional Area. 5. Total Functional Area Cost: The Offeror shall calculate the sum of all Extended Functional Area Costs (Column D) and enter the Total Functional Area Cost in the bottom row of Column D. 6. Column E "Other Direct Costs." Other Direct Costs are those costs expected to be incurred in performing the resultant contract and are not identified as Functional Area Costs (Refer to Attachment 1 "Acronyms and Definition of Terms" for complete definitions). 7. Column F "Estimated Costs." Based on historical data and potential future requirements, the government has estimated the cost for each other Direct Cost category for the specified contract year. That cost is cited in Column F. 8. Column G "Offeror's Indirect Cost Rate" The Offeror shall enter its indirect cost rate, if applicable, in Column

G (e.g. G&A, O/H, etc.) consistent with its normal accounting practices. These indirect costs may be applied to Other Direct Costs only to the extent that they are not also recovered as part of the Loaded Fixed Functional Area Rates. Indirect costs may not be applied to Statutorily-Mandated Advertising..
Column H "Extended Other Direct Cost" The Offeror shall calculate the Extended Cost for each Other Direct Cost category by multiplying the Estimated Cost (Column F) times its applicable Indirect Cost Rate (Column G) and adding that figure to the Column F amount. 10. Total Other Direct Costs: The Offeror shall calculate the sum of all Extended Other Direct Costs in Column H and enter the Total Other Direct Cost in the appropriate row at the bottom of each table. 11. Total Estimated Ceiling Amount: The Offeror shall add the Total Functional Area Cost (See #5 above) to the Total Other Direct Cost (See #10 above) to arrive at the Total Estimated Ceiling Amount for each Contract Year. 9.
