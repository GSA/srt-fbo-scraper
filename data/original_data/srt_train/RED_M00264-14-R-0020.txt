C.1.0 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES

C.1.1 Introduction.

The ultimate goal of the Advertising Services Program is to develop a successful strategic message for Marine Corps advertising and is
determined by how, when and where Marine Corps advertising reaches the diverse prospect
audience to cultivate awareness of the Marine Corps brand.  The overall success and effectiveness of this goal will be measured through DoD and
Marine Corps quantitative studies tracking brand awareness, as well as leads and contracts.

In order to meet the Marine Corps Recruiting Command (MCRC) recruiting goals, MCRC desires to increase awareness and gain support from the
American public for the Marine Corps as a world-class organization that plays a significant role in achieving national objectives. Advertising
has the capability to develop and influence public awareness about the United States Marine Corps (USMC).  To do this, MCRC must present a
message that stimulates the target's interest, remains true to the Corps and its Advertising efforts, and helps to connect the Marine Corps to
the American society and make the public aware of the unique benefits of becoming a Marine.  While not everyone can be a Marine, everyone should
understand what it means to become one and should feel a sense of pride when a loved one chooses to serve his/her country as a U.S. Marine.
Furthermore, the advertising must be engaging and informative to an audience who may not have a full understanding or appreciation of the Marine
Corps.

C.1.2 Background.

The Marine Corps Recruiting Command (MCRC) Advertising Program is directed toward the recruitment of approximately 40,000 personnel per year to
fill vacancies in both enlisted and officer programs.  There have been significant changes in the wants and needs of America’s youth over the
history of the All-Volunteer force.  The numbers and quality of personnel required for each of the Marine Corps programs can vary in response to
factors such as economic fluctuations, unemployment rates, world events, past shortfalls in recruiting, the internal reenlistment rate and
personnel ceilings established by Congress.  The Marine Corps Advertising Program spans a wide variety of channels and program elements,
including an expanded online and social media presence, an array of awareness media options, an effective lead generation program, a nationwide
support team providing advertising assistance through local event activation, and the development of recruiter sales support materials.  By
providing recruiters with sales support materials, generating leads, building relevant brand awareness, and weaving diversity into the fabric of
the Marine Corps, MCRC is focused on delivering an integrated and consistent message to reinforce the brand’s positioning among all key
prospects.  The Marine Corps strives to reinforce its timeless and timely institutional relevance amid a changing climate for defense resourcing
and an evolving global threat environment.  MCRC advertising efforts assist the Marine Corps in its endeavors to meet recruitment goals by
continually and consistently representing the epitome of military virtue.

C.1.3 Objective.

The mission of MCRC advertising is to use all the tools of marketing and communications to attempt to influence qualified prospects through the
decision-making process to becoming a Marine, and putting each prospect in front of a Marine recruiter.

The MCRC Advertising Program focuses its efforts around three (3) core competencies to achieve its mission: 1) Brand Messaging, 2) Brand
Activation, and 3) Brand Relationship.  Each of these core competencies has a role in advertising campaigns focused around several inherent
missions of the recruiting force.  These inherent missions include regular enlisted and officer, reserve enlisted and officer, and prior
service.  In addition, specific targeted campaigns may be required for certain audiences such as musicians, specific ethnic groups, females,
parents and influencers.

the rejection of such charges compel the contractor to reduce its support operation.

Subcontractor expenses regardless of what they are for shall be proposed and consent shall be granted by KO prior to purchase in accordance with
FAR 15.408, Table 15-2.

C.11.0 Period of Performance

The period of performance of this requirement shall be for a five (5) year ordering period and shall commence upon contract award.

C.12.0 Quality Control

C.12.1 Government’s Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). The QASP shall be provided at the Task Order level.  The Government will monitor
the contractor’s performance under this contract.  All actions taken by the contractor to correct defects found by the Government as a result of
QASP, and by the contractor as a result of quality control, shall be in accordance with FAR 46.607 and FAR Clause 52.246-5. 

C.12.2 Contractor’s Quality Control Plan (QCP).  The contractor shall implement a complete quality control program to identify potential and
actual problem areas in providing specified requirements of the contract and results in corrective action throughout the life of the contract. 
The contractor shall provide the QCP to the CO at the Kick-off meeting (see C.7.1) for review and final acceptance.  Changes to the QCP shall be
submitted to the ACO no later than 10 workdays prior to effective date of change.  The basic intent of the plan is that the contractor is
responsible for quality.  All methods, procedures, and forms shall support this concept.

The QCP shall:
a. Have direct accountability to the contractor’s top management.
b. Address overall project management and administration.
c. Be a comprehensive program to plan and deliver quality services to the Government.
d. Cover all services described in this contract, prioritize services, and concentrate on the most essential services as identified in the PWS.
e. Describe a method, acceptable to the Government, of identifying deficiencies in the quality of service performed under this contract before
the level of performance becomes unacceptable, and address processes for corrective actions without dependence upon Government direction.
f. Establish an inspection system covering all services required by this contract.  This plan shall specify areas to be inspected on both a
scheduled or unscheduled basis and the title of the individual who will do the inspection.  The contractor will provide the ACO with a current
list of all titled positions and the names of the incumbents.
g. Contain specific quality control techniques for contract services identified in the PWS.  The quality control methods shall be comprehensive
and adaptable to the reporting systems of the QCP.
h. Include a customer complaint feedback system for correction of validated complaints and to inform the customer of corrections.  The QCP shall
describe how users, or other interested parties, may identify problem areas or situations to the contractor.  The customer complaint program
shall be compatible with the reporting and communication systems of the QCP.
i. Require documentation of all contractor quality control inspections and corrective actions be maintained by the contactor throughout the term
of this contract.  Copies of inspection documents will be provided to the ACO upon request.
j. Describe methods of direct and indirect communications with the Government regarding performance of the contract.  The QCP shall include
regular and formal meetings with the Government and proposed formats and/or schedules for informal communications (e.g., periodic e-mails to the
COR).

C.13.0 Fixed Fee
The Government will pay the fixed fee on a quarterly basis per the dollar amount utilized during that quarter.  The Government reserves the
right to withhold a percentage of the fee, not to exceed (NTE) 1% of the fixed fee total, to use as an incentive for specifically designated
Task Orders.

C.14.0 Task Order Award Process

The Government will initiate the Task Order award process by sending the contractor a Request for Proposal (RFP), to include a PWS and QASP that
identify the Government’s requirements under the contract.    The contractor shall submit a proposal outlining the detailed description of work
to be performed, the costs, and elements that reflect the requirement set forth in the PWS.  If the contractor’s proposal exceeds $750,000, the
contractor shall be required to submit certified cost and pricing data.  All terms and conditions including price shall be subject to
negotiations.

C.15.0 Enterprise-Wide Contractor Manpower Reporting Application (ECMRA)

The contractor shall report ALL contract labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under
this contract for the US Marine Corps via a secure data collection site.  The contractor is required to completely fill in all required data
fields using the following web address:  https://doncmra.nmci.navy.mil.  Reporting inputs will be for the labor executed during the period of
performance during each Government Fiscal Year (FY), which runs October 1 through September 30.  While inputs may be reported any time during

such rights, limitations on future use, if any, and cost.  The    database for catalog storage must be searchable, in format compatible with
MCRC systems, and returnable to the Government at the conclusion of the contract.  (Also see, C.5.4.12.)

Information Technology (IT) Support.  All IT support provided shall be state of the art, effective and comply with all Government regulations
and information assurance requirements.

ongoing work, and initiatives between MCRC, contractor, and recruiting field representatives.

The contractor shall provide web hosting capability to MCRC for advertising web initiatives and lead processing systems and comply with DODI

Advertising Portal.  The Ad Portal (http://adportal.marines.com) serves as a primary access point to a variety of contractor/MCRC-provided
recruiter support tools available anytime, from anywhere. Agency staff provides the ongoing maintenance required of all of the 16 applications
available via the Advertising Portal interface, which is accessed daily by recruiters. In addition, the Media Database application, which
provides MPAs access to multiple paid and public service media contacts and outlets in order to support public service advertising and public
relations efforts, requires the ongoing licensing of the data, which bills monthly.

Film Library.  MCRC’s broadcast media assets (film and video, dating back to the 1970s), which assist in current production and, are warehoused
in a physical storage archive (film library). To ensure proper preservation of the physical assets, all assets are stored in temperature and
humidity controlled, 24-hour monitored security, FM200 fire suppression.  The storage of MCRC’s film and video assets is a 24/7 operation.

Online Advertising Resource/Digital Asset Manager.  The Online Advertising Resource (OAR) is an online repository that contains contractor/MCRC
approved national brand resources, recruiting resources, and marketing assets to help support District recruiting efforts and missions.
Available via the advertising portal, it offers instant high-resolution, print-ready PDF downloads of all assets in the OAR inventory. The
Digital Asset Manager (DAM) is included in this application. The digitization and archiving of the digital video and photo libraries is an
ongoing requirement as new content is collected.  The hosting of the assets contained in the OAR and DAM is a 24/7 operation.

Campaign Management.   The campaign management tool supports the Brand Activation program by providing campaign execution with more automated
functionality, allowing complex campaign files to be pulled simultaneously across audiences. The hosting of the campaign management tool is a
24/7 operation and the licensing of the tool is ongoing and bills monthly.

Maintenance and Hosting for MCRC Web Properties.   A critical component for both Brand Messaging and Brand Activation, as well as a primary call-
to-action published and distributed to prospects via paid media, direct mail and collateral materials, it is critical that MCRC’s web
properties, Marines.com and LifeAsAMarine.com, remain up and running 24/7.

Web maintenance allocates resources for hosting services and to evaluate and, as needed, accommodate the latest technology available to keep all
MCRC properties best-in-class and functioning without interruption. Maintenance/hosting items include:
•     Website and streaming video hosting services
•     Daily monitoring of Web and database servers
•     Programmatic repair and error tracking
•     Security monitoring and precautions
•     Program upgrades (e.g. browser fonts, etc.)
•     Technology updates based on browser optimizations (e.g. Internet Explorer)
•     Optimization based on social media platform updates (e.g. Facebook “Fan” to “Like”)

   In addition to agency staff, the multiple subcontractors that provide the above hosting and
   maintenance services operate 24/7.

Advertising Exchange.  The Advertising Exchange is the online project collaboration tool that acts as the master source for all advertising
tactics, housing a comprehensive archive of the necessary information and pertinent documentation for each project. The platform allows for
increased collaboration and confidence in communications    between MCRC personnel and the contractor and agency partners, allowing for
customizable functionality that aids in clarity and efficiency to ensure project updates are consistently provided in near real time. The
hosting of the advertising exchange tool is a 24/7 operation and the licensing of the tool is ongoing and bills monthly.

52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks “have”, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have      , have not      , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar
positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)



52.216-19      Order Limitations.  (OCT 1995)

(a) Minimum order.  When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than        (insert dollar
figure or quantity), the Government is not obligated to purchase, nor is the Contractor obligated to furnish, those supplies or services under
the contract.

(b) Maximum order.  The Contractor is not obligated to honor:

(1) Any order for a single item in excess of       (insert dollar figure or quantity);

(2) Any order for a combination of items in excess of       (insert dollar figure or quantity); or

(3) A series of orders from the same ordering office within      days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation in subparagraph
(1) or (2) above.

(c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order
limitations in paragraph (b) above.

(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) above, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in paragraph (b),
unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within      days after issuance, with written notice stating the Contractor's
intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons.  Upon receiving this notice, the Government may acquire the supplies or
services from another source.

(End of clause)


52.216-22     Indefinite Quantity.  (OCT 1995)

(a) This is an indefinite-quantity contract for the supplies or services specified, and effective for the period stated, in the Schedule.  The
quantities of supplies and services specified in the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract.

(b) Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause.  The Contractor shall
furnish to the Government, when and if ordered, the supplies or services specified in the Schedule up to and including the quantity designated
in the Schedule as the "maximum".  The Government shall order at least the quantity of supplies or services designated in the Schedule as the
"minimum".

(c) Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order Limitations clause or in the Schedule, there is no limit on the number of orders that
may be issued.  The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations.

(d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the Contractor
within the time specified in the order.  The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to that
order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be
required to make any deliveries under this contract after       [insert date].

(End of clause)



52.217-8     OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)

The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract.  These rates may
be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor.  The option provision may be exercised
more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months.  The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by
written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of contract expiration.

(End of clause)

      (2) Is fixed-price and exceeds—


           (i) For a contract awarded by the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
           greater of the simplified acquisition threshold or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of the contract; or

the price objective and in negotiating the final price;

(E) The extent to which it was recognized in the negotiation that the subcontractor’s certified cost or pricing data were not accurate,
complete, or current; the action taken by the Contractor and the subcontractor; and the effect of any such defective data on the total price

required under paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this clause.

(f) Unless the consent or approval specifically provides otherwise, neither consent by the Contracting Officer to any subcontract nor approval
of the Contractor’s purchasing system shall constitute a determination—

(1) Of the acceptability of any subcontract terms or conditions;

(2) Of the allowability of any cost under this contract; or

(3) To relieve the Contractor of any responsibility for performing this contract.

(g) No subcontract or modification thereof placed under this contract shall provide for payment on a cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost basis, and
any fee payable under cost-reimbursement type subcontracts shall not exceed the fee limitations in FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i).

(h) The Contractor shall give the Contracting Officer immediate written notice of any action or suit filed and prompt notice of any claim made
against the Contractor by any subcontractor or vendor that, in the opinion of the Contractor, may result in litigation related in any way to
this contract, with respect to which the Contractor may be entitled to reimbursement from the Government.

(2) Mission-essential functions means those organizational activities that must be performed under all circumstances to achieve DoD component
missions or responsibilities, as determined by the appropriate functional commander or civilian equivalent. Failure to perform or sustain these
functions would significantly affect DoD's ability to provide vital services or exercise authority, direction, and control.

(f) Changes. The Contractor shall segregate and separately identify all costs incurred in continuing performance of essential services in a
crisis situation. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of an increase or decrease in costs within ninety days after continued
performance has been directed by the Contracting Officer, or within any additional period that the Contracting Officer approves in writing, but

52.215-20      REQUIREMENTS FOR COST OR PRICING DATA OR INFORMATION OTHER THAN COST OR PRICING DATA (OCT 2010)
(a) Exceptions from certified cost or pricing data.
      (1) In lieu of submitting certified cost or pricing data, offerors may submit a written request for exception by submitting the information
      described in the following subparagraphs. The PCO may require additional supporting information, but only to the extent necessary to
      determine whether an exception should be granted, and whether the price is fair and reasonable.
           (i) Identification of the law or regulation establishing the price offered. If the price is controlled under law by periodic rulings,
           reviews, or similar actions of a Governmental body, attach a copy of the controlling document, unless it was previously submitted to
           the contracting office.
           (ii) Commercial item exception. For a commercial item exception, the offeror shall submit, at minimum, information on prices at which
           the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness
           of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include --
                 (A) For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items,
                 or a statement that the catalog is on file in the buying office to which the proposal is being submitted. Provide a copy or
                 describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer,
                 or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how
                 the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities;
                 (B) For market-priced items, the source and date or period of the market quotation or other basis for market price, the base
                 amount, and applicable discounts. In addition, describe the nature of the market;
                 (C) For items included on an active Federal Supply Service Multiple Award Schedule contract, proof that an exception has been
                 granted for the schedule item.
      (2) The offeror grants the PCO or an authorized representative the right to examine, at any time before award, books, records, documents,
      or other directly pertinent records to verify any request for an exception under this provision, and the reasonableness of price. For items
      priced using catalog or market prices, or law or regulation, access does not extend to cost or profit information or other data relevant
      solely to the offeror’s determination of the prices to be offered in the catalog or marketplace.
(b) Requirements for certified cost or pricing data. If the offeror is not granted an exception from the requirement to submit certified cost or
pricing data, the following applies:
      (1) The offeror shall prepare and submit certified cost or pricing data, and data other than certified cost or pricing data, and supporting
      attachments in accordance with the instructions contained in Table 15-2 of FAR 15.408, which is incorporated by reference with the same

      used I this contract, unless the PCO and the Contractor agree to a different format and change this clause to use Alternate I.
      (2) As soon as practicable after agreement on price, but before contract award (except for unpriced actions such as letter contracts), the
      offeror shall submit a Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, as prescribed by FAR 15.406-2.
                                                                (End of provision)

52.215-23 – Limitations on Pass-Through Charges (Oct 2009)
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
“Added value” means that the Contractor performs subcontract management functions that the PCO determines are a benefit to the Government (e.g.,
processing orders of parts or services, maintaining inventory, reducing delivery lead times, managing multiple sources for contract
requirements, coordinating deliveries, performing quality assurance functions).
“Excessive pass-through charge,” with respect to a Contractor or subcontractor that adds no or negligible value to a contract or subcontract,
means a charge to the Government by the Contractor or subcontractor that is for indirect costs or profit/fee on work performed by a
subcontractor (other than charges for the costs of managing subcontracts and any applicable indirect costs and associated profit/fee based on
such costs).
“No or negligible value” means the Contractor or subcontractor cannot demonstrate to the PCO that its effort added value to the contract or
subcontract in accomplishing the work performed under the contract (including task or delivery orders).
“Subcontract” means any contract, as defined in FAR 2.101, entered into by a subcontractor to furnish supplies or services for performance of
the contract or a subcontract. It includes but is not limited to purchase orders, and changes and modifications to purchase orders.
“Subcontractor,” as defined in FAR 44.101, means any supplier, distributor, vendor, or firm that furnishes supplies or services to or for a
prime Contractor or another subcontractor.
(b) General. The Government will not pay excessive pass-through charges. The PCO shall determine if excessive pass-through charges exist.
(c) Reporting. Required reporting of performance of work by the Contractor or a subcontractor. The Contractor shall notify the PCO in writing
if—
      (1) The Contractor changes the amount of subcontract effort after award such that it exceeds 70 percent of the total cost of work to be
      performed under the contract, task order, or delivery order. The notification shall identify the revised cost of the subcontract effort and
      shall include verification that the Contractor will provide added value; or
      (2) Any subcontractor changes the amount of lower-tier subcontractor effort after award such that it exceeds 70 percent of the total cost
      of the work to be performed under its subcontract. The notification shall identify the revised cost of the subcontract effort and shall
      include verification that the subcontractor will provide added value as related to the work to be performed by the lower-tier
      subcontractor(s).
(d) Recovery of excessive pass-through charges. If the PCO determines that excessive pass-through charges exist;
      (1) For other than fixed-price contracts, the excessive pass-through charges are unallowable in accordance with the provisions in FAR
      subpart 31.2; and
      (2) For applicable DoD fixed-price contracts, as identified in 15.408(n)(2)(i)(B), the Government shall be entitled to a price reduction
      for the amount of excessive pass-through charges included in the contract price.
(e) Access to records.
      (1) The PCO, or authorized representative, shall have the right to examine and audit all the Contractor's records (as defined at FAR 52.215-
      2(a)) necessary to determine whether the Contractor proposed, billed, or claimed excessive pass-through charges.
      (2) For those subcontracts to which paragraph (f) of this clause applies, the PCO, or authorized representative, shall have the right to
      examine and audit all the subcontractor's records (as defined at FAR 52.215-2(a)) necessary to determine whether the subcontractor
      proposed, billed, or claimed excessive pass-through charges.
(f) Flowdown. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (f), in all cost-reimbursement subcontracts
under this contract that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, except if the contract is with DoD, then insert in all cost-reimbursement
subcontracts and fixed-price subcontracts, except those identified in 15.408(n)(2)(i)(B)(2), that exceed the threshold for obtaining cost or
pricing data in accordance with FAR 15.403-4.
                                                                 (End of clause)

shall submit a proposal that clearly and concisely describes their response to the requirements of this solicitation.  Use of general or vague
statements such as “standard procedures will be used” will not satisfy this requirement.  Unnecessary elaboration or presentations beyond what
is sufficient to present a complete and effective solution are not desired and may be construed as a lack of understanding of the requirement.

outside the Government for copies of contract qualifications and proposals submitted to federal agencies.  If an offeror’s submissions contain
information that he/she believes should be withheld from such requestors under FOIA on the grounds that they contain “trade secrets and
commercial or financial information”, 5 U.S.C. § 552, the offeror should mark its submissions as set forth in FAR 52.215-1(e).

                                                   AWARD BASED ON BEST VALUE TO THE GOVERNMENT

M-1 INTRODUCTION

This section outlines the basis for evaluation of the offerors’ capabilities and proposals submitted in response to the solicitation, after
evaluation of offerors’ minimum requirements is completed.  The evaluation criteria describe the scope of the evaluation to be performed on each
proposal.  Section L of the solicitation describes the proposal content and format requirements.


M-1.1 A formal source selection process will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.3, Source Selection, and FAR 15.101, Best Value Continuum,
for the Advertising Services contract.  The Government will award based upon best value methodology in accordance with FAR Part 15.101-1,
Tradeoff Process.

 M-1.2 It is the intention of the Marine Corps to award a single contract to the offeror whose proposal offers the best value in terms of
Technical Capability, Past Performance, Management Approach and Cost/Price as prescribed in Section M of this solicitation.  Within the best
value continuum, the Government will employ a tradeoff analysis of cost and/or price and non-cost/price factors in evaluating the proposals
submitted. The offeror’s initial proposal shall contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint. The contract
resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation requirements, is determined to
provide the “best value” to the Government for the combined Basic IDIQ and Initial Task Order 0001.
M-1.3 Proposals will be assessed for how well the offeror’s proposal meets the solicitation requirements.  Risks associated with the offeror’s
approach may also be considered.  Proposals will also be assessed for the strengths, weaknesses and deficiencies of each offer.
M-1.4 Proposals will be evaluated based solely on the factors contained in this solicitation.  While the Government reserves the right to make
an award without discussions, discussions, if necessary will be conducted in accordance with FAR 15.306.  Award will be made to a responsible
offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as terms and conditions and technical requirements, and also provides the
best value to the Government based on the results of the evaluation described in paragraph below.
M-2 BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD


M-2.1 Unless all offers are rejected, award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation (combined with
initial Task Order 0001), is determined to be the best overall value, cost/price and other non-cost factors considered.  In determining the best
overall response, the combined non-cost factors are significantly more important than the cost/price factor.  The Government may select for
award the offeror whose cost is not necessarily the lowest, but whose technical proposal is more advantageous to the Government and warrants any
additional costs and/or prices.  However, the more equal the evaluation of non-cost/price factors among competing offers are, then the more
significant the cost/price factor becomes.

M-2.2 Offerors must satisfy the requirements described in the performance criteria, as well as other RFP requirements addressed in Section L.

|        |Cost/Price Factor                                                                 |
|4       |Cost/Price                                                                        |

The three (3) non-cost/price factors are Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Management Approach.  Under Management Approach, there are
three (3) Sub-factors: Service to the USMC MCRC Account, Purchasing System, and Small Business Participation Plan.  All Factors and Sub-factors
are listed in descending order of importance.   Factor 1 is more important than Factor 2, Factor 2 is more important than Factor 3.  Under
Factor 3, Sub-factor 3a is more important than Sub-factor 3b, and Sub-factor 3b is more important than Sub-factor 3c.  When combined, all non-
cost/price factors and Sub-factors are significantly more important than cost/price.  A rating of “Unacceptable” for any factor will result in
the entire proposal being determined unacceptable.

The following criteria will be utilized to determine an adjectival rating for each factor.  The factors relate to important program
characteristics and the proposal should meet and address the criteria to prove the offeror’s abilities.

M-3.1 Factor 1: Technical Capability - The written presentation will be evaluated using the  offeror’s submission of a marketing plan/strategy.
The marketing plan/strategy will be evaluated to determine the extent of the offeror’s understanding and insights into the Marine Corps brand
and requirement outlined in the PWS.  The presentation will also be used to evaluate the offeror’s understanding of the Marine Corps
institutional needs, target market population and the offeror’s creative capabilities and core competencies.  In evaluating this factor, the
assessment will concentrate on the offeror’s strategic understanding of challenges, and issues facing Marine Corps recruiting and how marketing
and advertising communications can be employed to address those challenges and issues in meeting overall Marine Corps goals. The extent of the
offeror’s demonstrated knowledge and understanding of the PWS, Section L solicitation requirements and the core competency in the area of
advertising, particularly for the following, will be evaluated:


      i. Understanding of the Requirements: The extent to which the offeror demonstrates a clear understanding of all tasks and requirements
         outlined in the PWS and the initial task order.


     ii. Core Capabilities: The extent to which the offeror demonstrates performance capabilities and core competencies as it relates to the PWS
         will be evaluated. Offeror’s will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror’s organization, relevant resource capabilities (e.g.,
         for advertising, traditional media planning and buying, digital/online/social media, multicultural marketing, promotions and event
         marketing, direct and database marketing and public relations), media buying volume and purchasing leverage, will meet the requirements
         of the PWS and whether the proposal provides the Government with a high level of confidence of successful performance.


    iii. Advertising Strategy:  The extent to which the proposal demonstrates the offeror’s ability to develop and execute a national
         advertising plan that generates awareness in a diverse stream of multicultural, religious and economic markets.


     iv. Completeness: The extent to which the technical requirements of the PWS have been considered, defined, and satisfied, rating each
         proposal strictly in accordance with its written content.


Additionally, an oral presentation will be evaluated using an offeror’s submission of creative materials to demonstrate understanding and
insights into the Marine Corps brand.  The presentation will also be used to evaluate the offeror’s understanding of the Marine Corps
institutional needs, target market population and the offeror’s creative capabilities.  In evaluating this factor, the assessment will
concentrate on the offeror’s demonstrated expertise and innovative capabilities to respond to the types of situations that may be encountered in
performance of a contract resulting from this solicitation.  The offeror shall particularly address the requirements of the PWS and solicitation
Section L with the following:

      i.  Creativity:  The extent to which the oral presentation demonstrates creative and innovative solutions to find new and different
         avenues by which to approach the Marine Corps’ Recruitment advertising objectives/missions as expressed in the PWS.


     ii.  Emerging, innovative and new advertising technologies:  The extent to which the oral presentation demonstrates the offeror's ability
         to develop and execute marketing and advertising opportunities that directly support the Marine Corps brand and reflect the PWS
         requirements.


M-3.2 Factor 3: Management Approach.   The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent the offeror’s management approach
demonstrates a clear understanding of the Marine Corps organization, personnel, tools and processes required to successfully support the Marine
Corps recruiting marketing challenges and issues by allocating adequate resources to the USMC MCRC account.

M-3.2.1 Sub-factor 3a: USMC MCRC Program Support.  The extent to which the offeror’s management approach demonstrates the offeror’s overall
capabilities to providing advertising services to the USMC MCRC Advertising program will be evaluated.  The following will be considered in the
evaluation:


        i.       Types of Personnel:  The extent to which the offeror’s proposal demonstrates an organizational structure with appropriate
           authorities and responsibilities to effectively manage the USMC MCRC Advertising account, emphasizing the areas of program management
           support and information technology support.  In addition, the Government shall evaluate whether there are adequate numbers of
           personnel with appropriate training and experience to carry out the work outlined in the PWS.


       ii.       Integration of Accounts:  The extent to which the offeror’s proposal demonstrates the contractor’s ability to effectively
           integrate USMC MCRC Advertising business into the existing offeror’s structure, will be evaluated.


      iii.       Management Oversight:  The extent to which offeror’s proposal demonstrates sufficient management oversight emphasis to ensure
           successful performance on the USMC MCRC Advertising account will be evaluated.


       iv.      Transition of USMC MCRC Advertising Account:  The extent to which offeror’s proposal demonstrates a plan to both effectively
           mobilize resources necessary for contract performance and transition services  supporting the USMC MCRC Advertising account from the
           incumbent contractor to the offeror without disruption to the USMC MCRC Advertising program and transition out of the contract will
           be evaluated.


        v.       Standardization/Efficiency of New Account Procedures:  The extent to which the offeror’s proposal demonstrates contract
           management support and administrative procedures in place or proposed procedures to monitor, manage and support the USMC MCRC
           Advertising account will be evaluated.


       vi. Quality Control:  The offeror’s proposal shall clearly describe the QC processes and procedures that will be utilized to control the
           quality of work, identify improvement opportunities, and verify that the mechanisms that control quality are in place so that
           advertising works meet the expectations of the Government.

M-3.2.2 Sub-factor 3b: Purchasing System.  The offeror shall be evaluated on the comprehensiveness and standardized process that the offeror
will use to purchase on the Government’s behalf.  The offeror shall be evaluated on its defined methodology on issuing subcontract agreements,
including but not limited to vendor and consultant agreements, and the process and procedures that are in place in order to ensure compliance
with statutory, regulatory and DoD requirements and policy, at the prime contract level and at all applicable sub-tier subcontractor levels.
The offeror shall be evaluated on its ability to demonstrate that its process and procedures in subcontract execution, including but not limited
to vendor and consulting agreements, achieve fair and reasonable prices on behalf of the Government.

M-3.2.3 Sub-factor 3c: Small Business Participation: All offerors, both large and small businesses, will be evaluated on the level of small
business commitment they demonstrate for this acquisition.

      M-3.2.3.1 In accordance with DFARS 215.304(c)(i), Evaluation factors and significant Sub-factors, and DFARS 215.305, Proposal Evaluation,
      will be evaluated on the following basis of:


   1) The extent to which the offeror identifies and proposes named small business subcontract agreements that are included in the Cost/Price
      Proposal, Volumes IVA and/or IVB.  In addition, the extent to which the offeror describes other intentions to pursue subcontracting
      arrangements as well as any teaming arrangements, partnerships or the like;
   2) The extent that the offeror defines the type of work that will be extended to small business along with the type of small business with
      which it intends to subcontract;
   3) The extent that the offerors’ plan describes its intent and methodology to meet targeted goals listed in Table L-4 relative to total
      contract value;


      The Small Business Participation Plan shall be evaluated using Table M-3 below.

   **Note: A proposal that receives an “unacceptable” rating for Factors 1, 3, or Sub-factors 3a, 3b, or 3c will result in the entire proposal
   being determined “unacceptable.” No further evaluation of the proposal (i.e., past performance or cost proposal) shall be performed, and the
   offeror will not be considered for award.
M-3.3 Volume II/Factor 2: Past Performance: Past Performance evaluation will be based on each offeror’s demonstrated record of recent past
performance on similar contracts to determine its relevance to the Government’s current needs, the quality of that performance, and the degree
of confidence the Government places in each offeror’s ability to meet its requirements.  Sources of Past Performance Information for Evaluation
are as follows:
   1. In accordance with NMCARS 5215.305, PPIRS shall serve as a mandatory source of information when evaluating each offeror’s relevant past
      performance.


   2. Past CPARS and FAPIIS data available from Government.


   3. Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment 4) shall be used to collect information on an offeror’s recent and relevant past performance.
M-3.3.1 Relevance of Past Performance Information.

After receipt of each offeror’s past performance information, the PPET shall consider the relevance of each offeror’s past performance in
relation to the Government’s current requirements.  In accordance with Department of Defense Source Selection Procedures (Section 3.1.3 and
Table 4) the following rating scale shall be used in evaluating Past Performance Relevance.

Table M-4
|PAST PERFORMANCE RELEVANCY RATINGS                                                                                                               |
|Aspects of relevance include similarity of service/support provided, complexity of effort, dollar value, contract type, and, where applicable,   |
|the degree of subcontracting/teaming.  To be relevant performance data needs to be recent as described in Section L of the RFP.                  |
|VERY RELEVANT                     |Present/past performance involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities as this|

There are four levels of relevancy shown in the table above. With respect to relevancy, more relevant past performance will typically be a
stronger predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance confidence assessment than past performance of lesser
relevance.

M-3.3.2 Quality of Past Performance.

|                                     |contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective.                                           |


M-3.3.3 Past Performance Confidence Assessment.

Once the PPET has completed its evaluation of the quality of relevant past performance of each offeror, an assessment rating will be assigned
reflecting the Government’s confidence that the offeror will meet the requirements stated in the RFP.  In accordance with Department of Defense
Source Selection Procedures (Section 3.1.3 and Table 5) the following rating scales shall be used in performing a Past Performance Confidence
Assessment.


Table M-6

|PAST PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT                                                                                                        |
|Confidence in an offeror’s ability to meet the Government’s proposed requirements will depend on the success of an offeror in achieving       |
|various evaluation factors relating to past performance.                                                                                      |
|SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE                   |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation    |
|                                         |that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                                     |
|SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE                  |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable          |
|                                         |expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                         |
|LIMITED CONFIDENCE                       |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that|
|                                         |the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.                                          |
|NO CONFIDENCE                            |Based on the offeror’s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that   |
|                                         |the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.                               |
|UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE (Neutral)             |No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror’s performance record is so sparse |
|                                         |that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.                         |


       
M-3.4 Factor 4: Cost and/or Price for the BASIC IDIQ CONTRACT

   M-3.4.1  Cost and/or Price Factor for the BASIC IDIQ Contract shall be addressed only in the Business Volume IVA of the offeror’s submission.
   Comparison of the proposed cost and/or price for both the Basic IDIQ and the Initial Task Order 0001 will be considered in the overall
   evaluation of “best value” to the Government based upon the anticipated level of competition. The cost and/or price factor for the entire five-
   year ordering period (including the period up to six months in accordance with FAR 52.217-8) will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.217-5-
    Evaluation of Options (July 1990). Prospective offerors are forewarned that a proposal meeting solicitation requirements with the lowest
   evaluated cost may not be selected if award to higher evaluated, higher cost/price offeror is determined to be most advantageous to the
   Government.


   M-3.4.2 The offerors business terms and conditions, including discounting strategies and related business elements, will be evaluated. No
   ambiguities of inclusion or content shall be extended and lack of content or clarity with regard to pricing may be considered as representing
   a “non-responsive” offer.


   M-3.4.3 For the BASIC IDIQ contract, in evaluating the cost/price portion of each offeror’s proposals, the Government will evaluate each
   offeror’s proposed direct and indirect rates along with the base to which indirect rates are applied.  Ultimately, the successful offeror’s
   direct and indirect rates shall be used for all subsequent Task Orders throughout the five-year ordering period that are issued against the
   Basic IDIQ.  In addition, the Government will evaluate proposed cost and/or price for completeness, reasonableness, and realism.  In
   accordance with FAR 15.404, Proposal Analysis, the Government may include a cost realism analysis to determine what the Government should
   realistically expect to pay for the proposed direct and indirect rates.


   M.3.4.4 – Financial Information – Although not an evaluation factor, the financial information   provided will be reviewed for assistance in
   determining contractor responsibility, pursuant to FAR Part 9.


   M-3.4 Factor 4: Cost and/or Price for initial Task Order 0001

   M-3.4.1  Cost and/or Price Factor for Initial Task Order 0001 shall be addressed only in the Business Volume IVB of the offeror’s submission.
   Comparison of the proposed cost and/or price is considered in the overall evaluation of “best value” to the Government based upon the
   anticipated level of competition. The cost and/or price factor for the entire five-year ordering period (including the period up to six months
   in accordance with FAR 52.217-8) will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.217-5- Evaluation of Options (July 1990). Prospective offerors
   are forewarned that a proposal meeting solicitation requirements with the lowest evaluated cost may not be selected if award to higher
   evaluated, higher cost/price offeror is determined to be most advantageous to the Government.


   M-3.4.2 The offerors business terms and conditions, including discounting strategies and related business elements, will be evaluated. No
   ambiguities of inclusion, or content shall be extended and lack of content or clarity with regard to pricing may be considered as representing
   a “non-responsive” offer.


   M-3.4.3 In evaluating the cost/price portion of each offeror’s proposals, the Government will evaluate proposed cost and/or price for
   completeness, reasonableness, and realism.  In accordance with FAR 15.404, Proposal Analysis, the Government may include a cost realism
   analysis to determine what the Government should realistically expect to pay for the proposed effort, the offeror's understanding of the work,
   and the offeror's ability to perform the contract.  Profit or fee will be evaluated and negotiated based on risk and shall not exceed
   statutory limits in accordance with FAR provision 15.404-4 and 15.404-4(b)(i), respectively, for the initial Task Order 0001 and each
   subsequent task order issued against the Basic IDIQ contract.  In addition, a weighted guidelines analysis will be conducted to ensure fair
   and reasonable fee or profit.


     i. Completeness Factor: The Government will evaluate each cost/pricing proposal for completeness by determining the adequacy and
        traceability of cost/pricing data provided for all proposal requirements.  For the cost data to be complete, the offeror, or their
        subcontractors or vendors, must provide all the data necessary to support the offer (as shown in Table 8.2).  The amount of data needed
        may vary depending on the requirements.


    ii. Reasonableness Factor: The Government will evaluate how well each offeror’s proposal supports elements of cost, work hours, Full-Time
        Equivalents (FTE’s) calculations, proposed direct rate derivation, loading factors and direct/indirect rates over the life of the
        proposed contract.  Proposed rates and factors and the development of those factors will also be verified with the Defense Contract
        Audit Contractor (DCAA) via rate checks or formal audits, as appropriate.  For the cost to be reasonable, in its nature, development and
        amount, it should not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of a competitive business. This represents
        a compromise between the seller's and the buyer's opinion of what constitutes a fair price. Reasonableness takes into account the
        context of a given source selection, including current market conditions, industry standards and other factors that affect the ability
        of an offeror to perform the contract requirements. What is reasonable depends upon a variety of considerations and circumstances,
        including (but not limited to):

            • Whether it is the type of cost generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the offeror's business or of the
              contract performance;
            • Generally accepted sound business practices, Federal and State laws and regulations, etc.; and,
            • Any significant deviations from the offeror's established practices.


   iii. Realism Factor: In accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d), the Government will perform a cost realism analysis by independently reviewing and
        estimating the specific elements of each offeror’s proposed cost/price estimate to determine whether the estimated costs and prices are
        realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of proposal requirements, and are consistent with the methods of
        performance described in the offeror’s technical proposals.  A cost realism analysis will be used to determine the probable cost of
        performance for each offeror.  The probable cost will be determined by adjusting each offeror’s proposed cost, and fee when appropriate
        to reflect any additions or reductions in cost elements to realistic levels based on the results of the cost realism analysis.

                  For the cost to be realistic, it must reflect what it would cost the offeror to perform the
                  effort, if performed with reasonable economy and efficiency. Cost realism evaluation
                  includes a review of the overall costs in the offeror's proposal to determine:

            • If costs are realistic for the work proposed;
            • If costs reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and
            • If costs are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's management proposal, (e.g., if the offeror's proposal
              identifies 25 staff-years of effort, then the estimated costs/prices should also reflect 25 staff-years of cost).
        The evaluation will be based on an analysis of the cost data, the traceability of the     cost to the offeror's capability data and the
        proposed allocation of man-hours and labor mix. Pertinent cost information, including but not limited to DCAA recommended rates for such
        costs as direct labor, overhead, G&A, and other indirect rates, as necessary and appropriate, will be used to arrive at the Government
        determination of the most probable cost to be incurred in the performance of this contract. If proposed costs are considered to be
        unrealistic, including unrealistic labor and indirect rates or the development thereof, the offeror's proposed costs may be adjusted
        upward or downward to reflect more realistic costs. The burden of proof for cost credibility rests with the offeror. Offerors are
        cautioned that to the extent proposed costs appear unrealistic; the Government may infer either a lack of understanding of the
        requirements, increased risk of performance, or lack of credibility on the part of the offeror.

|                        |Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements.        |
|                        |Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance.  Risk of   |
|Acceptable              |unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.                                                          |
|                        |Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding  |
|                        |of the requirements.  The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths.  Risk of    |
|Marginal                |unsuccessful performance is high.                                                                            |
|Unacceptable            |Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies.  Proposal is not awardable.       |



**Note: A proposal that receives an “unacceptable” rating for Factors 1, 3, or Sub-factors 3a, 3b, or 3c will result in the entire proposal
being determined “unacceptable.” No further evaluation of the proposal shall be performed. (i.e. past performance or cost proposal submission)
and the offeror will not be considered for award.

IV.  Evaluation Definitions

Use the following definitions in your assessment of contractor performance.

|EXCEPTIONAL                          |Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government’s benefit.  The         |
|                                     |contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with few minor  |
|                                     |problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.                  |
|VERY GOOD                            |Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government’s benefit.  The         |
|                                     |contractual performance of the element or sub-element being assessed was accomplished with some minor |
|                                     |problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.                         |
|SATISFACTORY                         |Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element or sub-element|
|                                     |contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were      |
|                                     |satisfactory.                                                                                         |
|MARGINAL                             |Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element  |
|                                     |or sub-element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet         |
|                                     |identified corrective actions.  The contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or |
|                                     |were not fully implemented.                                                                           |
|UNSATISFACTORY                       |Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.|
|                                     |The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious problem(s) for which the |
|                                     |contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective.                                           |
