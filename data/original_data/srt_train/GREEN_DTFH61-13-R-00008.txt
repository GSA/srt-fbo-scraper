PROPOSAL SUBMISSION	



Electronic transmissions of pre-proposals shall be sent to  and to the Contract Specialist,  no later than 11:00 a.m. EST, on April 12, 2013.  Proposals received after this date and time will not be considered.



Offerors selected for submission of full proposals will be notified by the Contract Specialist and the due date and time for submission of full proposals will be identified.



All questions pertaining to BAA DTFH61-13-R-00008 shall be forwarded to the Contract Specialist via email at the email address provided above. Responses to all questions received prior to 11:00 a.m. EST on March 13, 2013 will be answered in an amendment to the BAA and posted on FedBizOps. 

			

AWARD TYPE



The FHWA may award either contracts or cooperative agreements as a result of this BAA.  In consultation with the technical evaluators, the Contracting Officer will make the determination whether a contract or cooperative agreement will be awarded. Three factors affect the decision to award a procurement contract or assistance award, and if an assistance award, a grant or cooperative agreement.  The three factors are:



Legislative authority

Principal purpose

Degree of federal involvement



Assistance agreements differ from contracts in several key ways: 



The primary goal of a procurement contract is to procure goods or services for the use of or to directly benefit the federal awarding agency; the primary goal of an assistance agreement is to further a public purpose. 



Procurement contracts allow for the vendor/supplier to make a profit, while assistance agreements are cost-reimbursable agreements in that the only permissible charges are actual costs that are directly related to the project and an amount of indirect costs based on an agreed-upon rate. 



Procurement contracts require “deliverables” that the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer Representative (CO/COR) must test and accept; assistance agreements do not include deliverables, but may require other submissions described in the award document.



Although the Government encourages cost sharing for both cooperative agreements and contracts, all applications submitted for cooperative agreement or grant consideration shall include a 50 percent or greater non-federal cost share, as required by Section 5101(b) of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy For Users (SAFETEA-LU). 



PROGRAM SCOPE



This program focuses on innovative solutions that maximize user flexibility and options while implementing requirements of Traffic Noise Model (TNM) v3.0. offerors should become familiar with the FHWA TNM to increase the likelihood of a successful proposal. In preparation of offerors developing their pre-proposals, the offerors may download previous versions of TNM, user manual and technical manual at 

. 

 

This project consists of a pre-proposal phase, during which the FHWA solicits ideas from offerors on how to solve the research question; and, a full proposal phase, during which FHWA will invite selected offerors of pre-proposals to submit a full proposal implementing the ideas presented in their pre-proposal. 



DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES 



The FHWA is soliciting proposals to interface the FHWA Traffic Noise Model (TNM) version 3.0 acoustics library within a graphic user interface (GUI) such as computer aided design (CAD) and/or geographic information systems (GIS) software. Users of TNM will use the GUI to digitize project plans for use in developing noise models. The FHWA TNM is a state of the art calculation tool used to model highway noise operating in MS Windows®. 



The objective of this BAA is to facilitate the use of a variety of user interfaces for TNM v3.0 which will facilitate interoperability among design tools used by state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and consultants. As such, FHWA is seeking ideas that may also include interfacing TNM v3.0 with new, open source, or web-based applications. Use of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards located at http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards is encouraged.



Currently, the FHWA requires use of the FHWA TNM v2.5 to projects that require FHWA approval, regardless of funding source, or that is funded with Federal-aid highway funds (23 CFR 772.7(a)). The FHWA distributes the TNM v2.5 free of charge. Completion of this project will result in a requirement to use TNM 3.0 for projects that meet the conditions in 23 CFR 772.7(a).  It is FHWA’s preference to continue offering low or no cost alternatives to TNM users; however, offerors may propose use of TNM v3.0 as an add-on or plug-in for software that requires a fee to license. The FHWA also seeks ideas for use of TNM v3.0 with applications that do not require fee based licenses such as open source and web based applications. The FHWA also encourages solutions offering alternate and multi-platform capability (Windows, OSX, Linux, Android, etc.).



PRE-PROPOSALS



For the pre-proposal phase, offerors shall submit ideas on how to replace the CAD/GIS functionality in TNM v3.0 and improve upon the functionality in the beta interface. Please note that the TNM 3.0 Beta is not complete, however, the TNM 3.0 development team has tested the acoustics in the software to the extent possible. During the pre-proposal phase, the FHWA will make available the TNM 3.0 Beta and the TNM 3.0 Beta source code. For a copy of the TNM v3.0 Beta and/or the TNM v3.0 Beta source code for use in the development of pre-proposals, offerors may send a request to Geopardi Bost at , no later than February 27, 2013. Ms. Bost will respond to requests received via email by the next business day. Offerors must obtain the Manifold 8.0 Professional Runtime to use the TNM v3.0 Beta. This software is available at

. 



FULL PROPOSALS 



The FHWA has an ongoing, related project for the FHWA TNM v3.0 Beta resulting in development of the TNM v3.0 acoustic and persistence libraries and the TNM v3.0 Beta technical manual. The FHWA will provide the current version of the TNM v3.0 technical manual, the TNM v3.0 Beta and the TNM v3.0 Beta source code to offerors selected to submit a full proposal that did not request these items under the pre-proposal phase. The FHWA will also provide separate files that comprise the acoustics library used in TNM 3.0 Beta and a persistence library when they are complete. 



Additionally, the FHWA will provide a current draft version of the consistency test suite to offers selected to submit full proposals. Development of the consistency test suite is a second, ongoing, related project and is expected to be completed in the summer of 2013. The FHWA will provide the final draft version of the consistency test suite to offerors selected for contract award. The test suite includes a variety of analysis cases that final products must use to prove consistency with the methodology of the FHWA TNM in accordance with 23 CFR 772.9(a). Final submissions must demonstrate consistency for acceptance. 



Proposed solutions may incorporate functions from the TNM v3.0 Beta, such as input dialog boxes, barrier design tool and reports. Reference TNM v3.0 Beta and TNM technical guides to see how TNM implements these functions. The FHWA encourages offerors to utilize the code used to incorporate these functions in the TNM v3.0 Beta to the extent practicable. Implementation must occur consistent with TNM v3.0 Beta unless otherwise noted. In addition to the functionality shown in the TNM user and technical guidance documents, offerors must incorporate the following functions and features within their idea. 



A user interface that allows users to open design files in a native file format 

A user interface that allows users to input TNM objects and enter additional information about TNM objects 

The TNM includes several types of objects: 

Line objects (polyline), such as roadways, terrain lines, building rows, and barriers 

Area objects (closed polyline), such as ground zones, tree zones, and contour zones 

Point object (single point), such as receivers

Parallel barrier analysis tool

Functionality to output single or multiple reports in PDF and Excel formats 

Plan view, skew view and perspective view of the noise analysis case

Barrier design tool

Single barrier reflections – this functionality is included in the TNM acoustic code

Enhanced contours – the TNM acoustic code includes functionality for calculation of noise levels; however, the proposed interface must resolve the means to display results graphically. The TNM v2.5 and previous versions displayed noise contours as lines with associated levels. The approach desired by FHWA to display noise contours in TNM v3.0 is with color gradients.

Multi-lane tool – the TNM v3.0 Beta includes a utility that facilitates input of a multi-lane roadway

Import/export functionality – the interface must allow users to import TNM cases in XML, SHP, DXF and DXF3D format as well as georeferenced and unreferenced images to use as a base to digitize noise model cases 

Export functionality – the interface must allow users to import and export TNM cases in XML, SHP, DXF and DXF3D format 

Enhanced Import/Export – the FHWA desires import and export of DGN and DWG files as enhanced features

Demonstrate consistency with TNM through use of the consistency test suite

Documentation for users explaining use of TNM within the proposed software environment



FOCUS AREAS 



There are two focus areas of particular interest to the FHWA. Proposals in both areas are highly encouraged. The following guidance is provided to assist offerors in the development of its proposals. The two focus areas of particular interest to the FHWA are:



Interface the FHWA TNM v3.0 with software users already use



Users of the FHWA TNM v2.5 often use CAD or GIS software to draw the TNM objects on an aerial image or design drawing, convert the applicable layers/levels to DXF format and then import them into TNM for conversion into the applicable TNM objects. Users then use TNM to navigate through dialog boxes for each object type used in a specific case to assign appropriate parameters to the objects such as traffic volume, mix and speed, height and density of building rows, height of barriers, etc. One approach to developing an interface for TNM v3.0 would be to complete all input and analysis work within the CAD/GIS software and use TNM v3.0 solely for calculation and output of reports. The FHWA encourages development of interfaces for ArcGIS, AutoCAD, GeoMedia and Microstation, the standards commonly used by most state DOTs. Offerors may also propose ideas for completing the FHWA TNM v3.0 development within the existing GUI environment. 



Interface the FHWA TNM v3.0 with alternative software



FHWA encourages ideas that use open source, royalty free or web-based software to interface with TNM v3.0. Several robust applications show potential for integration with TNM v3.0.FHWA is particularly interested in ideas that would enable continued distribution of TNM at no cost to users. Web based software such as Google Earth and products by ESRI provide mapping tools to users and may present opportunities for TNM v3.0 implementation. Offerors are encouraged to explore options available through the Open Geospatial Consortium () and publically available applications such as GRASS GIS (). 



In addition, FHWA welcomes ideas for multi-platform implementation of TNM and any additional development needed to implement TNM in Linux, OSX, Android or other operating systems. 



DELIVERABLES 



Deliverables for offerors selected to complete work under the full-proposal phase of this announcement will submit:



A full copy of the implementation of the TNM 3.0 within the proposed operating environment; 

The results of the Consistency Test Suite demonstrating consistency with the methodologies of the FHWA TNM pursuant to 23 CFR 772.9(a);

A user’s guide for the TNM 3.0 operating environment. 



GENERAL PROPOSAL INFORMATION 



Direct all correspondence or questions regarding this BAA to the Contract Specialist identified on page 1. FHWA has budgeted approximately $700,000 to fund this research program. The FHWA will evaluate proposals using a two-part process consisting of pre-proposals and full-proposals. FHWA will invite offerors whose pre-proposals are of interest to submit full proposals. FHWA may select for award all, none, or a subset of the acceptable full proposals to construct a balanced program meeting its needs.



FHWA anticipates making multiple cost-reimbursement type awards, typically of 6-12 month duration with the size of individual awards varying from $50,000 to over $150,000 depending on the research area and study requirements. Awards with a total value (including full period of performance and any option periods) of $150,000 or under will be issued as purchase orders. Awards over $150,000 will be issued as contracts, cooperative agreements, or grants. The FHWA strongly encourages cost sharing under any contract that may result, and is able to offer cooperative agreements if the proposer can offer a cost share of 50 percent from non-federal sources of funding. For cooperative agreements, the Federal share of the cost of a project or activity carried out under this program is limited by Section 5101(b) of SAFETEA-LU to fifty (50) percent, unless otherwise determined by the Secretary of Transportation. 



The number of awards, and their dollar value, will vary depending on the merit of proposals received and their potential to lead to successful completion of the program scope. Offerors should prepare proposals with a baseline period of performance of 6-12 months and, if needed, with one or more options for an additional 12-month period of performance. 



NOTE: The FHWA will not reimburse offerors for proposal preparation costs incurred under any phase of this announcement.



FORMAT FOR QUESTIONS  



Each prospective offeror e-mailing questions to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Geopardi Bost should attempt to state each question in such a way that the offeror would have no objection to the FHWA’s publishing that precise question (and its answer) in a formal Amendment to the BAA, on the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE), FedBizOpps.  That is, each prospective offeror should attempt to word each question in such a way that the publication of that question (and its answer) on the GPE would not divulge any information that the prospective offeror considers to be proprietary or confidential.  



All questions regarding this solicitation must be received by Ms. Bost no later than March 13, 2013.  Questions received after the time specified above will not be honored and no responses will be provided. No telephonic requests will be granted, all questions pertaining to the BAA must be emailed.

The Government will evaluate the relevant merits of each offeror’s past performance on the basis of its reputation with its former customers.  The Government may review all or some of the following areas regarding past performance. The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage or disadvantage of the offeror.

Timeliness;

Delivery or Performance;

Problem Responsiveness;

Quality of Purchased Product or Services;

Cost Control; 

Technical Support; and

Delivered Quantities.

In evaluating Past Performance, the Government may consider information provided by offeror’s in their proposal submissions, as well as any other information available to the Government.

 Cost/ Price

 Cost/price will be considered in the ultimate award decision. FHWA will evaluate the offeror’s proposal to determine if the price is fair and reasonable.  Cost proposals will be evaluated to assess realism and probable cost to the Government.  The proposed cost may be adjusted, for the purposes of evaluation, based upon the results of the cost realism analysis.



FHWA encourages proposals that offer significant non-federal matching funds or in-kind resources. 



The evaluation panel will evaluate individual proposal submissions based on the aforementioned evaluation criteria without regard to any other proposal submitted under the announcement. FHWA will accept the offer(s) that provides the greatest overall value to the Government using a tradeoff method of selection. 



GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE PROPOSAL PROCESS 



Proposals may respond to one or more of the subject areas but must indicate which area is primary and which area or areas are subordinate.  Offerors may submit more than one proposal when the proposed effort includes multiple disparate objectives and tasks, covers multiple or disparate technology areas, or would have a more supportable budget if provided in parts. Each proposal submitted will be considered independently. 



Proposals will be evaluated using a two-part process: pre-proposals and full-proposals. The FHWA will evaluate pre-proposals against the evaluation criteria outlined above. Those offerors whose pre-proposals are of interest may be invited to submit a formal full-proposal, as described below. Approximately thirty (30) days following the pre-proposal submission deadline, offerors that submitted pre-proposals will be contacted by the Contracting Officer with a letter informing them either that the FHWA is requesting a formal cost and technical proposal, or that the effort proposed is not of interest to the Government at this time. 



Awards under this program may be subject to the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, depending on the type of final products or reports to be delivered under each award. The Act requires that all electronic products prepared for the Federal Government be accessible to persons with disabilities, including those with vision, hearing, cognitive, and mobility impairments.  Proposers can view Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm) and the Federal IT Accessibility Initiative (Home Page) (http://section508.gov/) for detailed information.
