STATEMENT OF WORK
Website: http://www.greatlakes-seaway.com/en/ I. Purpose

The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (SLSDC) is seeking industry-provided assistance to modernize its Financial Management System (FMS), a legacy information technology (IT) system developed within the SLSDC 20+ years ago. Since its creation, the FMS has been vital in the SLSDC's broad range of financial operations. II. Organizational Summary

The SLSDC is a wholly-owned government corporation and operating administration of the US Department Of Transportation responsible for the operation and maintenance of the U.S. portion of the St. Lawrence Seaway between Montreal, Quebec and Lake Erie. This responsibility includes maintaining and operating the two U.S. Seaway locks as well as vessel traffic control in the areas of the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario. The SLSDC's policy headquarters is located in Washington, D.C., while the operational staff and facilities are located in Massena, N.Y., home of the two U.S. Seaway locks, Eisenhower and Snell. III. Overview of Financial Management at the SLSDC As a federal corporation, the SLSDC is legally required to maintain an independent financial management system. While consistent and reliable, the current iteration of the SLSDC's Financial Management System (FMS) is based on an antiquated information technology (IT) platform, FoxPro for DOS. SLSDC's FMS supports financial operations in the areas of electronic funds transfer, accounts payable and receivable transactions, organization and reporting of investments, General Ledger support, tracking of financial process through the federal procurement cycle, including obligations and accruals, inventory tracking of all SLSDC-owned expendable and permanent property, including depreciation, and real-time reporting of all SLSDC financial data, including budgeting and use of queries. The FMS is an application consisting of numerous "programs" that addresses one or more of the functions listed above, communicating through a shared database architecture. The SLSDC's FMS is minimal in size compared to other IT-based financial solutions, like those used by other Operating Administrations of USDOT, such as the DELPHI system. Currently, no more than 15 users rely on the existing iteration of the FMS. FMS users are currently located in three major office locations, two located in Massena, N.Y. and one in Washington, D.C. Still, several thousand unique transactions take place via the FMS each year. Historic financial data of over 20 years is also managed in the FMS and needs to be preserved in the new system. The FMS has no major problems or glitches significantly hindering the SLSDC's ability to perform its myriad of financial duties. FMS, in its current form, is reliable and has consistently supported the SLSDC's financial business processes over its 20+ year history. Given its technical antiquation, however, the SLSDC is now pursuing this modernization effort to implement a modern and contemporary solution. The SLSDC's desire is to utilize a new technology that improves upon the SLSDC's current financial business processes while maintaining historic informational reliability and financial integrity.

RFP #DTSL55-12-R-C0841 Page 3 of 27 STATEMENT OF WORK (Cont'd) This RFP represents the SLSDC's formal initiation of its effort to modernize the FMS with a more modern IT solution that meets all contemporary federal IT configuration and security standards and requirements. In addition, the SLSDC desires to build upon this new IT system to incorporate current manual business practices including, but not limited to, property management/inventory and purchase requests. The SLSDC also seeks to build this new system on a "cloud" computing platform.

IV. FMS Modernization Project Outlook In order to successfully implement a feasible and modern technology solution that suits its unique organizational and operational environment, the SLSDC is currently seeking offeror-provided support. The offeror must complete the following three tasks as specified in this RFP: a) Complete a thorough analysis of the financial operations and processes of the SLSDC, to improve organizational financial efficiency and to better understand how information technology can improve the SLSDC's financial operations productivity; b) Complete the requirements collection process and prioritize the identified requirements based on the expressed needs of the SLSDC's FMS stakeholders and senior management, to contribute in identifying an available IT system or tool for implementation at the SLSDC; and c) Support the crafting of procurement documents and other related project activities necessary to ensure the successful acquisition of a new system that is technically sophisticated and compatible with the SLSDC's long-term organizational and financial needs. In order to successfully accomplish this task, industry will have to accurately understand, size, describe, and document the SLSDC's financial business processes, including use of the FMS in its current iteration. This includes:

RFP #DTSL55-12-R-C0841 Page 4 of 27 STATEMENT OF WORK (Cont'd) ˇ ˇ ˇ Interviews and analysis across the SLSDC's financial organization with segmentation across FMS users by specific role; Examination of the current architecture, transaction types, and data/history stored within the FMS; and Examination and documentation of the SLSDC's desired system functionality and technical specifications for the modernized FMS.

Expected deliverables stemming from the successful completion of this project include: ˇ ˇ ˇ Ongoing informal communications to engage with the federal project lead via telephone and via email to ensure effective collaboration throughout the project. Biweekly progress reports outlining progress and accomplishments on all tasks, plans for the upcoming period, identify any issues or concerns, and provide an updated project schedule. A summary of costs incurred and budget remaining should also be included. A detailed, professionally developed final report analyzing the SLSDC's current financial business processes, including use of the FMS as well its manual operational activities, written in the context of process improvement, improved organizational financial efficiency, and the use of information technology. A detailed list of specific, actionable recommendations for short-term, medium-term, and long-term financial process improvements attainable by the SLSDC, including identification of any redundancies, fallibilities, or areas of improvement. A detailed requirements analysis and list of all technical requirements needed and desired by the SLSDC to accomplish its vision of procuring a new FMS, to include a prioritization of requirement by list of importance, associated costs, and availability across multiple available IT solutions, as well as guidance and recommendations for a successful implementation. A detailed list of available financial management information technology solutions for the SLSDC to consider in its procurement, including associated costs, available contract vehicles, and other procurement-specific detail. A detailed architectural design and specification schematic outlining the core functionality, look and feel of the proposed technology solution, including any specific source code. A document detailing all short-term, medium-term, and long-term costs associated with implementing a new FMS, to be used for government capital planning support purposes. A presentation, to be delivered in-person, to the SLSDC senior management and other FMS stakeholders highlighting and detailing the findings, recommendations, and other documentation established by the offeror, provided in the context of leveraging recommendations for organizational growth and for identifying a new FMS solution. Various contract-related documents, constructed from a technologically agnostic approach, to aid the SLSDC in completing a thorough, technically savvy, and effective procurement of a new FMS solution, including: o Performance Work Statements, including specific technical requirements identified throughout the project; o Technical Review Criteria matrices and criteria; o Product estimates and other industry service findings, particularly to assist the SLSDC in constructing an Independent Government Cost Estimate; and o Documentation specifying and supporting the SLSDC's timeline and strategy for implementation and realization of a new FMS.

RFP #DTSL55-12-R-C0841 Page 5 of 27 STATEMENT OF WORK (Cont'd) The SLSDC will retain exclusive ownership of all deliverables produced during the project. Final copies of each deliverable should be provided to the SLSDC in electronic and printed formats, as possible. Travel will be required to complete this project. The SLSDC anticipates that approximately three separate trips to its offices in Massena, N.Y. will be necessary. Offerors not located in the National Capital Region will also be required to travel to the SLSDC's offices in Washington, DC at least once. Each visit will likely last approximately four business days per trip. All travel costs should be accounted for in the offeror's cost proposal in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations. The three components identified as work requested within this RFP contribute to a broader vision for implementing a modernized FMS within the SLSDC. Based on its internal market research and preparation work to support this project, the SLSDC envisions the following timeline: ˇ Phase I ­ Initiated as part of this RFP (September 20, 2012 ­ January 31, 2013) ­ IT Requirements Collection ­ Financial Operations Process Analysis ­ Acquisition Support for System/Tool Selection

Additional work in the future may include: ˇ ˇ Phase II (February 1, 2013 ­ June 30, 2013) ­ Acquisition Review of new FMS System/Tool Phase III (July 1, 2013 ­ December 31, 2013) ­ Deployment of new FMS System/Tool, with contributing sub-tasks to include: ˇ User-training ˇ Sunset of legacy FMS ˇ Technical operations and maintenance support during deployment Phase IV (July 1, 2013 ­ Indefinite) ­ Industry-provided Help Desk support for FMS users Phase V (January 1, 2014 ­ March 31, 2014) ­ Authorization and Assessment (A&A)/Certification & Accreditation (C&A) on new system

ˇ ˇ

The SLSDC may require the Contractor's services for support of Phases II and III above. The Contracting Officer may exercise this option by written notice to the Contractor within thirty (30) days of completion of Phase I work.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.
