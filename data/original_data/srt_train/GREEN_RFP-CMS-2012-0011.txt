or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

STATEMENT OF WORK MKS CONSULTING SUPPORT
1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background CMS has implemented a configuration management (CM) process and methodology throughout the enterprise. This required implementing a solution that provided a consistent method for developing quality applications. CMS purchased MKS Integrity Solution as the mid tier software configuration management tool. This tool was recommended based on a study that was conducted to find a tool that worked in the CMS Infrastructure. It satisfied both technical and functional requirements. MKS Integrity Solution has two parts: Source Integrity which provides full version control capabilities and Integrity Manager which automates, manages and enforces processes throughout the entire application development lifecycle. Many of the CMS mid tier applications have been placed under CM control. The CM Team will be migrating all of the remaining legacy mid-tier systems to MKS. In the past years, CMS has obtained the MKS Integrity Product Mentoring per day service via MKS' small business partner, Spectrum Systems. CMS currently has a contract directly with MKS Software, Inc. for this service. 1.2 Purpose The purpose of this contract is to obtain MKS software consultation, training and support services for integration and implementation of CMS Mid-Tier Configuration Management.

11

Solicitation# RFP-CMS-2012-0011

MKS Consulting Support

processed. Investigative packages may contain the following forms: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. SF-85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, 09/1995 SF-85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, 09/1995 OF-612, Optional Application for Federal Employment, 12/2002 OF-306, Declaration for Federal Employment, 01/2001 Credit Report Release Form FD-258, Fingerprint Card, 5/99, and CMS-730A, Request for Physical Access to CMS Facilities (NON-CMS ONLY), 11/2003.

The Contractor personnel shall be required to undergo a background investigation commensurate with one of these position-sensitivity levels: 1) High Risk (Level 6) Public Trust positions that would have a potential for exceptionally serious impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service. This would include computer security of a major automated information system (AIS). This includes positions in which the incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish public confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs, particularly if duties are especially critical to the agency or program mission with a broad scope of responsibility and authority. Major responsibilities that would require this level include: a. development and administration of CMS computer security programs, including direction and control of risk analysis and/or threat assessment; b. significant involvement in mission-critical systems; c. preparation or approval of data for input into a system which does not necessarily involve personal access to the system but with relatively high risk of causing grave damage or realizing significant personal gain; d. other responsibilities that involve relatively high risk of causing damage or realizing personal gain; e. policy implementation; f. higher level management duties/assignments or major program responsibility; or g. independent spokespersons or non-management position with authority for independent action. Approximate cost of each investigation: $3,500 2) Moderate Risk (Level 5) Public Trust positions that have potential for moderate to serious impact on
12

Solicitation# RFP-CMS-2012-0011

MKS Consulting Support

the integrity and efficiency of the service, including computer security. These positions involve duties of considerable importance to the CMS mission with significant program responsibilities that could cause damage to large portions of AIS. Duties involved are considerably important to the agency or program mission with significant program responsibility, or delivery of service. Responsibilities that would require this level include: a. the direction, planning, design, operation, or maintenance of a computer system and whose work is technically reviewed by a higher authority at the High Risk level to ensure the integrity of the system; b. systems design, operation, testing, maintenance, and/or monitoring that are carried out under the technical review of a higher authority at the High Risk level; c. access to and/or processing of information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974; d. assists in policy development and implementation; e. mid-level management duties/assignments; f. any position with responsibility for independent or semi-independent action; or g. delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust. Approximate cost range of each investigation: $150 - $2,600 3) Low Risk (Level 1) Positions having the potential for limited interaction with the agency or program mission, so the potential for impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service is small. This includes computer security impact on AIS. Approximate cost of each investigation: $100 The Contractor shall submit the investigative package(s) to the EMRG within three (3) days after being advised by the EMRG of the need to submit packages. Investigative packages shall be submitted to the following address: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Office of Operations Management Emergency Management & Response Group Mail Stop SL-13-15 7500 Security Boulevard Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850 The Contractor shall submit a copy of the transmittal letter to the Contracting Officer (CO).

Contractor personnel shall submit a CMS-730A (Request for Badge) to the EMRG. The Contractor and the COR shall obtain all necessary signatures on the CMS-730A prior to any Contractor employee arriving for fingerprinting and badge processing. The Contractor must appoint a Security Investigation Liaison as a point of contact to resolve any issues of inaccurate or incomplete form(s). Where personal information is involved, EMRG may need to contact the contractor employee directly. The Security Investigation Liaison may be required to facilitate such contact. After EMRG fingerprints contractor personnel and issues them a temporary CMS identification badge, the EMRG will send their completed investigative package to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM will conduct the background investigation. Badges will be provided by EMRG while contractor personnel investigative forms are being processed. The Contractor remains fully responsible for ensuring contract, task order or delivery order performance pending completion of background investigations of contractor personnel. EMRG shall provide written notification to the CO with a copy to the COR of all suitability decisions. The COR shall then notify the Contractor in writing of the approval of the Contractor's employee(s), at that time the Contractor's employee(s) will receive a permanent identification badge. Contractor personnel who the EMRG determines to be ineligible may be required to cease working on the contract immediately. The Contractor shall report immediately in writing to EMRG with copies to the CO and the COR, any adverse information regarding any of its employees that may impact their ability to perform under this contract, task order or delivery order.

(D&B has no affiliation with this 4character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. "Registered in the CCR database" means that-- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.

The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number-- (i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866705-5711 if located within the United States; or

(5) CMS/HHS Standards, policies and procedures (Section 508) a. Information Technology ­ General Information (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/InfoTechGenInfo/) Connectivity The Contractor shall be required to establish network connectivity to CMS. Contractors who have existing connectivity to CMS through circuits provided on CMSNet (formerly MDCN) may use those circuits to establish connectivity for their employees engaged in work on CMS tasks. All employee workstations communicating with the CMS network shall conform to the CMS standard desktop configuration and abide by the CMS Desktop Features and Specifications. All users shall comply with the HHS Rules of Behavior. Contractors who do not have connectivity to the CMS network, or those who need to provide their employees with remote access to the CMS Baltimore datacenter (BDC), shall provide employees with CMS VPN based remote access over Internet broadband connections. The employee workstation configurations shall comply with the requirements defined in the current version of "VPN Process Instructions For CMS Contractors". These requirements include a CMS standard desktop configuration, an RSA token supported by CMS, a currently patched operating system, current anti-virus software, and a current version of the VPN client used by CMS. If the above connectivity solution does not meet the contractor's requirements or needs, the contractor shall contact their assigned COTR and schedule a kick-off meeting with all parties to discuss the project and networking requirements. This kick-off meeting will also necessitate the COTR and/or GTLs to validate the contractor's authority to gain access to the CMS Network prior to starting the process for acquiring direct circuit connectivity. The following section applies to all organizations which possess or use Federal information, or which operate, use or have access to Federal information systems (whether automated or manual), on behalf of CMS. Information Security The central tenet of the CMS Information Security (IS) Program is that all CMS information and information systems shall be protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, duplication, modification, diversion, destruction, loss, misuse, or theft--whether accidental or intentional. The security safeguards to provide this protection shall be risk-based and business-driven with implementation achieved through a multi-layered security structure. All information access shall be limited based on a least-privilege approach and a need-to-know basis, i.e., authorized user
22

access is only to information necessary in the performance of required tasks. Most of CMS' information relates to the health care provided to the nation's Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and as such, has access restrictions as required under legislative and regulatory mandates. The CMS IS Program has a two-fold purpose: (1) To enable CMS' business processes to function in an environment with commensurate security protections, and (2) To meet the security requirements of federal laws, regulations, and directives. The principal legislation for the CMS IS Program is Public Law (P.L.) 107-347, Title III, Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf. FISMA places responsibility and accountability for IS at all levels within federal agencies as well as those entities acting on their behalf. FISMA directs Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through the Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to establish the standards and guidelines for federal agencies in implementing FISMA and managing cost-effective programs to protect their information and information systems. As a contractor acting on behalf of CMS, this legislation requires that the Contractor shall: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Establish senior management level responsibility for IS, Define key IS roles and responsibilities within their organization, Comply with a minimum set of controls established for protecting all Federal information, and Act in accordance with CMS reporting rules and procedures for IS.

Additionally, the following laws, regulations and directives and any revisions or replacements of same have IS implications and are applicable to all CMS contractors. ˇ P.L. 93-579, The Privacy Act of 1974, http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/privstat.htm , (as amended); ˇ P.L. 99-474, Computer Fraud & Abuse Act of 1986, www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/ccmanual/01cc ma.pdf P.L. 104-13, Paperwork Reduction Act of 1978, as amended in 1995, U.S. Code 44 Chapter 35, www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/paperworkreduction; ˇ P.L. 104-208, Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (formerly known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act), http://www.cio.gov/Documents/it_management_reform_act_ Feb_1996.html;
