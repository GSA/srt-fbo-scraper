2.  Contract or Task Order Title.  Global Combat Support System-Joint (GCSS-J) Data Applications & Integration Analysis Support



3.  Background. GCSS-J is an initiative that provides end-to-end visibility of retail and unit level Combat Support (CS) capability up through National Strategic Level, facilitating information interoperability across and between CS and Command and Control (C2) functions. GCSS-J provides enhanced CS situational awareness to the joint warfighter by integrating CS information into the C2 environment, and facilitating communications between the forward deployed elements and the sustaining bases, ultimately resulting in faster, more efficient decision making by the joint warfighter.  GCSS-J significantly increases access to information stored in disparate databases via a single sign on, web portal application, using a Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) hard tokens.  The GCSS-J infrastructure provides secure web-access, discrete user account administration, data mediation, and enterprise management features that facilitate delivery of capabilities to meet the vision of a net-centric architecture, as well as the integration of information across combat support functional areas. This PWS describes the functions to be performed in supporting these ongoing requirements. 

 

4.  Objectives:  The objective is to provide technical support to the GCSS-J Program Management Office (PMO) with data engineering activities.  Specifically, the contractor shall conduct the following activities during the execution of the contract:  analysis of GCSS-J authoritative and non-authoritative data sources for their ability to satisfy GCSS-J requirements; analysis of GCSS-J Requirements for completeness; quality assurance analysis of GCSS-J authoritative and non-authoritative data sources; query development, which supports the GCSS-J software development effort; and test and evaluation of GCSS-J software products, to ensure software quality assurance and the software’s ability to satisfy the GCSS-J requirements.



5.  Scope.  The contractor shall provide engineering, technical, and program support services required under the task areas as described in Section 6 of this PWS. The scope of this effort will span the breadth of the GCSS-J mission which is to provide enhanced decision support and situational awareness to the warfighter.
