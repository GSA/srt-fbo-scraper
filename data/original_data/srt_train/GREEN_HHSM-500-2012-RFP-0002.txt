The Contractor shall, without charge to the Government, repair or replace the non-compliant products or services within the period of time to be specified by the Government in writing. If such repair or replacement is not completed within the time specified, the Government shall have the following recourses: 1. Cancellation of the contract, delivery or task order, purchase order, or line item without termination liabilities; or 2. In the case of custom EIT being developed by a Contractor for the Government, the Government shall have the right to have any necessary changes made or repairs performed, by itself, or by another firm for the non-compliant EIT, with the Contractor liable for reimbursement to the Government for any expenses incurred thereby. d.

H.7 SECURITY CLAUSE -BACKGROUND - INVESTIGATIONS FOR CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL (CMS CLAUSE 09, MAY 2007)

If applicable, Contractor personnel performing services for CMS under this contract, task order or delivery order shall be required to undergo a background investigation. CMS will initiate and pay for any required background investigation(s). After contract award, the CMS Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and the Security and Emergency Management Group (SEMG), with the assistance of the Contractor, shall perform a position-sensitivity analysis based on the duties contractor personnel shall perform on the contract, task order or delivery order. The results of the position-sensitivity analysis will determine first, whether the provisions of this clause are applicable to the contract and second, if applicable, determine each position's sensitivity level (i.e., high risk, moderate risk or low risk) and dictate the appropriate level of background investigation to be processed. Investigative packages may contain the following forms: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. SF-85, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, 09/1995 SF-85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, 09/1995 OF-612, Optional Application for Federal Employment, 12/2002 OF-306, Declaration for Federal Employment, 01/2001 Credit Report Release Form FD-258, Fingerprint Card, 5/99, and CMS-730A, Request for Physical Access to CMS Facilities (NON-CMS ONLY), 11/2003.

The Contractor personnel shall be required to undergo a background investigation commensurate with one of these position-sensitivity levels: 1) High Risk (Level 6) Public Trust positions that would have a potential for exceptionally serious impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service. This would include computer security of a major automated information system (AIS). This includes positions in which the incumbent's actions or inaction could diminish public confidence in the integrity, efficiency, or effectiveness of assigned government activities, whether or not actual damage occurs, particularly if duties are especially critical to the agency or program mission with a broad scope of responsibility and authority.

31 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
Major responsibilities that would require this level include: a. development and administration of CMS computer security programs, including direction and control of risk analysis and/or threat assessment; b. significant involvement in mission-critical systems; c. preparation or approval of data for input into a system which does not necessarily involve personal access to the system but with relatively high risk of causing grave damage or realizing significant personal gain; d. other responsibilities that involve relatively high risk of causing damage or realizing personal gain; e. policy implementation; f. higher level management duties/assignments or major program responsibility; or g. independent spokespersons or non-management position with authority for independent action. Approximate cost of each investigation: $2,900 2) Moderate Risk (Level 5) Level 5 Public Trust positions include those involving policymaking, major program responsibility, and law enforcement duties that are associated with a "Moderate Risk." Also included are those positions involving access to or control of unclassified sensitive, proprietary information, or financial records, and those with similar duties through which the incumbent can realize a significant personal gain or cause serious damage to the program or Department. Responsibilities that would require this level include: a. the direction, planning, design, operation, or maintenance of a computer system and whose work is technically reviewed by a higher authority at the High Risk level to ensure the integrity of the system; b. systems design, operation, testing, maintenance, and/or monitoring that are carried out under the technical review of a higher authority at the High Risk level; c. access to and/or processing of information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974; d. assists in policy development and implementation; e. mid-level management duties/assignments; f. any position with responsibility for independent or semi-independent action; or g. delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust. Approximate cost of each investigation: $2,400 3) Low Risk (Level 1) Positions having the potential for limited interaction with the agency or program mission, so the potential for impact on the integrity and efficiency of the service is small. This includes computer security impact on AIS.

32 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
Approximate cost of each investigation: $550 The Contractor shall submit the investigative package(s) to SEMG within three (3) days after being advised by the SEMG of the need to submit packages. Investigative packages shall be submitted to the following address: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Office of Operations Management Security and Emergency Management Group Mail Stop SL-13-15 7500 Security Boulevard Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850 The Contractor shall submit a copy of the transmittal letter to the Contracting Officer (CO). Contractor personnel shall submit a CMS-730A (Request for Badge) to the SEMG. The Contractor and the COR shall obtain all necessary signatures on the CMS-730A prior to any Contractor employee arriving for fingerprinting and badge processing. The Contractor must appoint a Security Investigation Liaison as a point of contact to resolve any issues of inaccurate or incomplete form(s). Where personal information is involved, SEMG may need to contact the contractor employee directly. The Security Investigation Liaison may be required to facilitate such contact. SEMG will fingerprint contractor personnel and send their completed investigative package to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM will conduct the background investigation. Badges will not be provided by SEMG until acceptable finger print results are received; until then the contractor employee will be considered an escorted visitor. The Contractor remains fully responsible for ensuring contract, task order or delivery order performance pending completion of background investigations of contractor personnel. SEMG shall provide written notification to the CO with a copy to the COR of all suitability decisions. The COR shall then notify the Contractor in writing of the approval of the Contractor's employee(s), at that time the Contractor's employee(s) will receive a permanent identification badge. Contractor personnel who the SEMG determines to be ineligible may be required to cease working on the contract immediately. The Contractor shall report immediately in writing to SEMG with copies to the CO and the COR, any adverse information regarding any of its employees that may impact their ability to perform under this contract, task order or delivery order.

This clause applies to all organizations which possess or use Federal information, or which operate, use or have access to Federal information systems (whether automated or manual), on behalf of CMS. The central tenet of the CMS Information Security (IS) Program is that all CMS information and information systems shall be protected from unauthorized access, disclosure, duplication, modification, diversion, destruction, loss, misuse, or theft--whether accidental or intentional. The security safeguards to provide this protection shall be risk-based and business-driven with implementation achieved through a multi-layered security structure. All information access shall be limited based on a least-privilege approach and a need-to-know basis, i.e., authorized user access is only to information necessary in the performance of required tasks. Most of CMS' information relates to the health care provided to the nation's Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and as such, has access restrictions as required under legislative and regulatory mandates. The CMS IS Program has a two-fold purpose: (1) To enable CMS' business processes to function in an environment with commensurate security protections, and (2) To meet the security requirements of federal laws, regulations, and directives.

35 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
The principal legislation for the CMS IS Program is Public Law (P.L.) 107-347, Title III, Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMAfinal.pdf. FISMA places responsibility and accountability for IS at all levels within federal agencies as well as those entities acting on their behalf. FISMA directs Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through the Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to establish the standards and guidelines for federal agencies in implementing FISMA and managing costeffective programs to protect their information and information systems. As a contractor acting on behalf of CMS, this legislation requires that the Contractor shall: Ë Ë Ë Ë Establish senior management level responsibility for IS, Define key IS roles and responsibilities within their organization, Comply with a minimum set of controls established for protecting all Federal information, and Act in accordance with CMS reporting rules and procedures for IS.

Additionally, the following laws, regulations and directives and any revisions or replacements of same have IS implications and are applicable to all CMS contractors. Ë P.L. 93-579, The Privacy Act of 1974, http://www.usdoj.gov/oip/privstat.htm , (as amended); Ë P.L. 99-474, Computer Fraud & Abuse Act of 1986, www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/ccmanual/01ccma.pdf P.L. 104-13, Paperwork Reduction Act of 1978, as amended in 1995, U.S. Code 44 Chapter 35, www.archives.gov/federal-register/laws/paperworkreduction; Ë P.L. 104-208, Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (formerly known as the Information Technology Management Reform Act), http://www.cio.gov/Documents/it_management_reform_act_Feb_1996.html; Ë P.L. 104-191, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (formerly known as the Kennedy-Kassenbaum Act) http://aspe.hhs.gov/admnsimp/pl104191.htm; Ë OMB Circular No. A-123, Management's Responsibility for Internal Control, December 21, 2004, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a123/a123_rev.html; Ë OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Transmittal 4, November 30, 2000, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130trans4.html; Ë NIST standards and guidance, http://csrc.nist.gov/; and, Ë Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations, policies, standards and guidance http://www.hhs.gov/policies/index.html These laws and regulations provide the structure for CMS to implement and manage a cost-effective IS program to protect its information and information systems. Therefore, the Contractor shall monitor and adhere to all IT policies, standards, procedures, directives, templates, and guidelines that govern the CMS IS Program, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/informationsecurity and the CMS System Lifecycle

36 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
Framework, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework. The Contractor shall comply with the CMS IS Program requirements by performing, but not limited to, the following: Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Implement their own IS program that adheres to CMS IS policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines, as well as industry best practices; Participate and fully cooperate with CMS IS audits, reviews, evaluations, tests, and assessments of contractor systems, processes, and facilities; Provide upon request results from any other audits, reviews, evaluations, tests and/or assessments that involve CMS information or information systems; Report and process corrective actions for all findings, regardless of the source, in accordance with CMS procedures; Document its compliance with CMS security requirements and maintain such documentation in the systems security profile; Prepare and submit in accordance with CMS procedures, an incident report to CMS of any suspected or confirmed incidents that may impact CMS information or information systems; and Participate in CMS IT information conferences as directed by CMS.

If the contractor believes that an updated IS-related requirement posted to the CMS website may result in a significant cost impact, the contractor may submit a request for equitable cost adjustment before implementing change. H.9 HHSAR 352.242-70 KEY PERSONNEL (JAN 2006)

The key personnel specified in this contract are considered to be essential to work performance. At least 30 days prior to diverting any of the specified individuals to other programs or contracts (or as soon as possible, if an individual must be replaced, for example, as a result of leaving the employ of the Contractor), the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer and shall submit comprehensive justification for the diversion or replacement request (including proposed substitutions for key personnel) to permit evaluation by the Government of the impact on performance under this contract. The Contractor shall not divert or otherwise replace any key personnel without the written consent of the Contracting Officer.

ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST

a. General: The Contractor and the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries and other Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) constituents under this contract should be free of conflicts of interest. Except as consistent with FAR 9.504, the Contracting Officer shall not enter into a contract with an offeror or maintain a contract with a Contractor that the Contracting Officer determines has, or has the potential for, an unresolved conflict of interest. Important Note: Please see Section H.10.c.2.(e) for information pertaining to specific contracting exclusions due to Organizational Conflict of Interest. Please also see Section L.17(c) for information pertaining to potential exclusion from the Eligibility Support competition due to Unequal Access to Information Organizational Conflict of Interest. b. Disclosure: In accordance with section d.1.f, d.2.a below, offerors are required to submit an executed Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificate with their proposal. Contractors must disclose all actual, apparent and potential conflicts of interest to the Contracting Officer during the term of the contract in accordance with paragraph H.10.c. below. The Contractor shall have programs in place to identify, evaluate and mitigate all actual, apparent and potential conflicts of interest that preclude, or would appear to preclude, the Contractor from rendering impartial assistance or advice on work performed for this contract, or the Contractor's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or the Contractor has or obtains an unfair competitive advantage. The Contractor's Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificate, that includes the Contractor's plan to mitigate all actual, apparent and potential conflicts of interest identified during the term of the contract and certification that all work to be performed under this contract is free of unresolved conflicts of interest will be incorporated into the contract after award. (See Attachment J-5) c. Conflict of interest identification: 1. Guidance: While FAR standards are applicable, used in this subpart, the following guidance is provided: (a) Financial relationship includes --

38 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
(1) A direct or indirect ownership or investment interest (including an option or nonvested interest) in any entity that exists through equity, debt, or other means and includes any indirect ownership or investment interest no matter how many levels removed from a direct interest; or A compensation arrangement with an entity.

(2)

(b) Conflict of interest-- Conflict of interest means that because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage. For purposes of the Eligibility Support contract, the activities and relationships described include those of the offeror or Contractor itself and other business related to it and those of officers, directors (including medical directors), managers, and subcontractors. (c) Affiliate Â­ Affiliate means associated business concerns or individuals if, either directly or indirectly-- (1) One controls or can control the other; or, (2) A third party controls or can control both. For purposes of this contract, affiliate control or influence includes, but is not limited to: Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë interlocking management or ownership; identity of interests among family members; shared facilities and equipment; common use of employees; or, a business concern organized just prior to or immediately following, the release of a solicitation or request for information, which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees as the offeror or contractor.

Any business concern may be found to be an affiliate, whether or not it is organized for profit or located in the United States or its outlying areas. Control

39 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the power to control exists. 2. Identification of conflict: (a) The Contracting Officer determines that an offeror or Contractor has a conflict of interest, or the potential for the conflict exists, if(1) The offeror or Contractor is an entity described in paragraph H.10.c.2.c of this section; or (2) The offeror or Contractor has a present, or establishes a future, direct or indirect financial relationship with an entity described in paragraph H.10.c.2.c of this section. (b) A financial relationship may exist either-- (1) Through an offeror's or Contractor's parent company, subsidiaries, affiliates, subcontractors, or current clients; or (2) From the activities and relationships of the officers, directors (including medical directors), or managers of the offeror or Contractor and may be either direct or indirect. An officer, director, or manager has an indirect financial relationship if an ownership or investment interest is held in the name of another but provides benefits to the officer, director, or manager. Examples of indirect financial relationships are, but are not limited to, holdings in the name of a spouse or dependent child of the officer, director, or manager and holdings of other relatives who reside with the officer, director, or manager. (c) For the purpose of identifying entities with conflicts of interest above, the entity is one that is engaged in or is affiliated, as that term is defined in H.10.c.1 above, with the Â­ (1) Operation or sale of managed care plans, drug insurance plans, Medicare supplemental insurance plans or policies, durable medical equipment products or services, dialysis services, or any other related provider and health plan issuer's products or services; (2) Sale of commercial products or services targeted at populations covered by Medicare and other CMS programs e.g., retirement time-share vacations, etc.; and, (3) Independent review or assessment, for the government, of the performance or effectiveness of the operations under the Eligibility Support contract.

40 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
(d) The Contracting Officer may determine that an offeror or Contractor has a conflict of interest, or the potential for a conflict exists, based on the following or on other factors: (1) Apparent conflicts of interest. An apparent conflict of interest exists if a person believes that the offeror or Contractor would have a conflict of interest in performing the requirements of a contract under this subpart. No inappropriate action by the offeror or Contractor is necessary for an apparent conflict of interest to exist. (2) Other contracts and grants. (e) Contracting Exclusions/Restrictions: (1) The services performed by the Contractor include the intake, routing, review, and troubleshooting of applications that will become the basis for Exchange appeals. Exchange appeals will be conducted under a separate CMS contract entitled "Eligibility Appeals." An exclusion for contracting is necessary to ensure an independent and objective review of eligibility determinations and to ensure that the Contractor will take the necessary steps to prevent disclosure of information under this contract. In accordance with FAR 9.5, the Contractor (and any subcontractors or consultants partnering with the Contractor) for this Eligibility Support contract will be excluded from serving as either the prime contractor or a subcontractor on the Eligibility Appeals contract and/or any other contract or task order that involves appeals under the federally-facilitated Exchange until the end of this contract. (2) The services solicited in this request for proposal support the FFE and SBEs for the Eligibility Support tasks under the Affordable Care Act. The tasks in the associated Statement of Work include the intake, routing, review, and troubleshooting of applications submitted for enrollment into a QHP and for insurance affordability programs including, but not limited to, Advance Payment of Premium Tax Credits, Cost-Sharing Reductions, Medicaid, CHIP, and the Basic Health Program (where applicable), beginning on October 1, 2013. Contractors that are working on or have worked on contracts awarded by CMS to build systems that collect and process Eligibility verifications and Enrollment transactions and/or build systems that integrate with the FFE to facilitate Eligibility verifications and Enrollment transactions have been given access to all or nearly all of CMS' Eligibility and Enrollment information. That knowledge provides those contractors with unequal access to information that affords them an unfair competitive advantage. In accordance with FAR 9.5, any offeror that meets the above description is ineligible to receive consideration for award as a prime contractor, subcontractor, and consultant or in any other role. Note: After contract award and for the duration of this contract, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to consider approval of
41 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
any proposed subcontractor/consultant/vendor that has done work as described above, and would otherwise be excluded under this subsection. 3. Offeror's or Contractor's responsibility with regard to subcontractors. An offeror or Contractor is responsible for identifying whether a conflict of interest exists in any of its proposed or actual subcontractors at any tier and is responsible for ensuring that the subcontractors have mitigated any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest. This information shall be submitted with the proposal the same as the offeror's conflict information. The Contracting Officer shall be notified of such identifications in accordance with H.10.b. The Contractor shall maintain documentation necessary to support its conclusion that its subcontractors have mitigated any conflict or potential conflict. A Contractor may require its subcontractors to follow the procedures for identifying, evaluating and disclosing conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest as contained herein. 4. Post-award conflicts of interest. (a) In addition to the conflicts identified in this section regardless of when such conflict may arise, the Contracting Officer considers that a conflict of interest has occurred if during the term of the contract-- (1) The Contractor receives any fee, compensation, gift, payment of expenses, or any other thing of value from any entity that is reviewed or contacted during the normal course of performing activities under the Eligibility Support contract; or (2) The Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor's activities are creating a conflict of interest. (b) In the event the Contracting Officer determines that a conflict of interest exists during the term of the contract, the Contracting Officer may take action including, but not limited to: (1) Not renewing the contract for an additional term; (2) Modifying the contract; or (3) Terminating the contract. d. Conflict of interest evaluation: 1. Disclosure. Offerors that wish to be eligible for the award of the Eligibility Support contract under this subpart and the Eligibility Support contractor, must submit, at times specified in paragraph H.10.d.2. of this section, an Organizational Conflicts of Interest Certificate. The Certificate must contain the information specified in paragraphs H.10.d.1 (a) through (h) of this section as follows:
42 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
(a) A description of all business or contractual relationships or activities that the Contractor's compliance officer has determined could be viewed as a conflict of interest. (b) A description of the methods the offeror or Contractor will apply to mitigate any situations listed in the Certificate that could be identified as a conflict of interest. (c) A description of the offeror's or Contractor's program to monitor its compliance and the compliance of its proposed and actual subcontractors with the conflict of interest requirements as identified in the relevant solicitation. (d) A description of the offeror's or Contractor's plans to contract with an independent auditor to conduct an annual conflict of interest audit. (e) A description of all healthcare related contracts both government (local, state or federal) and nongovernment to include contracts with CMS and other government health care agencies held by the Contractor, its parent company, subsidiaries or other affiliated entities. (f) An affirmation, using language provided below, signed and dated by an official authorized to bind the Contractor: I, (Name and Title), certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief: 1) I am an official authorized to bind the entity; 2) the information contained in the Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificate is true and accurate as of (Date); and 3) I understand that the Contracting Officer may consider any deception or omission in this Certificate to be grounds for non-consideration for contract award, modification or nonrenewal or termination of the current contract, and/or other contract or legal action. An offeror shall submit an affirmation certifying the information to be true and accurate as of the date the proposal is submitted. Upon award, the Contractor shall submit an updated affirmation, if necessary, certifying the information to be accurate as of the date of contract award. (g) Corporate and organizational structure. (h) Financial interests in other entities, including the following: (1) Percentage of ownership in any other entity. (2) Income generated from other sources. (3) A list of current or known future contracts or arrangements, regardless of size, with any-(i) Insurance organization or subcontractor of an insurance organization; or (ii) Providers or suppliers furnishing health services for which payment may be made under Medicare and other CMS programs. (4) In the case of contracts or arrangements identified in accordance with paragraph H.10.3.d.1(h)(3) of this section, the dollar amount of the contracts

(2) The information specified in paragraphs H.10.d.1 (h)(1) and (2) of this section. 2. When disclosure is made. The Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificate is submitted-- (a) With the offeror's proposal; (b) When the Contracting Officer requests a revision in the Certificate; (c) Within 45 days of any change in the information submitted in accordance with paragraph H.10.d.1 of this section. (d) As part of the annual conflict of interest certification by an independent auditor. The first annual certification shall be submitted on the anniversary date that the contract became fully operational and annually thereafter. 3. Evaluation. The Contracting Officer evaluates conflicts of interest and potential conflicts, using the information provided in the Conflicts of Interest Certificate, and information from other sources. For each conflict identified, the Contracting Officer will evaluate the plan proposed to mitigate the conflict to determine if the mitigation plan will allow the Contractor to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government; or the Contractor's objectivity in performing the contract work is not or will not be otherwise impaired; or the Contractor will not or has not obtained an unfair competitive advantage. e. Conflict of Interest Resolution: Resolution of a conflict of interest is a determination that: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) The conflict has been mitigated; The conflict precludes award of a contract to the offeror; The conflict requires that the Contracting Officer modify an existing contract; The conflict requires that the Contracting Officer terminate an existing contract; or It is in the best interest of the Government to contract with the offeror or Contractor even though the conflict exists.

In compliance with the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, and the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4), this clause identifies the classes of service employees expected to be employed under the contract and states the wages and fringe benefits payable to each if they were employed by the contracting agency subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5341 or 5332.

FAR 52.222-49 SERVICE CONTRACT ACT - PLACE OF PERFORMANCE UNKNOWN (MAY 1989)

(a) This contract is subject to the Service Contract Act, and the place of performance was unknown when the solicitation was issued. In addition to places or areas identified in wage determinations, if any, attached to the solicitation, wage determinations have also been requested for the following: [TBD]. The Contracting Officer will request wage determinations for additional places or areas of performance if asked to do so in writing by [15 calendar days after release of solicitation].

54 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
(b) For purposes of the salary rate limitation, the terms "direct salary," "salary," and "institutional base salary," have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as "direct salary," in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's direct effort (costs) under the contract. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor. Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs). Note: The salary rate limitation does not restrict the salary that an organization may pay an individual working under an HHS contract or order; it merely limits the portion of that salary that may be paid with contract funds. (c) The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals under subcontracts. If this is a multipleyear contract or order, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract or order funding. (d) See the salaries and wages pay tables on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Web site for Federal Executive Schedule salary levels that apply to the current and prior periods. I.11 HHSAR 352.237-73 NON-DISCRIMINATION IN SERVICE DELIVERY (MAR 2012)

By acceptance of this contract, the Contractor agrees to comply with this policy in supporting the program and in performing the services called for under this contract. The Contractor shall include this clause in all sub-contracts awarded under this contract for supporting or performing the specified program and services. Accordingly, the Contractor shall ensure that each of its employees, and any sub-contractor staff, is made aware of, understands, and complies with this policy.

As used in this provision-- "Discussions" are negotiations that occur after establishment of the competitive range that may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, result in the offeror being allowed to revise its proposal. "In writing," "writing," or "written" means any worded or numbered expression that can be read, reproduced, and later communicated, and includes electronically transmitted and stored information. "Proposal modification" is a change made to a proposal before the solicitation's closing date and time, or made in response to an amendment, or made to correct a mistake at any time before award.

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
"Proposal revision" is a change to a proposal made after the solicitation closing date, at the request of or as allowed by a Contracting Officer as the result of negotiations. "Time," if stated as a number of days, is calculated using calendar days, unless otherwise specified, and will include Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. However, if the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, then the period shall include the next working day. (b) Amendments to solicitations. If this solicitation is amended, all terms and conditions that are not amended remain unchanged. Offerors shall acknowledge receipt of any amendment to this solicitation by the date and time specified in the amendment(s). (c) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals. (1) Unless other methods (e.g., electronic commerce or facsimile) are permitted in the solicitation, proposals and modifications to proposals shall be submitted in paper media in sealed envelopes or packages (i) addressed to the office specified in the solicitation, and (ii) showing the time and date specified for receipt, the solicitation number, and the name and address of the offeror. Offerors using commercial carriers should ensure that the proposal is marked on the outermost wrapper with the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this provision. (2) The first page of the proposal must show-- (i) The solicitation number; (ii) The name, address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the offeror (and electronic address if available); (iii) A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and agreement to furnish any or all items upon which prices are offered at the price set opposite each item; (iv) Names, titles, and telephone and facsimile numbers (and electronic addresses if available) of persons authorized to negotiate on the offeror's behalf with the Government in connection with this solicitation; and (v) Name, title, and signature of person authorized to sign the proposal.

(3) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.

74 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
(i) Offerors are responsible for submitting proposals, and any modifications or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that proposal or revision is due. (ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-- (1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or (3) It is the only proposal received. (B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. (iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. (iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the

75 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. (v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award.

(7) (8)

(d) Offer expiration date. Proposals in response to this solicitation will be valid for the number of days specified on the solicitation cover sheet (unless a different period is proposed by the offeror). (e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data (HHSAR 352.215-1 Authorized FAR deviation). As prescribed in HHSAR 315.209, FAR 52.215-1 is modified as follows (1) The proposal submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade secrets; business data, e.g., commercial information, financial

76 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
information, and cost and pricing data; and technical data) which the offeror, including its prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal. The use and disclosure of any data may be so restricted; provided, that the Government determines that the data is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, and the offeror marks the cover sheet of the proposal with the following legend, specifying the particular portions of the proposal which are to be restricted in accordance with the conditions of the legend. The Government's determination to withhold or disclose a record will be based upon the particular circumstances involving the record in question and whether the record may be exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The legend reads: "Unless disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, (the Act) as determined by Freedom of Information (FOI) officials of the Department of Health and Human Services, data contained in the portions of this proposal which have been specifically identified by page number, paragraph, etc. by the offeror as containing restricted information shall not be used or disclosed except for evaluation purposes. The offeror acknowledges that the Department may not be able to withhold a record (data, document, etc.) nor deny access to a record requested pursuant to the Act and that the Department's FOI officials must make that determination. The offeror hereby agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure if the Department has determined that disclosure is required by the Act. If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this proposal, the Government shall have right to use or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract. Proposals not resulting in a contract remain subject to the Act. The offeror also agrees that the Government is not liable for disclosure or use of unmarked data and may use or disclose the data for any purpose, including the release of the information pursuant to requests under the Act. The data subject to this restriction are contained in pages (insert page numbers, paragraph designations, etc. or other identification)."

77 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
(2) In addition, the offeror should mark each page of data it wishes to restrict with the following statement: "Use or disclosure of data contained on this page is subject to the restriction on the cover sheet of this proposal or quotation." (3) Offerors are cautioned that proposals submitted with restrictive legends or statements differing in substance from the above legend may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the right to reject any proposal submitted with a nonconforming legend. (End of HHSAR Deviation)

(f)

Contract award. (1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation. (2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government's interest. (3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received. (4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals (5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.

78 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government's best interest to do so. Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government. The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government. If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.

(7) (8)

(9)

(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. (11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable[, in accordance with FAR 15.506]: (i) The agency's evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror's offer. (ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror. (iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection. (iv) A summary of the rationale for award. (v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror. (vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

e) The offeror understands that: (1) No contract will be awarded unless and until an acceptable plan is negotiated with the Contracting Officer. Such plan will be incorporated into the contract, as a material part thereof. (2) An acceptable plan must, in the determination of the Contracting Officer, provide the maximum practicable opportunity for small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged persons to participate in the performance of the contract. (3) If a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer is not negotiated within the time limits prescribed by the contracting activity and such failure arises out of causes within the control and with the fault or negligence of the offeror, the offeror shall be ineligible for an award. The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the reasons for determining a subcontracting plan unacceptable early enough in the negotiation process to allow the Contractor to modify the plan within the time limits prescribed.

(version 2003 or 2007). However, in any case where a portion of the offeror's proposal is sent in Microsoft Project it must be accompanied by a PDF document that includes the same information. Offerors are hereby advised that the place for submission of proposals (CMS Single Site at 7500 Security Blvd, Baltimore (Woodlawn), Maryland), is a secure building. Proposal delivery must be made to the exact location stated in this solicitation on or before the date and time specified. Offerors are also advised to make sure that the proposal is clearly marked as to: Ë Ë Ë Ë The RFP number, The date and time for receipt, The intended recipient, and The telephone number of the intended recipient.

For hand delivered proposals, offerors shall enter the CMS single site facility through the North Gate--Dogwood Road. For security purposes offerors shall contact the Contract Specialist via email at CCIIO_Eligibility_Support@cms.hhs.gov with the following information: Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Delivery personnel name Year, make, and model of delivery vehicle Vehicle license plate number Approximate number of boxes Anticipated date and time of delivery

The above information should be received by the Contract Specialist at least 24 hours prior to delivery.

Personnel will be asked to verify the above information at the North Gate-Dogwood Road prior to entering the CMS complex. Upon verification, the delivery vehicle will be directed to the CMS warehouse, where proposals will be received. Offerors may, at a minimum, be subject to a vehicle search and all packages/boxes and their contents may be opened and searched prior to entering the CMS complex. Offerors are cautioned that hand-delivered proposals are considered "received" by CMS when the offeror receives a signed receipt by the Contract Specialist or Contracting

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
Officer or their designee indicating the time and date of proposal receipt, which, if following the above guidance, will take place at the CMS warehouse. Proposal delivery by a mail carrier service other than the U.S. Postal Service are not accepted in the CMS mailroom and therefore, offerors' proposals may not be delivered timely to the location and person specified in this solicitation. Offerors are reminded that FAR 52.215-1 does not make allowance for proposals received late when submitted by mail services other than the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service. Offerors are advised to take that possibility into consideration in determining when and how a proposal must be received at the specified location to meet the date and time requirements. The prime contractor is responsible for tracking the submissions of any proposed subcontracts in the event that the subcontractors find a need to submit business information under separate cover. It is the responsibility of the prime contractor in its Executive Summary and its Technical Submission to clearly identify ALL proposed subcontractors. It is the responsibility of the prime contractor to ensure timely submission of separate subcontractor proposals. While subcontractor pricing proposals may be evaluated if received late, the government may consider this lack of responsibility to be a significant weakness in the area of program management and this may be reflected in the evaluation of that criteria. NOTE: For the purposes of this procurement, the Government is accepting ONLY hard copy submissions, no electronic submissions and no facsimile submissions. b. Binding and Labeling - All proposals shall be in locking 3 ring binders. A binder cover sheet shall be affixed to each volume, which clearly identifies each volume, volume number, copy number (e.g. copy 2 of 10), the Request for Proposal (RFP) identification, and offeror's name. If the material for a volume requires more than one book, then that volume shall be labeled with the name and number of the volume and book number, i.e., Written Technical Proposal, Volume III, Book 1 of 2. The original of Volumes I, II and III shall be marked ORIGINAL and all other copies shall be marked COPY. c. Indexing - TAB indexing shall be used to identify all sections. Each volume shall be organized such that an extensive search of required documents is not necessary to review the proposal. d. Page Size, Typing, Spacing and Page Numbering - Page size shall be 8 Ë by 11 inches. Fold-outs will count as two pages. The proposal shall be numbered. Please print on both sides if possible. Submit proposals, to the extent possible, on high grade white paper

c. Information Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data Certified cost or pricing data is not required; however, CMS is requesting information other than certified cost or pricing data in order to establish a fair and reasonable price and cost realism. Data shall be provided in accordance with FAR 52.215-20 (Alt IV). 1. General Pricing Instructions The Business Proposal shall set forth the offeror's proposed price on a CPFF basis. The offeror shall submit a written narrative and Attachment J-8, Eligibility Support Pricing Template, as part of its Business Proposal. The offeror shall provide in the written narrative any explanations the offeror deems necessary for the Government to understand the derivation of the pricing proposed. The offeror shall provide its proposed pricing in the format specified in Attachment J-8 to the solicitation. This shall include all costs and fees anticipated for all phases of operation (i.e., transition and full operations). On the CD/DVD submitted with the Business Proposal, the offeror shall retitle this worksheet as "Offeror Name_Pricing Worksheet." Application volumes and other variables impacting the size and scope of eligibility support operations are currently unknown. Therefore, to ensure consistency in the derivation of offerors' proposed pricing, this RFP provides pricing assumptions to be used by all offerors for bidding purposes. Where numerical assumptions are provided by the Government in this RFP (e.g., labor hours, travel costs, ODCs), the offeror shall use these assumptions to derive its proposed pricing. Offerors may have accounting systems which treat certain activities designated in the pricing template as indirect vs. direct costs or may have an organizational structure which would not allow them to easily segregate costs into a direct cost element as defined in the pricing structure spreadsheets. Therefore, offerors may present costs for only those line items with identifiable direct costs. For those items not separately priced, insert "N/A," provide a narrative description as to why the line item is labeled "N/A" and how costs for that activity are being accounted for in the proposal. 2. Eligibility Support Pricing Template Instructions The purpose of Attachment J-8, Eligibility Support Pricing Template, is to ensure consistency and transparency in the derivation of offerors' proposed pricing. This requires the offeror to show the break-out of the cost elements used in the derivation of proposed pricing. Categories and amounts are required for the entire contract period, including for the base period and all option periods. Attachment J-8 is comprised of 17 individual tabs as follows:

Offerors shall follow the instructions below when completing Attachment J-8: General Guidelines a) Formulas: Where data was derived or estimated, the offeror must show formulas that are clearly visible in the individual cells and verifiable. The offeror shall include formulas for cumulative totals, subtotals, and grand totals as necessary for labor hours, FTEs, costs, and other items. b) Links: The offeror may link cells between worksheets or workbooks on the condition that all linked reference files are submitted with the proposal. The workbooks must not contain any macros or hidden cells. The Government will not accept pasted values where formulas must be shown; if the offeror employs pasted values under these circumstances, this may delay the offeror's proposal evaluation. c) Supportive Narratives: The offeror shall provide supportive narratives to explain where a data field in the pricing template is left blank or has $0 price.

92 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
Tabs 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 Â­ Required Tasks For the base period and each option period, the offeror shall provide all costs associated with performing the following required tasks as described in the Statement of Work: Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Task 1, Paper Intake and Forms Processing Task 2, Support Processing of Paper Applications Task 3, Support Verification of Information Task 4, Complex Issue Resolution Task 5, Limited Telephone Support Task 6, Mass Changes Task 7, Standard Operating Procedures Task 8, Training and Coordination Task 9, Performance, Quality Assurance and Data Analytics Task 10, Program Management

Please note that the offeror does not need to provide separate cost and pricing data for each required task. a) Labor: The offeror shall propose direct labor costs as specified below: Labor Categories and Hours: The Government has specified the labor categories and labor hours to be used by offerors for pricing purposes. For bidding purposes, the offeror shall use the labor categories and hours pre-populated in Attachment J-8 and also provided in Attachment J-9, Eligibility Support Level of Effort Assumptions, to derive its total estimated direct labor costs. The offeror shall not change the specified labor categories and associated levels of effort. Labor Rates: The offeror shall provide the unburdened labor rates associated with each labor category. The offeror's proposed labor rates shall be supported with payroll information, letters of commitment, and salary survey information. If the labor rates are escalated, the offeror shall provide a rationale for the proposed escalation rate. Labor rate escalation will not be dictated by the Government. That is a business decision for the offeror. Labor rate escalation impacts whether a contractor can recruit and retain qualified staff. The Government will likely use Global Insights forecasting information to inform its analysis of proposed labor rate escalation. Offerors must state their proposed escalation rates utilized in determining the labor projections for option years and if significant deviations from Global Insights are proposed, provide the rationale as to why such deviations would be warranted and are realistic to recruit and retain qualified staff.

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
Key Personnel: The offeror shall designate Key Personnel with a "Yes" or "No" in the "Key Personnel" column. Subcontractors: Any subcontractor labor shall be listed in the worksheets in the "Prime/Sub" column and should clearly indicate which subcontractor is associated with each applicable labor category. If a labor category pertains to both the prime contractor and its subcontractor(s), separate lines should be added to clearly delineate which labor hours, FTEs, and costs relate to the prime contractor versus the subcontractor(s). Total labor hours, FTEs, and costs should be shown in separate line items for the prime contractor and each of its subcontractors as reflected in the worksheets. Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs): The offeror must provide FTEs associated with each proposed labor category. The offeror shall clearly note the annual productive labor hours used for their FTE (e.g., 1,920 hours). Total Labor Cost: The offeror must provide the total costs associated with each labor category. Total direct labor costs for the prime contractor and each of its subcontractors shall be provided. b) ODCs: For bidding purposes, all ODCs except for facilities costs are specified by the Government and are pre-populated in Attachment J-8. This includes ODCs related to scanners and printers, postage, training, and video teleconferencing. The offeror shall not change the specified cost amounts for ODCs and shall include these costs within its proposed CPFF. Details concerning ODCs will be agreed upon after contract award. For bidding purposes, the offeror shall assume that all ODCs would be incurred by the prime contractor. c) Travel: For bidding purposes, travel costs are specified by the Government and are pre-populated in Attachment J-8. The offeror shall not change the specified cost amounts for travel and shall include these costs within its proposed CPFF. Details concerning the actual number of trips, number of travelers, and destinations will be agreed upon after contract award. For bidding purposes, the offeror shall assume that all travel would be performed by the prime contractor. d) Facilities: The offeror shall propose facilities costs associated with performing the Eligibility Support functions. A separate break-down of proposed facilities costs is required and shall be provided at Tabs 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 in accordance with the instructions detailed below.

The offeror shall clearly delineate the indirect cost rates applicable to the prime contractor versus its subcontractor(s). In the written narrative, the offeror shall explain its organization's overhead structure and detail what is encompassed within their overhead costs. f) Fee: The offeror shall propose a fixed fee for the offeror and a separate fixed fee for its subcontractor(s). The full fee should not be proposed on the subcontractor costs. Also, fee shall not be proposed on the travel or postage costs that are specified by the Government. The offeror shall provide the basis and rationale for the proposed fee as part of the written narrative. Tabs 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 Â­ Optional Tasks For the base period and each option period, the offeror shall provide all costs associated with performing the following optional tasks as described in the Statement of Work: Ë Ë Ë Optional Task 11, Development of Standard Operating Procedures Optional Task 12, Increase in Volume of Exchange Participation Optional Task 13, Increased Volume of Appeals Requests

The Government may exercise any of the optional tasks at its discretion at any time during the period of performance of this contract. For bidding purposes only, the offeror shall provide aggregated cost and pricing data for all three optional tasks, assuming that all three optional tasks would be exercised by the Government simultaneously. Please note that the offeror does not need to provide separate cost and pricing data for each optional task. The "Optional Tasks" worksheets follow the same format as the "Required Tasks" worksheets. Accordingly, the offeror shall follow the instructions detailed above for the "Required Tasks" when preparing the "Optional Tasks" worksheets. Tabs 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 - Facilities For the base period and each option period, the offeror shall provide the total cost for the facilities required to execute the Eligibility Support tasks described in the Statement of Work. Offerors shall complete the chart entitled "Facilities Costs: REQUIRED TASKS" by itemizing facilities costs associated with performing all required tasks (Tasks 1--10).

The facilities costs proposed by the offeror shall include all costs that are required for the Contractor to house all of the people and equipment to perform the Eligibility Support functions. Facilities costs are not to be amortized, but should be reported in the year in which they are expected to occur. Facilities pricing must define the cost elements that comprise the lease or buy pricing and include build out cost and any other direct costs (initial and ongoing). In the narrative portion of its Business Proposal, the offeror may supplement any information provided in Attachment J-8 with additional information to further describe the facilities pricing or lease/buy arrangements. Tab 16 - Summary The Summary worksheet provides a roll-up of all estimated costs and fixed fees associated with the Eligibility Support contract. This includes a break-down by required tasks and optional tasks and by contract period (e.g., base and options). The offeror shall link the totals from Tabs 1 through 15 to the Tab 16 Summary worksheet as appropriate. Tab 17 - Change Tracker Tab 17 provides a record of any changes that are initiated after submission of the offeror's initial proposal. The offeror shall clearly (i) indicate the date each change was initiated, (ii) identify by tab number the worksheet on which the change was made, (iii) describe the change, and (iv) provide a justification for the change. d.

L.17 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATE AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAM ATTESTATION PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS

a. Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificate 1. The offeror shall provide an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Certificate which shall include the disclosure information required by Section H.10.d.1 (a) through (h). Failure to submit the required information may result in an offeror's proposal being deemed unacceptable. NOTE: CMS Compliance Program Guidance can be found on CMS's website at https://www.cms.gov/MedicareContractingReform/Downloads/compliance.pdf. You may wish to consult this guidance when documenting your compliance program for this requirement. 2. When describing the business relationships or activities, and contracts held as required by H.10.d.1, the description shall include at a minimum as applicable:
102 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
a) Identify whether the offeror is a Prime, Subcontractor, parent company, subsidiary, or other affiliated entity b) Contract Number or Other Identifier c) Period of Performance e) Points of Contact (Project Officer and Contracting Officer) f) Cost g) Short Description of Work h) Whether the identified contract, relationship or activity creates any of the following types of OCIs: (1) Unequal Access to Information, (2) Biased Ground Rule, (3) Impaired Objectivity, and/or (4) Other. If a potential organization conflict of interest is identified, the offeror must submit a mitigation plan as required by H.10.d.1. Please use Attachment J-12, Organizational Conflict of Interest Template, to input the specified information. Unequal Access to Information Consists of situations in which a firm has access to nonpublic information as part of its performance of a government contract and where that information may provide the firm a competitive advantage in a later competition for a government contract. Â§ FAR 9.505-4. In these "unequal access to information" cases, the concern is limited to the risk of the firm gaining a competitive advantage; there is no issue of bias. Consists of situations in which a firm, as part of its performance of a government contract, has in some sense set the ground rules for another government contract by, for example, writing the statement of work or the specifications. In theses "biased ground rules" cases, the primary concern is that the firm could skew the competition, whether intentionally or not, in favor of itself. Â§ FAR 9.505-1, 9.505-2. These situations may also involve a concern that the firm by virtue of its special knowledge of the agency's future requirements would have an unfair advantage in the competition for those requirements. Consists of situations where a firm has conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment including but not limited to where a firm's work under one government contract could entail evaluating itself, either through an assessment of performance under another contract or an evaluation of proposals. Â§ FAR 9.505-3. In theses "impaired objectivity" cases, the concern is that the firm's ability to render impartial advice to the government could be or appear to be undermined.

Biased Ground Rules

Impaired Objectivity

3. All proposed subcontractor(s) must disclose to the prime contractor all contracts, both government (local, state and Federal) and non-government currently held as a prime and/or subcontractor, at the same level required under "a" through "h" stated above.

4. Examples of methods an offeror may use to mitigate conflicts of interest, including conflicts created as a result of the financial relationships of officers, directors and managers within the organization are provided below. The examples are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the possible methods to mitigate conflicts of interest. Further the Contacting Officer is not obligated to approve a mitigation method that uses one or more of these examples. An offeror's method of mitigating conflicts of interest, if required, will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis during the proposal evaluation process. Ë Ë Divestiture of the financial relationship the organization has in another organization; If the conflict exists because of the financial relationships of individuals within the organization, recusal of the individual from decisions related to the interest or divestiture of the relationships by the individual involved; and, If the conflict exists because of an individual's indirect interest, recusal of the individual from decision related to the interest, divestiture of the interest or removal of the individual from the work under the contract.

L.20 TREATMENT OF DATA IN PROPOSALS (FOIA)

The proposal(s) submitted in response to this request may contain data (trade secrets, business data, e.g., commercial information, financial information, and cost and pricing data; and technical data) which the offeror, including the prospective subcontractor(s), does not want used or disclosed for any purpose other than for evaluation of the proposal.

M.1 FAR 52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)

This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. The full text of a solicitation provision may be accessed electronically at this address: http://www.acquisition.gov NUMBER 52.217-5 M.2 TITLE EVALUATION OF OPTIONS DATE JUL 1990

GENERAL PROCEDURES

a. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal offers the best overall value to the Government. This will be determined by a trade-off technique that allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror in accordance with FAR 15.101-1. It permits tradeoffs among cost and non-cost evaluation factors. b. Offerors are advised that primary consideration will be given to the technical quality of the proposals in the evaluation process. In accordance with FAR 15.101-1(b)(2), all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, as the degree of technical equality (i.e., all factors other than cost) increases between proposals, cost may become the determining factor for award. Although cost is not controlling, cost reasonableness and realism will be considered. NOTE: The combined evaluated (most probable) costs for the base period and all option periods will be utilized in determining the best value. c. CMS will perform a cost analysis on the total estimated cost to determine if it is fair and reasonable. CMS will also perform a cost realism analysis in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(d).

114 | P a g e

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002
d. The evaluation will be performed in accordance with the methodology set forth in Sections M.2 and M.3 and in accordance with the criteria set forth in Sections M.4 and M.5 below. e. The business proposal will be analyzed and evaluated to determine the reasonableness and the realism of the proposed cost/price. (The business proposal and Organizational Conflict of Interest Certificate will not be scored but will be reviewed in accordance with M.6, M.7 and M.8 of this Section.) f. Selection will be made in accordance with the guidelines of FAR Subpart 15.6, Source Selection. g. Offerors are hereby advised that proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will first be screened to determine if they pass the pass/fail requirements. Proposals that do not pass this first level screening will not be further considered in the source selection process. h . The methodology to be followed in the evaluation of the written technical proposal by the TEP will be the application of the technical criteria set forth in Sections M.4 and M.5 below. The evaluation will produce ratings for each offeror based upon the information contained in the proposals. Therefore, the written technical proposal shall provide all information necessary to properly evaluate the proposal in accordance with the evaluation criteria. The Contracting Officer may request clarifying information from an offeror, if required to complete the evaluation of the written technical proposal. An offeror should not assume that the Contracting Officer will independently obtain information necessary to evaluate its proposal and should therefore supply all information required to evaluate its proposal. Failure to provide the information required to evaluate a proposal may result in rejection of the proposal as being technically unacceptable or in a finding that the proposal is excluded from the competitive range. Information from any oral presentation, if applicable, may be used to inform the evaluation of the technical proposal. i. Pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.306(c)(2) and FAR Clause 52.215-1(f)(4), the Government may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. In accordance with FAR 9.103, contracts shall be awarded to responsible prospective contractors only. Before awarding any contract, the Contracting Officer must make an affirmative determination of the prospective contractor's responsibility. FAR 9.104-1,

j.

115 | P a g e

General standards, lists the areas that shall be considered. A determination of nonresponsibility will preclude an offeror from receiving an award. k. CMS will not enter into a contract with an entity that it determines has, or has the potential for, an unresolved organizational conflict of interest unless the FAR waiver process is followed. l. Evaluation of the option periods will be conducted pursuant to FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options.

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002

m. CMS reserves the right to make a single award or multiple awards, but anticipates making one (1) award from this solicitation. In addition, the RFP may be amended or canceled as necessary to meet CMS requirements. M.3 EVALUATION PROCESS

The evaluation process for this acquisition will be accomplished as follows: a. All offerors' proposals will first be screened to determine if they pass the pass/fail requirements. Proposals that do not pass this first level screening will not be further considered in the source selection process. The evaluation factors to be used to determine if an offeror passes this initial screening process can be found in Section M.4 below. b. Once the pass/fail screening has been accomplished, the passing offerors' written technical proposals will then be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1 and the evaluation criteria contained in Sections M.4 and M.5 below. c. Once the pass/fail screening has been accomplished, a limited review of the passing offerors' business proposals will be conducted in accordance with Section M.8 below. A complete cost analysis and cost realism analysis will be accomplished prior to award if the Government awards a contract without discussions. If the Contracting Officer determines that discussions are necessary, a complete cost analysis and cost realism analysis will be accomplished after establishment of the competitive range. A passing offeror's proposal may be eliminated from the competition based upon the results of the evaluation of the written technical proposals and the limited review of the business proposals, prior to discussions or a full cost realism evaluation. d. If the Contracting Officer determines that discussions are necessary, the Contracting Officer will establish an initial competitive range comprised of all of the most highly rated proposals, unless the competitive range is further reduced for purposes of efficiency.

In accordance with FAR 15.306, if after discussions have begun, an offeror originally in the competitive range is no longer considered to be among the most highly rated offerors being considered for award, that offeror may be eliminated from the competitive range whether or not all material aspects of the proposal have been discussed, or whether or not the offeror has been afforded an opportunity to submit a proposal revision. f. If discussions are conducted, the Contracting Officer may request proposal revisions to clarify and document understandings reached during discussions. At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror still in the competitive range will be given an opportunity to submit a final proposal revision (FPR). g. If discussions are conducted, FPRs will be subject to: 1) final evaluation of price or cost and other salient factors; and, 2) an evaluation of technical factors as necessary. The technical evaluation panel may reevaluate offerors. h. After evaluation of the initial proposals or, if discussions are conducted, the FPRs, an apparent awardee will be selected for award. After selection of the successful proposal, the Contracting Officer may finalize details with the selected offeror, if necessary. This may involve, among other things, discussion of any outstanding organizational conflict of interest concerns. However, the Contracting Officer will not introduce any factor that could have an effect on the selection process after the common cutoff date for receipt of proposals, nor will the finalization process in any way prejudice the competitive interest or rights of the unsuccessful offerors. The Contracting Officer will restrict finalization of details with the selected offeror to definitizing the final agreement on terms and conditions, assuming none of these factors were involved in the selection process. M.4 TECHNICAL EVALUATION

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002

a. Initial Screen - Pass/Fail Offerors are hereby advised that proposals submitted in response to this solicitation will be screened to determine if they pass the pass/fail requirements. Proposals that do not pass this first level screening will not be further considered in the source selection process. The evaluation factors to be used to determine if an offeror passes this initial screening process are as follows: (All criteria must be met in order to be considered further and, if this narrative summary does not clearly explain how the offeror meets each pass/fail requirement, the Agency is under no obligation to seek information from sources outside the Proposal's pass/fail requirements section.)

117 | P a g e

1. The offeror must demonstrate that it has operated and managed at least one facility that support intake, triage, review, storage, and destruction of submitted documentation, as well as receipt and processing of correspondence, for at least one client for a period of at least 12 consecutive months. 2. The offeror must demonstrate experience processing any combination of at least 15 million paper and/or electronic submissions per year for one client. 3. At the time of proposal submission, the offeror must provide documented proof that its accounting system has been approved (audited by a Federal Government agency or audit function, i.e., DCAA or DCMA) and is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract. The approval of the accounting system must be within the last five years. IMPORTANT NOTES: These pass/fail requirements are based on the premise that to be successful in the performance of this contract, offerors must possess relevant capabilities which have been demonstrated through previous work experience that is verifiable by CMS. This experience must have occurred within the past three years and may be a combination of corporate experience from the offeror, or a single subcontractor that will perform major or critical aspects of the criteria and/or multiple legal entities that are owned under the offeror's single corporate umbrella. The offeror may be a newly-created subsidiary. A newly-created subsidiary may be able to meet these criteria using the experience of the offeror, a single subcontractor that will perform major or critical aspects of the criteria and/or multiple legal entities that are owned under the offeror's single corporate umbrella. "A single subcontractor that will perform major or critical aspects of the criteria" means a subcontractor proposed to perform a minimum of 25% of the labor hours. Subcontracting agreements and the establishment of new legal entities must be final and fully executed at the time of proposal submission. b. Evaluation Criteria For those proposals that pass the initial Pass/Fail screening, the evaluation criteria in Section M.5 below, with relative ratings (see rating definitions) assigned to each criterion as indicated, will be applied to the technical evaluation of each proposal. The technical evaluation criteria are listed below in descending order of importance. 1. 2. 3. 4. Eligibility Support Technical Capability Program Management Corporate Experience Past Performance

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002

3. Corporate Experience The offeror will be evaluated on relevant experiences within the past three (3) years as evidenced by the following: a. Experience successfully operating a document processing operation of similar size and scope to that which is described in the Statement of Work and this RFP. In evaluating this experience, CMS will consider the volume of the paper intake and electronic submissions, the variety and complexity of the submitted forms and documents, the handling of complex issues, and the successful use of information technology. b. Experience with communicating and coordinating simultaneously with at least two (2) entities (one of which must include a federal, state, or local entity) to accomplish program objectives on a nationwide scale. c. Experience adhering to security standards and Government records management procedures, and remediating security vulnerabilities. d. Experience with eligibility and enrollment policy and operations, including public benefit programs and private health insurance products, and/or activities that are similar from a subject matter or operational perspective. e.

Past Performance The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror's past performance within the last three (3) years in directly related work of similar scope and complexity of work described in the Statement of Work. If the Government determines that the work is irrelevant, the past performance will not be considered. This evaluation is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officer's responsibility determination. Past performance of significant and/or critical subcontractors will be considered to the extent warranted by the subcontractor's involvement in the proposed effort. The Government will consider the following areas of performance when evaluating the degree of performance risk:
123 | P a g e

a) Quality of Product or Service Â­ (e.g., compliance with contract requirements, accuracy of reports, technical excellence/appropriateness of personnel, performance against performance metrics) b) Timeliness of Performance Â­ (e.g., met interim milestones, reliable, responsive to technical direction, met all delivery schedules on time) c) Cost Control Â­ (e.g. within budget, current, accurate and complete billings, relationship of negotiated costs to actuals, cost efficiencies) d) Business Relations Â­ (e.g., prompt notification of problem, reasonable, cooperative, flexible, proactive, responsive to contract requirements, recommended solutions) e) Customer Satisfaction Â­ (e.g., interface with end user of product or service.) Offerors with no record of past performance will receive neither an unfavorable nor favorable rating. NOTE: While the offeror's lack of performance history would result in a neutral past performance rating, a neutral score could be considered less favorable than a favorable past performance rating. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. The Government may also consider, for example, award or incentive fee evaluations; information from the references listed in the proposal under past performance, pass/fail and corporate experience; other customers known to the Government; the federal government's Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS); and others who may have useful and relevant information. If no organizational past performance history exists, CMS will consider references for significant or critical subcontractors, key personnel, and, in the case of a joint venture, constituent companies. Past performance questionnaire references will be considered "adverse" if a rating of "0" or "1" is received and neutral if a rating of "2" is received. Material comments in the past performance questionnaire references may cause evaluators to deviate from these general principles.

EVALUATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAM

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002

1. Organizational Conflict Of Interest Failure to submit the required Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Certificate may result in the offeror being determined non-responsive to the solicitation requirements and therefore, ineligible for award. The OCI Certificates will be reviewed in accordance with contract Section H.10 and Section L.17 of this solicitation and FAR Part 9. Important: Offerors that meet the OCI exclusion listed in Section H.10.c.2.(e) and L.17.c. are ineligible for award under this request for proposal. 2. Evaluation of Attestations CMS may use Attestations to assist in determining whether the offeror is responsible under FAR 9.1. If an offeror does not submit its Compliance Program Attestation in accordance with the solicitation, the proposal may be deemed nonresponsive to the solicitation requirements and therefore, ineligible for award. If CMS discovers that an offeror has submitted false Attestations, the Contracting Officer will make a determination that the offeror has an unsatisfactory record of integrity and business ethics and the proposal will be removed from award consideration. M.7 SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS (SDB) PARTICIPATION

SDB participation will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall commitment and realism of the offeror's SDB Participation targets will be used in determining the relative merits of the offeror's proposal and in selecting the offeror whose proposal is considered to offer the best value to the Government. The extent of the offeror's Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Targets will be evaluated before determination of the competitive range if one is established. Evaluation of SDB participation will be assessed based on consideration of the information presented in the offeror's proposal. The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has demonstrated a commitment to use SDB concerns for the work that it intends to perform. The realism of the offers proposed targets will be evaluated based on the following factors: (a) Extent to which SDB concerns are specifically identified (Note: Small Disadvantaged Business Concern is defined at FAR 2.101)
125 | P a g e

(b) Extent of commitment to use SDB concerns (e.g. Are subcontract arrangements already in place, letters of commitment, teaming agreements, etc.) M.8 BUSINESS PROPOSAL EVALUATION

HHSM-500-2012-RFP-0002

A limited review of the business proposal will be conducted for all offerors who pass the initial Pass/Fail screening. The limited review of the business proposal will include the following at a minimum: Ë Ë Ë Ë Ë Whether proposals were submitted in accordance with the instructions provided in Section L. A check for mathematical accuracy; however, offerors bear the risk of any errors in their submitted materials. A review of proposed assumptions to assure consistency with solicitation assumptions. A review of proposed costs against the Government Cost Estimate. If anomalies are detected, a more in-depth analysis of assumptions and other areas of the business proposal will be conducted.

A complete cost analysis and cost realism analysis will be accomplished after establishment of the competitive range or prior to award if awarded without discussions. An offeror that passes the pass/fail evaluation may be eliminated from the competition based upon the results of the evaluation of the written technical proposals and the limited review of the business proposals, prior to discussions or a full cost realism evaluation. The business proposal evaluation will consist of a cost analysis utilizing cost or pricing data or information other than cost or pricing data to determine the reasonableness of the proposed costs. Independent of the cost analysis, a cost realism analysis will also be performed. This process will consist of review and evaluation of specific elements of each offeror`s proposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror`s technical proposal, and to determine the probable cost of the offeror's performance. The cost analysis and cost realism analysis will be used to determine that the offeror`s proposed costs are fair, reasonable, and realistic for the work to be performed.
