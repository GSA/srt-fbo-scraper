The proposed CR will be Mr. Gregory Raney from NASIC. E.1.2 The Government may conduct formal quality audits, on either a scheduled or an unscheduled basis, to verify contractor performance, as well as adherence to, and the continued viability of, the contractor's quality control measures. Representatives of the using activity will perform these audits. Audits may consist of a total review of the contractor's overall operation, or merely a review of one separate function or service delivered to an end-user. E.1.3 Although this task will not be performance based, the Government requires that the contractor develop a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) and Performance Matrix(PM). This is a requirement of the customer because of the level of security and sensitivity of the intelligence work involved. The QASP and performance metrics shall include a surveillance schedule and clearly state the surveillance method(s) to be used. The QASP and performance matrix should focus on the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the performance outputs to be delivered by the contractor and not on the steps required or procedures used to provide the product or service. The QASP and performance matrix shall be developed to fairly evaluate the contractor's performance throughout the performance period and measure results of only the most critical and essential elements in the stated objectives of the acquisition.

Clauses Subcontracting under this task is both feasible and desirable and will be sought, promoted, and sustained throughout the course of the acquisition in accordance with FAR 19.7 ­ The Small Business Subcontracting Program. The following clauses are incorporated into the solicitation and any resultant contract. 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration. CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (AUG 2012) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. "Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. "Registered in the CCR database" means that-- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14) into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--

The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.

Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent.

(1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract. (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. (1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert "None" if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert `None'."] (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a prorata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert "$0" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert `None')."] (2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated

ID05120091 PART I - THE SCHEDULE SECTION I ­ Contract Clauses

ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. (4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment-- (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); (B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures; (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost-- (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within

(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. (6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions.

(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.

(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.

(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.

In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. 52.212-5 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT STATUTES OR EXECUTIVE ORDERS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (AUG 2012) (a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). _x_Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

(k) The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith with-- (1) The clause of this contract entitled "Utilization Of Small Business Concerns;" or (2) An approved plan required by this clause, shall be a material breach of the contract.

(iii) The authority to acknowledge receipt or reject the ISR resides-- (A) In the case of the prime Contractor, with the Contracting Officer; and (B) In the case of a subcontract with a subcontracting plan, with the entity that awarded the subcontract. (2) SSR. (i) Reports submitted under individual contract plans-- (A) This report encompasses all subcontracting under prime contracts and subcontracts with the awarding agency, regardless of the dollar value of the subcontracts. (B) The report may be submitted on a corporate, company or subdivision (e.g. plant or division operating as a separate profit center) basis, unless otherwise directed by the agency. (C) If a prime Contractor and/or subcontractor is performing work for more than one executive agency, a separate report shall be submitted to each executive agency covering only that agency's contracts, provided at least one of that agency's contracts is over $650,000 (over $1.5 million for construction of a public facility) and contains a subcontracting plan. For DoD, a consolidated report shall be submitted for all contracts awarded by military departments/agencies and/or subcontracts awarded by DoD prime Contractors. However, for construction and related maintenance and repair, a separate report shall be submitted for each DoD component. (D) For DoD and NASA, the report shall be submitted semi-annually for the six months ending March 31 and the twelve months ending September 30. For civilian agencies, except NASA, it shall be submitted annually for the twelve month period ending September 30. Reports are due 30 days after the close of each reporting period. (E) Subcontract awards that are related to work for more than one executive agency shall be appropriately allocated.

(D) The authority to acknowledge or reject SSRs for commercial plans resides with the Contracting Officer who approved the commercial plan. (iii) All reports submitted at the close of each fiscal year (both individual and commercial plans) shall include a Year-End Supplementary Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses. The report shall include subcontract awards, in whole dollars, to small disadvantaged business concerns by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Industry Subsector. If the data are not available when the year-end SSR is submitted, the prime Contractor and/or subcontractor shall submit the Year-End Supplementary Report for Small Disadvantaged Businesses within 90 days of submitting the year-end SSR. For a commercial plan, the Contractor may obtain from each of its subcontractors a predominant NAICS Industry Subsector and report all awards to that subcontractor under its predominant NAICS Industry Subsector.

If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.
I-45

ID05120091 PART I - THE SCHEDULE SECTION I ­ Contract Clauses

QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN (QASP)

1.0

INTRODUCTION

This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is pursuant to the requirements listed in the performance-based Performance Work Statement (PWS) entitled "Foreign Materiel Exploitation Engineering and Maintenance Support Services" for the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, Foreign Materiel Exploitation Squadron, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. This performance-based plan sets forth the procedures and guidelines the NASIC will use in evaluating the technical performance of the operations and maintenance (O&M) and the Research and Development (R&D) service contractor. 1.1 PURPOSE

1.1.1 The QASP provides a means for evaluating whether the contractor is meeting the performance standards. This QASP is designed to define roles and responsibilities, identify the performance objectives, define the methodologies used to monitor and evaluate the contractor's performance, describe quality assurance reporting, and describe the analysis of quality assurance monitoring results. 1.2 AUTHORITY

1.2.1 Authority for issuance of this QASP is provided under Contract Section E ­ Inspection and Acceptance, which provides for inspections and acceptance of the services and documentation called for in task orders, to be executed by the Contracting Officer or a duly authorized representative. 1.3 SCOPE

1.3.1 The Contractor develops and submits a Quality Control Plan (QCP) for Government approval in compliance with the contract. Once accepted, the Contractor then uses the QCP to guide and to rigorously document the implementation of the required management and quality control actions to achieve the specified results. The QASP on the other hand, is put in place to provide Government surveillance oversight of the Contractor's quality control efforts to assure that they are timely, effective and are delivering the results specified in the contract or task order. 1.4 PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT APPROACH

1

ID05120091 PART I - THE SCHEDULE SECTION J ­ List of Attachments Attachment #3 - QASP

1.4.1 This QASP will define the performance management approach taken by the NASIC to monitor, manage, and take appropriate action on the contractor's performance against expected outcomes or performance objectives communicated in the PWS. Because this is largely a Time and Material contract, coordination between the Client Representative (CR), Technical Monitor and the contractor will ensure mutual understanding of requirements. There will be no regularly schedule interval for inspection. The contractors' performance will be reviewed and evaluated by the Government on a performance basis either by task, project, or deliverable as coordinated with the Government.

2.0

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. The Contracting Officer (CO) is responsible for monitoring contract compliance, contract administration and cost control; and resolving any differences between the observations documented by the Client Representative(s) and the contractor's performance. 2.2 The CO will designate CR(s) as the Government authority for performance management. The number of additional representatives depends on the Government's need. The Government will also designate Technical Monitor(s) who will be responsible for monitoring, assessing, and communicating the contractor's technical performance. The CR(s) will have the responsibility for QA monitoring and documentation. Any issues or concerns that cannot be resolved at the working level or which impact on contractual requirements shall be reported to the CO and/or the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for resolution and contractual action.

3.0

METHODOLOGIES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE

3.1 As this is a majority Time and Material effort, the contractor's performance is reviewed and evaluated by the Government on a performance basis in accordance with the work statement. There will be no regularly scheduled interval for inspection. The Government will use the Technical Monitor(s), CR(s), as well as reports and input from NASIC and government/nongovernment agencies/employees as sources of comments on the contractor's performance. 3.2 Technical: Technical performance at site will be evaluated on a real time basis. Depending on duration, performance may be reviewed monthly (or more often as necessary) through meetings between the Technical Monitor(s) and the contractor. The technical elements monitored under this contract vary with each tasks being performed. Factors that may be evaluated and monitored: - Anticipation of technical challenges and issues to ensure accomplishment of tasks - Adaptability to change - Response time - Technical accuracy and clarity of response - Support and product quality 3.3 Management: Coordination between the Technical Monitor(s), CR(s), and the contractor will ensure mutual understanding of requirements. Upon request from the CR, the Technical
2

ID05120091 PART I - THE SCHEDULE SECTION J ­ List of Attachments Attachment #3 - QASP

Monitor(s) will provide with assessments of the contractors' progress, quality of work performed, schedule status, and any risk associated with on-time and quality completion of work. 3.4 Schedule: Successful completion of tasks within specified cost ceilings is a result of the comprehensive working relationship established between the Government and the contractor. Providing the best value support to each task is the goal of this relationship. . 3.6 The acceptable quality levels (AQL) are located in Attachment 1. For certain critical activities such as those involving security, and safety, the desired performance level is established at one hundred percent (100%). Other levels of performance are keyed to the relative importance of the task to the overall FME mission performance at NASIC.

4.0

QUALITY ASSURANCE REPORTING

4.1 The Technical Monitor(s) through the CR(s) will provide a monthly overall evaluation of the contractor's performance to the COR. The evaluation criteria are listed in Attachment III. In case of a "Dissatisfied" or a "Very Dissatisfied" rating, QA monitoring will be documented by the CR(s) with Technical Monitor(s) inputs using the form in Attachment 2. The CR(s) will retain a copy of all completed QA monitoring forms and forward a completed form to the CO/COR.

5.0

ANALYSIS OF QUALITY ASSURANCE MONITORING RESULTS

5.1 The CR(s) may require the contractor to meet with the CO and/or CO and other Government personnel as deemed necessary to discuss performance evaluation. The CR(s) and Technical Monitor(s) will define a frequency of any reviews with the contractor. The review may discuss (but not limited to): - Monthly performance measured by the metrics and trends - Issues and concerns of both parties - Projected outlook for upcoming months and progress against expected trends - Recommendations made by the Technical Monitor(s) through the CR(s) based on contractor information - Issues arising from independent reviews and inspections 5.2 The Technical Monitor(s) must coordinate and communicate with the contractor and the CR(s) to resolve issues and concerns of marginal or unacceptable performance. During such communication, the contractor should present plans to adjust service levels accordingly to bring the satisfaction rating up to an acceptable level. 5.3 The CR (s), Technical Monitor(s), and contractor should jointly formulate tactical and long term courses of action. Major changes to services will be incorporated as a contract modification facilitated by the CR(s).

tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

ID05120091 PART I - THE SCHEDULE SECTION L ­ Contract Clauses

women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.

An offeror submitting a commercial plan can reflect this commitment through subcontracting opportunities it provides that relate to the offeror's production generally; i.e., for both its commercial and Government business. (c) GSA believes that this potential contract provides significant opportunities for the use of small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Consequently, in addressing the eleven elements described at FAR 52.219-9(d) of the clause in this contract entitled Small Business Subcontracting Plan, the offeror shall: Demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteranowned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns in performing the contract. (1) Include a description of the offeror's subcontracting strategies used in any previous contracts, significant achievements, and how this plan will build upon those earlier achievements. (2) Demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small business subcontracting program's objectives and GSA's expectations, and it is committed to taking those actions necessary to meet these goals or objectives. (d) In determining the acceptability of any subcontracting plan, the Contracting Officer will take each of the following actions: (1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror demonstrates an understanding of the small business subcontracting program's objectives and GSA's expectations with respect to the program and has included all the information, goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219-9. (2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the same industry. (3) Consider information and potential sources obtained from agencies administering national and local preference programs and other advocacy groups in evaluating whether the goals stated in the plan adequately reflect the anticipated potential for subcontracting to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteranowned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns. (4) Review the offeror's description of its strategies, historical performance and significant achievements in placing subcontracts for the same or similar products or services with small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteranowned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns. The offeror's description can apply to commercial as well as previous Government contracts. (e) Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan and/or correct deficiencies in a plan within the time specified by the Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award.

M.1 Evaluation (a) The Government intends to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation requirements (including all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by the solicitation) will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other non-price factors considered. This is a best-value source selection in accordance with FAR 15.3, where an award may be made to other than the low-price offeror as long as the decision is consistent with the source selection criteria described herein and the tradeoffs are determined by the Source Selection Authority (SSA) to be advantageous to the Government. The source selection decision shall be based on a comparative assessment of proposals against all source selection criteria in this solicitation. The following significant evaluation factors shall be used to evaluate offers:     Factor 1 ­ Management & Staffing Plan Factor 2 ­ Technical Merit Factor 3 ­ Past Performance Factor 4 - Price

(b) Contractor MUST have Security Level Clearances to be considered for this procurement as outlined in Section L.1.2 SECURITY LEVEL.

options at the time of award of the base quantities. (e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. M.1.1 Eligibility for Award Proposals shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions set out in Section L. For an offer to be eligible for award, the offeror must agree to all terms and conditions of the solicitation, must be determined responsible, and must not receive a rating of Not Acceptable for any evaluation factor. The determination of offeror responsibility will be made by the Contracting Officer and will be assessed on a pass/fail basis. The Government will make determinations of responsibility in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.1, Responsible Prospective Contractors, using information provided in the proposal and information available from other sources. The Government also reserves the right to determine the responsibility of prospective major subcontractors. M.1.2 Source Selection Process The source selection will proceed in two sequential phases: Initial Proposal Evaluation Final Revised Proposal Evaluation (if needed) Offerors are advised that the Government intends to award a contract without discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions. The Government also reserves the right to make more than one competitive range determination and to conduct more than one round of discussions/negotiations during either the Initial or Final Proposal Evaluation phases. M.1.3 Initial Proposal Evaluation Initial proposal evaluation will proceed as follows: Initial Evaluation. Technical and Price proposals will be reviewed and evaluated. Offerors may be given the opportunity to remedy irregularities or apparent mistakes in their proposals. Technical and Price proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the factors and criteria set out in Section M. Deficiencies will be identified, areas lacking sufficient detail or found to be ambiguous and needing clarification will be noted, and preliminary strengths and weaknesses will be identified. Competitive Range Determination. Based on the ratings of each proposal against all evaluation criteria, the contracting officer will establish a competitive range
3

ID05120091 PART I - THE SCHEDULE SECTION M ­ Evaluation Factors to Award

comprised of the most highly rated proposals. Less competitive offerors will be eliminated from further consideration. In the event only one offeror is in the competitive range, the Government reserves the right to award to that offeror without further discussions. Discussions. In the event discussions are necessary, the Contracting Officer will conduct written and/or oral discussions with each offeror within the competitive range. The primary objective of these discussions is to maximize the Government's ability to obtain best value based on the requirements and the evaluation factors set forth in this solicitation. As part of discussions, deficiencies will be identified and communicated to the offeror, areas lacking sufficient detail or found to be ambiguous will be clarified, and preliminary strengths and weaknesses will be identified. Call for Proposal Revisions. Following discussions (if they are held), offerors may be given the opportunity to submit proposal revisions (change pages). If the Contracting Officer calls for Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs), all offerors in the competitive range will be given the opportunity to submit FPRs. The revisions will be evaluated in accordance with Section M. M.1.4 Solicitation Amendments The Government reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions of the RFP at any time prior to the conclusion of discussions and/or award of the contract (in the event discussions are not held). If the Government does amend the RFP, the Government will so advise all offerors, and will notify interested parties in accordance with statute and regulation. M.1. 5 Unrealistic Proposals Offerors are placed on notice that proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical and management commitment or unrealistically low in price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of management and technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements. This may be grounds for rejection of the proposal. M.1.6 The offeror shall indicated in their proposal if they have a Government Approved Purchasing System. Having a Government Approved Purchasing System shall be viewed favorably.
