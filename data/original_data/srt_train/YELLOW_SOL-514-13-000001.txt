In addition, all employees could opt to switch coverage from Civil Service  Retirement to the Colombian Social Security System.    The object of the Integral Social Security System is to guarantee the irrevocable rights of each  person and the community to have a quality of life in accordance with human dignity, by means of  protection against contingencies which might affect them.    The system includes the obligations of the state and society, institutions and resources destined to  guaranteeing coverage of benefits of an economic, health and complementary services nature,  subject of Law 100, or others which may be incorporated in the future.

  5.   Annual Leave    A.  Accrual of Annual Leave:      1)  Employees will accrue 16 work days of annual leave per year.      2)  The leave year will begin on the first day of pay period 1 and end on the last day of pay  period 26.    B.  Crediting of Annual Leave:    Annual leave will be credited on a payperiod basis as follows:      Pay Periods  Hours to be Credited 125  5  26  3                                                                                                           During the first six months of service, employees normally will not be authorized annual leave.   However, in the event of special or emergency circumstances, annual leave may be authorized  individually upon the request by the supervisor and with the final approval of the administrative  officer or his designee.    C.  Charges to Annual Leave:      1)  Minimum charge for annual leave is one hour.    2)  Annual leave may be taken in units of hours, days or weeks.    D.

E.  Restoration of Annual Leave:    Previously approved and scheduled annual leave which is canceled by the employee's supervisor  due to work requirements at post, and which otherwise is subject to forfeiture, may be restored   to the employee's account at the beginning of the next leave year for use during that leave year.   Restored annual leave must be used within one year and may not be carried over from year to  year.   Restoration of canceled annual leave must be approved in writing by the employee's  supervisor and by the American Administrative or Personnel Officer, and reported to the  timekeeper and B&F.

Annual Leave accrued under system patterned after U.S. Annual and Sick Leave Act:    Annual leave balances accrued under the leave system patterned after the U.S. Annual and Sick  Leave Act will remain to the employee's credit after the date of enrollment in the local leave  system.  This annual leave can be used by the employee to supplement annual leave accrued  under the local leave plan.  At the time of separation from employment the outstanding balance  of this annual leave will be converted to a lump sum payment, subject to the limitations in Section  5.G., below.    G.  Lump Sum Payment for Unused Annual Leave:    Upon separation, an employee will receive a lumpsum payment for unused annual leave,  computed on the basis of the employee's pay at the time of separation.  Payment will be for a  total of:  (A) the number of unused annual leave hours accrued under the USG system leave plan  which may not exceed 240 hours, plus (B) the number of unused annual leave hours earned during  the current leave year, plus (C) any unused carryover which had accrued to the employee's leave  account.  However, payment for the combined total of these three categories of unused annual  leave will be subject to a maximum limit of the employee's annual leave accrual as set forth in 5.A.  above, plus the allowable carryover.  For example, the employee earns 128 hours (16 days) of  annual leave per year.  The maximum limit of lump sum payment for unused leave would be 336  hours (128 hours current year's earnings plus 208 hours carryover).    H.  Advance of Annual Leave:    After completion of one year of service, annual leave may be advanced within the limits of the  amount the employee would earn during the remainder of the leave year.  Indebtedness for  annual leave at the time of separation will be deducted from the employee's final salary and/or  severance pay.

Otherwise, the sick leave is forfeited.    8.  Maternity Leave:    Female employees will be entitled to maternity leave with full pay for a period of eighty four  (84) days after delivery. Husbands or male permanent companions are entitled to a paid  paternity leave of four working days when the father is the only one affiliated with the Social  Security Health System. When both parents are affiliated with the Social Security Health  System, the husband or male permanent companion is entitled to eight working days of paid  rest as paternity leave.    Husbands or male permanent companions are entitled to a paid paternity leave of tour to eight  working  days,  provided  that:  a)  they  submit  to  the  relevant  health  entity  (EPS)  the  birth  certificate  of  the  newborn  within  30  days  following  the  birthday;  and  b)  husbands  or  male  permanent companions have effectively paid social security contributions to the health system,  for at least 100 weeks prior to the birthday of the child.    The  male  permanent  companion  is  entitled  to  this  benefit,  if  and  only  if,  he  has  cohabited  with  the mother of the newborn child for at least two years prior to the child's birth date.    Female  employees  should  be  excused  from  work  for  a  maximum  of  one  hour  per  day  for  the  purpose of nursing their children until the child reaches six months of age.    9.  Leave Without Pay (LWOP)    LWOP may not be used as a punitive measure, or in cases of Post closing for downsizing.  LWOP is  granted at the employee's request, and like other leave categories, must be approved or  disapproved by Post Management.  LWOP may be granted by Post Management for 30 days or  less and under certain circumstances up to a maximum of 90 days.  Approval from the employee's  agency headquarters must be obtained for periods of LWOP in excess of 90 days.    Post must prepare a SF50 or JF62 for FSN/PSC/PSA employees on LWOP for more than one pay  period and submit it to the payroll branch with an info copy to the employee's agency  headquarters.    For LWOP that totals more than one pay period within the calendar year, the health, life,  retirement, social security, death/funeral plans premium payments must be fully funded by the  employee.  These payments may be made in advance, per PP, or upon return to duty.  When these  premium costs are jointly shared by the employee and the USG or are wholly paid by the USG, the  employee on LWOP beyond one cumulative pay period must sign a written agreement to pay the  full cost (USG's and employee's).  If the employee elects not to pay the full cost, the USG and  employee contributions will stop and coverage under the insurance and social security plans will

Post management will need to determine if Postpaid life  insurance payment should continue during longer periods of LWOP.  Other benefits, allowances,  or payments will not be made during nonpay status unless a specific exception is requested and  approved by PER/OE.    The Within Grade Increase (WGI) will be affected if an employee is on LWOP for an accumulative  period equaling a full pay period; the waiting period is extended by two workweeks for each full  pay period that an employee is on LWOP (3 FAM 7576.3).    Local or US holidays which occur within a period of LWOP will be charged as LWOP.  However, if  the employee is in the pay status on the workday preceding the holiday or the work day following  the holiday, the holiday will not be charged to LWOP.    When an employee's absence on LWOP within a year totals the equivalent of the hours in one pay  period, no proportionate amount of annual leave will be earned for that period.    10.  Holidays    If a US or local holiday(s) falls within a period of approved vacation leave, the employee will not be  charged leave for those days.    11.  Responsibility for Leave Records    A.   Timekeepers are responsible for the proper reporting of leave and making any required  reports to the Budget & Fiscal Office (B&F).  The timekeeper will maintain a copy of the T&A leave  report.    B.   The B&F Office will maintain leave records by individual employee.  This record will be  considered as the official leave file.  As necessary, the B&F will provide instructions and forms to  the timekeepers.

U.S. MISSION COLOMBIA: LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN SECTION 8:  LEAVE BENEFITS AND POLICIES  D. RESTORATION OF ANNUAL LEAVE POLICY (FROM 03 STATE 121436)      1.  This guidance applies to all Locally Employed (LE) Staff covered under the US style leave plan  and to all LE Staff covered under a post's Local Leave Plan (LLP) if the LLP provides for  restoration of annual leave.    2.  Restoration of annual leave is a privilege and not an entitlement.    3. Both management and employees are responsible for planning and scheduling annual leave  throughout the leave year to avoid forfeiture. Employees have an obligation to request annual  leave in a timely manner and to take into account any other types of leave provided under the  Local Leave Plan which the employee expects to request during the leave year. The supervisor  has the obligation to consider both the needs of the office and the employee's right to schedule  and take annual leave before approving requested leave. Scheduled leave is always subject to  cancellation, whether for the exigency of the public business or because of normal workload,  vacancies, poor leave scheduling, or other nonexigent circumstances. An employee's failure to   schedule annual leave, or to reschedule previously denied or cancelled leave, in order to avoid  forfeiture does not relieve management of its responsibility to ensure that an employee's leave  is in fact scheduled for use. An employee who refuses to schedule leave for use during the leave  year, or to take previously scheduled leave, is not entitled to restoration of forfeited annual  leave.    4. In order to qualify for restoration, the employee must have requested to use the annual  leave in writing, and the supervisor must have approved the employee's request in writing,  prior to the end of pay period 23. If post's Local Leave Plan does not have a pay period 1  through pay period 26 leave year, then for employees covered by the Local Leave Plan it must  have been approved a minimum of 3 full pay periods prior to the end of the leave year. If the  initial request for annual leave is not approved, the employee and supervisor must make every  effort to reschedule the annual leave.    5.  Scheduled annual leave that would otherwise be forfeited at the end of the leave year  because of denial or cancellation may qualify for restoration under one of the following  circumstances:    a.  an exigency of the public business b.  absence on approved leave due to the employee's  illness or injury or due to a family event c. administrative error     6. A request for restoration of forfeited annual leave must include the following  documentation:    The SF71 showing approval of scheduled leave a minimum of 3 full pay periods prior to the  end of the leave year.

U.S. MISSION COLOMBIA: LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN SECTION 8:  LEAVE BENEFITS AND POLICIES  D. RESTORATION OF ANNUAL LEAVE POLICY (FROM 03 STATE 121436) ­ CONTINUED.      A written statement prepared by the official who either denies or cancels an employee's  scheduled annual leave, dated and signed, and prepared at the time of denial or cancellation.  The statement should indicate why the official denied or cancelled the leave, and describe the  specific operational demand, with its inclusive dates, which caused the denial or cancellation.    In the case of a request on the basis of the exigency of public business, the statement above  must include a description of the specific exigency of public business that necessitated the  denial or cancellation. Normal workload, staffing turnover, and poor leave scheduling are not  qualifying exigent reasons.    In the case of a request on the basis of absence on approved leave, the statement must  include a description of the leave taken (sick leave, maternity leave, child care leave, etc.) and  the dates when it was taken. Note: this administrative policy does not override any provision in   a Local Leave Plan which requires employees to forfeit annual leave and/or to not accrue  annual leave during the period when the employee is on approved maternity leave, child care  leave, etc. End Note.    In the case of a request on the basis of Administrative Error, a description of the  Administrative Error.     In all cases, the reasons for not rescheduling the denied or cancelled annual leave must be  documented in the same manner and detail as required for initially canceling scheduled annual  leave.    7.  Requests for leave restoration must be submitted with the required documentation through  the employee's supervisor to the Embassy's Management Officer who has the authority to  approve the restoration of annual leave for Locally Employed Staff.   If the required  documentation is not submitted, there is no basis for approving the restoration of annual leave.  Leave restoration requests should be submitted to the Management Officer within 90 calendar  days after the completion of the leave year. The Management Officer may consider exceptions  to the 90 day policy on a casebycase basis. Requests for exceptions require full  documentation specifying the reasons for the delay.    8. A copy of the approved request for leave restoration, together with supporting  documentation, must be sent to the appropriate FSC Payroll Office.

S. Government (USG) agencies following the Mission's joint local  compensation plan subject to the following rules:    1) Applicability:    This plan is applicable to employees who are (a) working on a fulltime or parttime basis under  nontemporary direct hire appointments or under personal services agreements/contracts  and (b) paid under the terms of the Local Compensation Plan.    Excluded from coverage are employees working on intermittent or When Actually Employed  (WAE) schedules; nonpersonal services contract personnel and their employees, supplied by  an independent contractor licensed to do business in Colombia who provides services to other  local organizations as well as to the U.S. Mission; employees of USAID institutional contractors;  Peace Corps personal services contractors as indicated in MS 743; and Official Residence Expense  (ORE) employees.

U.S. MISSION COLOMBIA: LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN SECTION 11:  SEVERANCE PAY PLAN continued.    2)    Amount of Payment:    Law 50 of 1990 modified substantially the severance pay system which all employees of the  private sector are entitled to.  According to this new legal disposition, there are three different  systems of calculation of severance pay.  Although Law 50 of 1990 established this system for     labor contracts that were entered into on or after January 1, 1991; Post was authorized to  implement the system as follows:    a.    Traditional System    For labor contracts that were entered into prior to January 1, 1995:  The severance pay is  equivalent to one month's salary for each year of service, and proportionally for all  fractions of a year (less any partial payment of severance pay that may have occurred during the  course of employment) payable upon termination.  Under this severance pay system,  the employer effects payment of the severance pay directly to the employee.    b.    Annual Calculation System (ACS)    For labor contracts that were entered into prior to January 1, 1995, employees can opt to be  enrolled in the ACS.  For labor contracts entered into on or after January 1, 1995, enrollment in  the ACS is mandatory.  Such benefit is payable as follows:    As of December 31 of each year the employer must calculate the severance pay accrued for the  employee during the corresponding calendar year, on the basis of one month's salary if the  employee worked the full calendar year and proportionally for fractions of a year.  The severance  pay must be deposited by the employer no later than February 15 of each subsequent year, into a  severance pay fund designated by the employee.    This deposit constitutes final payment of the severance pay through December 31 of each year,  and thus, the calculation of the deposit that must be effected for each year should take into  account only the time worked by the employee during the corresponding calendar year and only  the salary for that year.  An employer who deposits the severance pay after February 15 must pay  the equivalent of a day's salary for each day of delay.    c. Integral Salary System    At this time, this does not affect post.          LCP effective 01/28/2010      Page 71 of 113         Colombia 

U.S. MISSION COLOMBIA: LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN SECTION 11:  SEVERANCE PAY PLAN continued.    3)  Computation of Severance Payment    a. Eligible employees are entitled to severance equal to one month's salary as defined below for  each creditable year of service and proportionally for any fraction of a year.    b. The salary basis for the calculation of the severance pay is the last monthly salary of the  employee or the average salary if the salary has been modified during the last three months of  employment.  The following formula should be used for both the Traditional and Annual  Calculation Systems: Base monthly salary X number of days worked / 360.  Additional examples  may be found in an attachment to the LCP.    c.  Severance pay will be computed on the basis of the employee's salary as defined in local law:  basic salary plus the Christmas bonus, vacation bonus, meal allowance, transportation allowance  (if applicable), miscellaneous benefit allowance (MBA), overtime and differentials.    4)    Eligibility Requirements    All employees paid under the terms of the Joint Local Compensation Plan and whose employment  with the USG is terminated is eligible for severance pay, except:    a.    Any criminal act committed against the employer, his/her family members or relatives, or  against the employing agency;    b.    Any grave damage willfully caused to the buildings, equipment, raw materials, instruments or  other objects connected with the workplace;    c.    The divulging of technical or commercial secrets or matters of a private nature to the serious  prejudice of the security of the employing agency and to the national security of the United States.    5)    Creditable Service    The following criteria govern the determination of creditable U.S. Government service:    a.  Creditable service is documented continuous service with the U.S. Government (USG) agencies  under directhire appointments, personal services agreements, and personal services contracts for  which severance     e pay has not been received.  Continuous service is service without a break of  more than three calendar days.    b   Creditable service does not include any personal services contract time with Peace Corps as  indicated in MS 743.

U.S. MISSION COLOMBIA: LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN SECTION 11:  SEVERANCE PAY PLAN continued.    c.    Creditable service may include indirect employment of socalled nonpersonal services with an  inhouse entity providing services exclusively to the Mission and considered by the Government of  Colombia to be an integral part of the Mission, when 1) severance pay has not previously been  received by this service, 2) such service immediately precedes personal services contract or direct hire employment without a break in service of more than three calendar days, and 3) such service  is recognized by Colombian law to be continuous service with the U.S. Government.    d.    Credible service does not include any period of employment under a Foreign Agricultural  Service personal services contract, by authority of PL 100202, 12/22/87, Title IV International  Programs, Foreign Agricultural Service, and 6 FAS/FAM 211.5. PSC time with FAS constitutes a  break in continuous service.    e.   Creditable service does not include any period during which an individual provided services to  the U.S. Mission under a purchase order, grant, cooperative agreement, institutional contract,  recreation or commissary association (unless paragraph d above applies), Fulbright commission  and similar arrangements.    f. All periods of leave without pay and other nonpay status which accumulate to more than two  weeks are deducted from creditable service.    g. Parttime service is prorated (reduced) according to the number of regularly scheduled hours in  the employee's workweek.  For purposes of prorating, 40 hours is a fulltime workweek.    6)    Refund of Payment    Persons who have received severance pay from the USG and are reemployed by the USG shall not  be permitted to refund any portion of the payment.  Eligibility towards new severance pay  entitlement shall begin as of the date of reemployment.    7)    Transfer    A.  Between USG Agencies Within a Country Severance payments are not authorized to employees  who are transferred between civilian USG agencies within a country.  Transfers are considered a  change in employment from one USG agency to another without a break in service of 3 calendar  days or more.  Service credit towards severance pay, which has been earned through employment  with the losing agency, is transferred to the gaining agency.  The gaining agency will assume all  obligations for the payment of severance pay for prior creditable periods of service with any USG  agency, if the employee is entitled to severance pay on final separation.  For transfers involving  military service components, interagency funding is to be resolved on a casebycase basis.    B.  Between or within USG agencies in different countries the rules in paragraph 7a apply.  Under  these circumstances, service credit toward severance pay earned under the terms of the losing   LCP effective 01/28/2010      Page 73 of 113         Colombia

Any severance payments to such employees  are made on the terms of the severance pay plan in effect at the gaining post.    8)    Appeals    If disputes arise involving severance settlements, the employee has the right of appeal to the  Principal Officer or designee.  The decision of the Principal Officer or designee shall be final.  Rules  governing grievance appeals are on file at the Mission's Management Office.  Rules may not be  WAIVED OR REVISED WITHOUT HR/OE/CM AUTHORIZATION.

COMPENSATORY TIME FOR TRAVEL    NUMBER/DATE OF THE STATE AUTHORIZATION TELEGRAM:  06 STATE 075136 (DATED MAY 10,  2006).    SUBJECT:  LE STAFF:  COMPENSATORY TIME FOR OFFICIAL TRAVEL.      Compensatory Time for Official Travel (Effective 10/01/08)  EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2008, EMPLOYEES ARE ELIGIBLE TO EARN COMPENSATORY TIME FOR  OFFICIAL TRAVEL THAT OCCURS ON OR AFTER OCTOBER 1, 2008 THAT IS NOT OTHERWISE  COMPENSABLE HOURS OF DUTY.  THIS BENEFIT IS PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN  IN 06 STATE 075136.     1.  Description    Compensatory  time  off  for  official  travel  is  earned  by  an  employee  for  time  spent  in  a  travel  status  away  from  the  employee's  official  duty  station  when  such  time  is  not  otherwise  compensable hours of duty.    Employees  are  encouraged  to  perform  official  travel  during  regular  duty  hours,  whenever  practical.    An  employee  who  intends  to  submit  a  claim  for  earned  compensatory  time  for  official  travel  performed  outside  regular  duty  hours  will  not  be  authorized  business  class  travel  for  flights  over 14 hours.    2.  Creditable Travel    To  be  creditable  under  this  plan,  travel  must  be  officially  authorized.  In  other  words,  travel  must be for work purposes and must be approved by an authorized agency official or otherwise  authorized under established agency policies.    For the purpose of compensatory time off for travel, time in a travel status includes    Time spent traveling between the official duty station and a temporary duty station (e.g., FSI);    Time spent traveling between two temporary duty stations; and    The  usual  waiting  time  that  precedes  or  interrupts  such  travel  (e.g.,  waiting  at  an  airport  or  train  station  prior  to  departure).   An  employee  may  claim  no  more  than  2  hours  prior  to  flight  time for domestic travel and no more than 3 hours for overseas travel.  An extended waiting

U.S. MISSION COLOMBIA: LOCAL COMPENSATION PLAN SECTION 17:  TRAVEL AND TDY BENEFITS  A. COMPENSATORY TIME FOR TRAVEL CONTINUED.    period,  i.e.,  an  unusually  long  wait  during  which  the  employee  is  free  to  rest,  sleep,  or   otherwise use the time for his or her own purposes, is not considered time in a travel status.          3.  Commuting Time    Travel  outside  of  regular  working  hours  between  an  employee's  home  and  a  temporary  duty  station  or  transportation  terminal  outside  the  limits  of  his  or  her  official  duty  station  is  considered  creditable  travel  time.  However,  the  employee's  normal  hometowork/workto home commuting time will be deducted from the creditable travel time.    Travel  outside  of  regular  working  hours  between  a  worksite  and  a  transportation  terminal  is  creditable travel time, and no commuting time offset applies.    Travel outside of regular working hours to or from a transportation terminal within the limits of  the  employee's  official  duty  station  is  considered  equivalent  to  commuting  time  and  is  not  creditable travel time.    4.  Crediting and Usage    Compensatory time for travel is credited and used in minimum increments of onequarter of an  hour  (15  minutes).   This  category  of  compensatory  time  earned  will  be  maintained  separately  from compensatory time earned for compensable hours of duty in lieu of overtime pay.    Employees  must  request  credit  for  earned  compensatory  time  for  official  travel  in  writing  to  their supervisor no later than 30 calendar days after the completion of the official travel.    If  earned  compensatory  time  is  used  in  lieu  of  accrued  annual  leave,  management  will  not  approve restoration of an equal number of "use or lose" annual leave hours.    Accumulated  compensatory  time  for  travel  will  not  be  approved  for  use  while  the  employee  is  in travel status if the government must incur additional costs, e.g., for per diem.    5.  Forfeiture    The  employee  must  follow  the  Mission's  established  procedures  for  requesting  approval  to  use  earned compensatory time.  Compensatory time for travel is forfeited if not used within 26 pay  periods after the pay period in which it was earned; upon transfer to another agency; and upon  separation from the Mission.    Under  no  circumstances  may  an  employee  receive  payment  for  unused  compensatory  time  off  for travel.  The Department will not approve any exceptions.

SECTION C - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT C.1 PURPOSE

The purpose of this contract is to provide USAID/Colombia with technical and advisory services for evaluation activities at the mission (operating unit) level. This includes designing and implementing both quantitative and qualitative evaluation studies and assessments as well as providing evaluation technical assistance for USAID/Colombia development programs. These efforts will facilitate informed program management decisions, shape the longer-term strategic direction of programs and decision-making within the Mission, and enable USAID/Colombia to comply with USAID's Evaluation Policy. C.2 BACKGROUND

Drawing on lessons learned from Plan Colombia, in recent years USAID has focused its strategy to be more engaged with the Government of Colombia (GOC) and prioritized parts of the country that are strategically critical to ending the armed conflict. The following summary of Mission Development Objectives (DOs) provides context and a brief overall review of the scope and variety of activities underway in Colombia, which should be taken into account by the Offeror when developing their proposal. DO 1: Licit Livelihoods in Targeted Geographic Regions Expanded The Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI) is a USG interagency effort to assist the GOC to transition definitively out of conflict and put an end to illicit activities particularly cultivation, processing and trafficking of illegal narcotics. Achievement of these two objectives requires that the GOC gain effective control over the entirety of its territory and particularly over large sections of the country where the constitutional government has been unable or unwilling to establish a permanent state presence and exert full authority including extension of the rule of the law. USAID programs under this DO constitute a major contribution to the broader USG interagency CSDI effort, the overall objective of which is to assist Colombia to implement its National Consolidation Plan. USAID programs support expansion of GOC state presence and authority in priority geographic areas, and assist national and sub-national government entities to effectively implement key national policies and programs to address root causes of conflict. This assistance includes short- and long-term income-generating activities, efforts to increase community cohesion and civic values, and support to local governments to build their capacities to effectively respond to the needs of their constituents by delivering basic services and guaranteeing formal land tenure and effective return of property rights to those affected by conflict. Consolidation's goal is to put in place the capacity for small producers and municipal governments to be able to replicate the approach without USAID assistance. DO 2: Conditions of Targeted Vulnerable Populations Improved DO2 will facilitate improved conditions for targeted vulnerable populations that have been historically marginalized and conflict-affected in Colombia. A critical tenet of this strategy is support to the GOC's renewed commitment to victims of armed conflict through the Victims Law. The Victims Law mandates the restoration of the rights of Colombia's conflict victims through specialized assistance programs, including psychosocial and physical rehabilitation. It also includes transitional justice programs to provide reparations and advance truth and historical memory of the conflict. A second tenet of DO2 is reducing the impact of illegal armed groups (IAGs) in targeted communities through community reintegration programs for demobilized excombatants and the prevention of recruitment of children. Should the GOC successfully engage in peace processes with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National

Page 11 of 126

Liberation Army (ELN) or other IAGs, USAID will support that process through DO2. The final tenet of DO2 is empowerment of ethnic minorities for greater socioeconomic and political inclusion through interventions to improve their livelihoods, strengthen governance of their territories, and increase respect for ethnic and cultural diversity. DO 3: Strengthened Democratic and Economic Governance and Respect for Human Rights DO 3 is focused on strengthening democratic and economic governance, increasing access to justice, fostering greater political participation and more transparent elections, implementing effective public policies, strengthening labor unions, and promoting human rights. While notable advances have been achieved in these areas in the past several years, this DO seeks to further consolidate progress and align many efforts in support of Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI) which, in turn, supports the GOC's National Consolidation Plan. This requires work at both the national level and in the regions. This DO directly contributes to the Mission's overall goal of improving economic and social conditions of vulnerable Colombians with effective rights-based institutional presence. DO 4: Threats to Biodiversity Reduced and Impacts from Climate Change Decreased More than 40% of Colombia's territory has been declared an environmentally-protected area, including national parks, indigenous reservations, and Afro-Colombian collective lands. Natural resource-based livelihoods are a way of life for many vulnerable communities that live in and around Colombia's sensitive or protected ecosystems. These livelihoods and ecosystem conservation are both threatened by agents of environmental change, including deforestation, habitat conversion, overexploitation, invasive species, climate change, narco-trafficking, violence, and armed conflict. DO 4 works to eliminate or reduce the negative impacts on Colombia's biodiversity and ecosystem by using a "threats-based" approach to support the GOC. Under this approach, USAID works with the GOC, regional and local environmental institutions, and communities to do the following: strengthen environmental governance for the conservation of protected areas and ethnic territories; preserve, restore, or improve ecosystem services; ensure the environmental sustainability of natural resource-based livelihoods; mitigate or adapt to long-term impacts of climate change; and promote the use of renewable and clean energy. C.3 TECHNICAL SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED

The Contractor will provide USAID/Colombia with technical and advisory services to design and implement: performance evaluations1, impact evaluations2, assessments3 and other analyses and components of evaluations (e.g. baselines, cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness assessments). These qualitative and/or quantitative evaluations and assessments may be at the country, DO, program, project, area/component, and/or activity-level. USAID/Colombia has identified a preliminary list of evaluation studies, which are summarized below. Planned evaluations may be modified in the future due to USAID/Colombia's senior management request, funding changes, changes in the Mission's Performance Management Plan or evaluation agenda, or USAID decisions to perform joint evaluations and assessments with other donors. USAID will confirm scheduled evaluations through the Contractor's annual workplan. While assessments and other analyses will be conducted under this contract, the majority of tasks will be evaluations. USAID/Colombia uses evaluations as part of the planning and management of development assistance. Evaluations are used to assess strategic and program results (per ADS Chapter 203) in order to do the following:

Page 12 of 126

1

Performance evaluations focus on what a particular project or program has achieved (either at an intermediate point or at the

conclusion); how it is being implemented; how it is perceived; whether expected results are occurring; and other questions pertinent to program design, management and decision making. Performance evaluations often incorporate before-after comparisons, but generally lack a rigorously defined counterfactual.
2

Impact evaluations measure the change in a development outcome that is attributable to a defined intervention; impact evaluations

are based on models of cause and effect and require a credible and rigorously defined counterfactual to control for factors other than the intervention that might account for the observed change.
3

Assessments provide a comprehensive review of activities (conducted by USAID, host governments or other institution) in a given

development sector of a specific country or region and the institutional, environmental, and policy context in which these activities occur. Assessments highlight issues prevailing in the sector and identify possible approaches to address these issues. Assessments inform the strategy design and revision process of donors and host country partners. Evaluation is distinct from assessment.

Page 13 of 126

1. Inform new program and activity design; 2. Assess why unexpected progress, either positive or negative, is occurring; 3. Determine if the activity is achieving the intended results and identify needed mid-project corrections (mid-term or formative evaluation4); 4. Re-examine or test the validity of hypotheses and assumptions embedded in strategic plans and results frameworks; 5. Determine whether the needs of intended customers are being served; 6. Identify, probe, and understand positive and negative unintended consequences or impacts of assistance programs; 7. Determine whether conditions for sustainability exist; 8. Conduct final and/or impact evaluations to determine the results achieved, and; 9. Distill lessons learned, which may be useful elsewhere in the Agency. The contract will require the following kinds of work: 1. Desk studies; 2. Background research and analytic expertise to plan and implement evaluations, assessments, analyses, and related results-oriented program planning; 3. Implementation planning, including team planning meetings, and research and sample designs for proposed studies; 4. Formative evaluations4 of program and project implementation and summative evaluations5 of program and project results (including experimental and quasi experimental designs and case studies) requiring primary data collection in the field; 5. Drafting, revising, editing, and preparing for publication (in both English and Spanish) evaluation reports, impact evaluations, meta-evaluations, syntheses, and other publications related to evaluations, assessments, and analyses; 6. Logistical and administrative support for field evaluations, assessments, and analyses; 7. Personnel to organize and implement workshops and seminars to disseminate study findings; 8. Provide input, as needed, to tools developed by the Mission and uploaded into Monitor, USAID Colombia's automated environmental compliance management system, such as the Evaluation Tracker, in order to ensure results dissemination and recommendation implementation; 9. Create, conduct, and analyze national or regional level population surveys of direct and indirect beneficiaries and control groups; includes use of list experiments to provide estimates pertaining to sensitive questions; 10. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis; and 11. Will include conducting mid-term and final evaluation surveys, as well as producing final reports for major evaluations that have baseline studies completed.
4

Formative evaluations take place during the course of project or program implementation and generally focus on improvements in

the management or substance of interventions that can take place during implementation.
5

Summative evaluations generally take place towards the end or after program or project implementation and focus on assessing

the outcomes and impact of programs and projects as a basis for future improvements and lessons learned.

The Contractor will provide all necessary logistical support, including travel arrangements (with required USAID clearances), meeting and interview arrangements, computer support5, team planning facilitation, and report editing and dissemination. The Contractor is also required to provide central management and oversight of the evaluation activities awarded under the contract. The Advisor will be the individual bearing primary responsibility for technical aspects of contract performance. C.4 I. EXPECTED EVALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS Impact Evaluations

The contractor is required to conduct the following impact evaluations of USAID assistance under each Development Objective (DO). Impact evaluations will construct a counterfactual case of what would have occurred in the absence of USAID intervention. Tasks for impact evaluations will include but are not limited to the design of the evaluation approach, including the design of the counterfactual, collection of baseline data, reconstruction of baseline information (in the event a baseline was not collected for an activity), mid-term and final data collection, analysis and dissemination of results. All evaluation designs must be approved by the USAID/Colombia COR. The USAID/Colombia COR will share evaluation designs with countrylevel stakeholders and implementing partners before approval. Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI) Mid-Term Due: Nov 2014 Final Due: Aug 2016 Duration: 2010-2016 Total Project Estimated Investment: $235 million Objective: Civilian Government Presence in CSDI Zones Consolidated Background: The USAID/Colombia strategy for 2010 to 2014 supports the Government of Colombia's (GOC) National Consolidation Plan (PNC), which focuses on priority municipalities in rural zones that have been most affected by the armed conflict and illicit economic activities, and where the presence of the State in terms of security, services, and participation is particularly weak. The PNC seeks to restore State presence in these areas and improve living conditions through a consolidation process. USAID (and other agencies of the U.S. Government present in Colombia) will implement the U.S. Embassy Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI) through collaboration with the GOC consolidation activities in priority rural municipalities in four of these zones ­ Montes de Maria (in the departments of Bolivar and Sucre), the Central Zone (departments of Tolima and Meta), the northern zone (Cordoba and Antioquia), and the southern zone (Narińo and Caquetá). This impact evaluation focuses on USAID programs in these four CSDI zones. Currently a baseline analysis is being conducted, which is expected to be completed by March 2013. The baseline phase includes over 20,000 surveys of direct beneficiaries, indirect beneficiaries, and control groups, and is expected to provide deep insight into a wide array of social issues, including levels of illicit livelihoods, influence by illegal armed groups, government investments, citizen participation, social capital, perceptions and confidence in the government, land-related conflict, and economic and food security conditions.
Computer support refers to the Contractor providing computers (laptops), software, central processing (statistical analysis) where needed, etc. for all staff working on delivery orders.

Afro-Colombian and Indigenous Program (ACIP) Mid-Term Due: Nov 2014 Final Due: Aug 2016 Duration: 2011-2016 Total Project Estimated Investment: $61 million Objective: Improve socio-economic conditions and governance capacity of targeted AfroColombian and indigenous communities. Background: Citizen participation and engagement through the inclusion of ethnic minorities and disenfranchised persons is a priority in building foundations for a peaceful future in Colombia. Afro-Colombians constitute approximately 11 percent of Colombia's population of 45 million. The Colombian government legally recognizes 82 indigenous communities, constituting 3.4 percent of the population. Both populations are among the most marginalized, disproportionately suffering from displacement, violence, previous massacres and the breakdown of traditional social structures and cultural identity. While not all Afro-Colombian and Indigenous populations in Colombia have been direct victims of the armed conflict, many are among the historically excluded and poor communities of Colombia. The evaluation will measure the socio-economic improvements of ethnic minorities in Colombia, achieved as a result of activities implemented under the $61 million, five-year ACIP project. The implementation of the baseline is expected to be completed by the August 2013, and is expected to provide additional insights into the conditions and needs of these populations, and will help guide out-year programming. Victims Program Due: July 2015 Duration: 2012-2015 Total Program Estimated Investment: $90 million Objectives: (1)To provide technical assistance to the GOC for the first three years of the implementation of the Victims' Law to ensure that effective institutions, policies and systems at all levels--national, departmental and municipal--are established and operational. (2) To support victims at the local level to advocate, monitor and validate the GOC's effective implementation of the Victims' Law. (3) Implement activities directly with the GOC to continue activities prioritized under the Objective (1), the full Activity Description will be developed and implemented in FY2014. Background: Colombia has over four million victims of conflict, the majority of which are internally displaced persons (IDP's). In June 2011, the GOC passed the Victims' Assistance and Reparation and Land Restitution Law (Victims' Law), which responds to long-standing issues faced by the country's conflict victims in a comprehensive, rights-based way. The Victims' Law acknowledges that Colombia suffers from an internal armed conflict and addresses the causes and consequences of the conflict. To improve the conditions of conflict victims, OVP supports government socioeconomic assistance to victims of armed conflict, restore land tenure and property rights, and advance transitional justice processes. Green House Gas Emissions (DO level) Due: Sept 2015 Duration: 2010-2015 Total Program Estimated Investment: $60 million Objective: The GHG Emissions evaluation at DO level aims at evaluating the effectiveness of

Page 16 of 126

our climate change programs in terms of carbon emission reductions. In doing this, the contractor shall review all the activities by the environment team on climate change mitigation (including REDD+ projects), clean energy and LEDS (low emission development strategy). The contractor should produce a report highlighting the reductions achieved by each activity in terms of avoided tons of carbon released into the atmosphere as a result of the USAID activities. To achieve the objective, the contractor should engage with USAID partners (in Colombia as well as in the US), GOC institutions (emphasis on IDEAM -Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales de Colombia-, Ministry of Environment), local organizations including communities, when relevant. Background: The USAID environment program supports: biodiversity, climate change-mitigation (REDD), and climate change ­ adaptation activities in the Choco and Caribbean regions, as well as in the pacific and amazon regions. It also supports energy efficiency, renewable energy in off-grid areas, and finance and regulation (barriers for renewable investment) to connect financing to industries interested in upgrading or converting facilities to more efficient production processes as well as new technologies such as methane capture and gasification. The program also assists the Government of Colombia in the cross-sectoral coordination of their Low Carbon Development planning and implementation. Access to Justice (AJP) Mid-Term Due: Feb 2014 Final Due: Sept 2016 Duration: 2012-2016 Total Project Estimated Investment: $24 million Objective: Improved access to justice in conflict areas. Background: The objectives of this nation-wide program are to: 1) promote greater access to justice primarily through the services offered by Justice Houses and alternate dispute resolution mechanisms, 2) provide support to institutions and organizations at the municipal level to assist in helping to meet the justice needs of women, and 3) support justice sector institutions to implement reforms that improve productivity and the quality of services delivered, especially where reforms have an impact on justice sector performance in consolidation regions. Land and Livelihoods Project Mid-Term Due: Feb 2014 Final Due: Sept 2016 Duration: 2012-2016 Total Project Estimated Investment: $75 million Objective: The overall goal of USAID's proposed land and livelihood strategy is to support the GOC's land and livelihoods initiative to address the needs of the victims of conflict and put an end to Colombia's ongoing armed dispute over rights to control land and natural resources. The proposed strategy reflects USAID's analysis that the broad contours of a transformative land and development policy framework have been effectively outlined by the GOC in a way that can resolve root causes and address major consequences of the internal conflict in Colombia. Background: Current circumstances and political will provide a unique opportunity for USAID to catalyze potentially transformational change in Colombia. Over the past decade, Colombia has made remarkable progress towards transforming itself from a conflict-ravaged, fragile state to a stable, market-led democracy capable of assuming a vital regional leadership role and solidifying its status as a key US strategic partner. The US-Colombia Free Trade Agreement

Page 17 of 126

ratified in 2011 reflects the new direction that Colombia has set for itself. Despite progress achieved to date, Colombia's transformation to a post-conflict country is neither complete nor irreversible. Sustained, strategically focused USAID support over the next five years can be instrumental in assisting the Government of Colombia to cross the threshold. II. Performance Evaluations

The Contractor will be required to conduct the following mid-term and/or final performance evaluations of USAID projects. Tasks for performance evaluations may include but are not limited to the design of the evaluation approach, baseline reconstruction, data collection, analysis and dissemination of results. All evaluation designs must be approved by the USAID/Colombia COR. Areas for Municipal-level Alternative Development (ADAM) Sustainability Assessment Due: May/June 2013 Duration: 2006-2010 Total Project Estimated Investment: $184 million Objective: Create licit economic opportunities, strengthen local government and develop infrastructure in some of the most vulnerable regions in Colombia. Background: ADAM aimed to develop and implement a sustainable, market-driven alternative development program to promote eradication of coca and poppies where they exist, and as importantly, impede drug cultivation in rural areas that are vulnerable to, but still free of illicit crops. The ADAM strategy is based on the premise that the key to sustainable economic development is the creation of strong, effective linkages among the governmental institutions, markets, and local producers. People-to-People Resolution of Land and Natural Resources Conflicts in Colombia (PROTIERRA) Due: May/June 2013 Duration: 2011-2013 Total Project Estimated Investment: $1.2 million Objective: Resolving land and natural resource conflicts Background: The project seeks to provide o implement the "People-to-People Resolution of Land and Natural Resources Conflicts in Colombia" (PROTIERRA) program, aimed at resolving land and natural resource conflicts in in nearly 230,000 hectares of land benefiting over 20,000 Afro-Colombian and indigenous people. Mercy Corps' approach combines the four dimensions of comprehensive conflict transformation (personal, relational, cultural and structural) to address factors that impede dialogue as a means for conflict resolution. The project is implemented in the region of Urabá and the Department of Quibdó. Mental Health Conflict Victims Due: May/June 2013 Duration: 2010-2012 Total Project Estimated Investment: $1.1 million Objective: To help develop a model for the provision of mental health services to victims of conflict in rural areas. Target areas are Corregimiento Las Palomas, Municipality of Montería, Córdoba (Northern Colombia) and Viotá, Cundinamarca (Central Colombia).

Attention for Landmine Victims in Colombia Due: May/June 2013 Duration: 2008-2013 Total Project Estimated Investment: $4.3 million Objective: This program addresses the needs of victims of the conflict through the development of inclusive and integrated approaches to rehabilitation; support to socio-economic activities for victims of war; support to education and training activities for rehabilitation professionals. The program seeks to use local capacity and leverages involvement from the private sector. The main strategies to accomplish this goal are as follows: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Provide medical and socio-economic assistance to landmine survivors, including income generation opportunities. Support the development of two new rehabilitation clinics in Narińo and Caquetá to strengthening emergency service provision Train prosthetic and orthotics technicians Improve attention to landmine survivors and PWDs through the promotion of policy initiatives.

BIO-REDD+ Due: Aug 2014 Duration: 2011-2014 Total Project Estimated Investment: $30 million Objective: Trough this activity USAID is supporting in biodiversity, climate change-mitigation (REDD), and climate change ­ adaptation activities in the Choco and Caribbean regions. Background: The major goals of this program are the establishment of at least eight financed REDD+ projects in the pacific region (1.5 million hectares) with Afro-Colombian communities, as well as the carbon baseline for the pacific and amazon regions in support of Colombia's regional REDD+ program. There are several sources of leveraged financing being used, one is a partnership with the Colombian government for productive projects ($3 million) and 2 MOUs signed with BNP Paribas ($5 million) and Bunge Emissions Group ($2 million). The latter two organizations are in the process of negotiating emissions purchase agreements with the communities under the USAID program. Human Rights Program III Due: March 2015 Duration: 2012-2015 Total Project Estimated Investment: $21 million Objective: The main objectives of the third program phase are to: 1) support a culture of human rights, 2) prevent abuse and violations of human rights, and 3) provide meaningful and efficient responses to human rights violations once they have occurred. III. Sector and Cross-Cutting Assessments

The Contractor will be required to conduct the following cross-cutting assessments to identify lessons learned and opportunities for enhancing performance. Assessment of the Activities Implemented Through Local Systems Due: Sept 2015 Duration: 2011-2015

Page 19 of 126

USAID is currently undergoing an agency-wide reform effort, known as USAID Forward: Implementation and Procurement Reform. The objective of this effort is to implement activities through local systems, including the strengthening of local civil society and private sector capacity to improve aid effectiveness and sustainability. USAID/Colombia is implementing across its portfolio several modalities to use local systems and to strengthen capacity and the assessment will look at the capacity development efforts of selected projects across its portfolio. The assessment will look at the best practices; cost-effectiveness and sustainability of approaches used, and will provide recommendations on how to improve capacity building efforts in a sustainable way. Tropical Forestry and Biodiversity (FAA 118 and 119) Analyses Due: March 2014 Duration: 2011-2015 Analysis of the actions necessary in Colombia to achieve conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests and conserve biological diversity; and review the extent to which current or proposed USAID/Colombia actions meet those needs. For more info, review http://transition.usaid.gov/our_work/environment/biodiversity/118_119_analyses.html

Future Evaluation Activities In the next five years USAID/Colombia expects to have the need for approximately six additional evaluations (Impact and Performance) and/or assessment activities. Under this contract the Contractor will perform future activities to be determined as needed. As evaluation activities are identified, the contract's work plan shall be updated to include the activity's objectives, scope, methodology, and timeline. C.5 I. STAFFING Overall Staffing

The services under this contract require skills in evaluation research design (including quantitative impact evaluation methods, experimental and quasi experimental design, and qualitative methods); sampling methods; data collection, analysis, and synthesis; report writing, and planning for use and dissemination of evaluation findings. The contract will also require skills in innovative and state-of-the-art research designs and methods, participatory evaluations, cost-benefit and cost-effective evaluation methods. While work may focus on specific sectors (economic growth and agricultural development; land tenure and rural development; environment and natural resources; democracy and governance; conflict mitigation and post conflict reconstruction, and humanitarian assistance), it may also cut across sector and technical areas. The contractor shall establish a small core team of experts and support staff to effectively implement the Activity. All staff may be headquartered in Bogota, however, Key Personnel and staff must be available to travel throughout Colombia to attend to contract implementation tasks. Rather than expanding the core team, the contractor is encouraged to maximize the use of Colombian organizations and experts to conduct activities that require an expansion beyond the capacity of the core team. It should be understood that the purpose of the use of local expertise is not just to achieve the tasks under each component, but to leave capacity to continue similar activities in Colombia. Therefore, the contractor will be expected to strengthen and not just use local capacity.

(e)

(f) H.13

(a) The objectives of the USAID Disability Policy are (1) to enhance the attainment of United States foreign assistance program goals by promoting the participation and equalization of opportunities of individuals with disabilities in USAID policy, country and sector strategies, activity designs and implementation; (2) to increase awareness of issues of people with disabilities both within USAID programs and in host countries; (3) to engage other U.S. government agencies, host country counterparts, governments, implementing organizations and other donors in fostering a climate of nondiscrimination against people with disabilities; and (4) to support international advocacy for people with disabilities. The full text of the policy paper can be found at the following website: <http://www.usaid.gov/about/disability/DISABPOL.FIN.html>. (b) USAID therefore requires that the contractor not discriminate against people with disabilities in the implementation of USAID programs and that it make every effort to comply with the objectives of the USAID Disability Policy in performing this contract. To that end and within the scope of the contract, the contractor's actions must demonstrate a comprehensive and consistent approach for including men, women and children with disabilities.

Acceptable software formats for electronic documents include, Microsoft Word, Word Perfect, Microsoft Excel, and Portable Document Format (PDF). USAID will accept an electronic signature from the contractor's duly appointed or specifically identified engagement authority for a given contract action. H.16 SECURITY CONDITIONS

Contractor must be aware of security conditions in Colombia, and by entering into the contract, assumes full responsibility for the safety of its employees. Prior to commencing work in Colombia, the Contractor shall ensure that it has adequate procedures in place to advise its employees of situations or changed conditions that could adversely affect their security. In order to keep abreast of security conditions in Colombia, but particularly before any employee travels outside of Bogota, the Contractor shall seek information from all available sources, including the USAID/Colombia executive office, for all areas in which its employees work or travel. Contractor acknowledges that security conditions are subject to change at any moment, that USAID cannot guarantee the accuracy of any information that it may provide to the Contractor and that USAID assumes no responsibility for the reliability of such information. The Contractor has sole responsibility for approving all travel plans for its employees. The Contractor is also responsible for immediately notifying USAID/Colombia and the US Embassy American Citizen Services section in the event a US citizen employee does not return from travel as expected. In the event that USAID requests the Contractor to do so, the Contractor's chief of party shall assume responsibility for contacting all of its employees. The Contractor shall provide to the USAID/Colombia executive office the name, current address, and current home and/or cellular telephone number of the chief of party and of an alternate designated employee. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that the information on file in the USAID/Colombia executive office is up-to-date so that in an emergency, the chief of party or alternate representative can be reached immediately and he/she can rapidly contact all other affected employees. H.17 SECURITY PROTOCOL

The Contractor will develop a security plan to safeguard all project operations and to comply with all United States Government regulations. The plan is to be implemented and maintained by all subcontractors (and/or sub-grantees) as well. The security plan will be approved by the COR in consultation with the USAID Mission's Security Officer. The plan must include: ˇ Procedures for reporting and addressing security threats.

Page 48 of 126

ˇ ˇ

Procedures for reporting any deaths related to the project. Procedures for reporting and addressing any persons missing or kidnapping incidents.

ˇ Name and contact information of security contact person for the head office and regional office(s). ˇ An internal "cascade" list for communicating with staff which should be updated/ maintained by the contractor/grantee. The prime contractor/grantee will provide the name, address and telephone numbers of the COP and their designee to USAID as principle contacts in case of security situations/emergencies. Contractor/grantees would be responsible for passing information to their staff. H.18 SECURITY REPORTING

As part of the overall security requirements, the Contractor and its subcontractors shall report any security threats verbally immediately to the COR and subsequently in writing to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with approved procedures. The contractor shall develop a list of specific steps to track any potential/identified threats, which would be part of an overall security system. H.19 LIFE SUPPORT AND SECURITY SERVICES

The Contractor is responsible for maintaining the security of its personnel, materials and equipment commensurate with the circumstances involved. All employees of the Contractor must meet the requirements of their work-site which may include background checks, security/restricted area clearance, drug-free workplace, safety training and/or other inspections/requirements. H.20 OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT

USAID/Colombia conducts public affairs efforts to highlight the role and contribution of U.S. assistance programs in Colombia as a way to raise public awareness, understanding, and support for USG-funded goals and activities. The contractor will enhance USAID's outreach and communications efforts in two dimensions. The first dimension is outreach to domestic audiences. This effort will focus on describing and explaining USAID's efforts to assist the people and government of Colombia to address the human rights needs of the country's citizens. The second dimension, if appropriate, is to strengthen local counterparts' ability to increase public and private commitment and community support to ensure program success and sustainability by publicizing successful stories. USAID encourages the contractor to coordinate training activities with counterparts ­ at the regional and local levels ­ to strengthen their outreach efforts to build and support external commitment. Toward this end, the contractor will prepare and share with USAID updated fact sheets and at least one success story describing the impact of the program in each quarterly technical report. In addition, the contractor will coordinate with the COR and USAID's Information and Communications Office to provide information on the assistance programs and activities, and collaborate on public diplomacy events and VIP visits. H.21 PROHIBITION OF ASSISTANCE TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT FORCES IN COLOMBIA

Page 49 of 126

United States law currently prohibits assistance to a country's law enforcement forces in the absence of a statutory exception or other authority. U.S. law also prohibits assistance to a unit of the security forces of a country, if the U.S. Government has credible evidence that the unit has committed gross violations of human rights (the Leahy Amendment). Any assistance can only be provided upon USAID's exercise of an available exception/authority, and subject to contractor cooperation in the vetting procedures used for compliance with the Leahy Amendment. Please be advised that USAID will not identify, in advance, units of security forces for which there is evidence of "gross violations of human rights." For purpose of clarification, "security forces" are understood to be units of law enforcement or the military. Prison guards, customs police, border police, tax police, and the coast guard are examples of the types of units included in the category of "security forces." Examples of persons who are not considered "security forces" include government bureaucrats, prosecutors, judges and forensic lab workers. A "unit" of a security force is the lowest organizational element capable of exercising command and discipline over its members. H.22 SUBCONTRACTING PLAN AND THE SF 294 ­ SUBCONTRACTING REPORT FOR INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS AND SF 295 ­ SUMMARY CONTRACTING REPORT

(a) The U.S. Government is opposed to prostitution and related activities, which are inherently harmful and dehumanizing, and contribute to the phenomenon of trafficking in persons. None of the funds made available under this contract may be used to promote, support, or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution. Nothing in the immediately preceding sentence shall be construed to preclude assistance designed to ameliorate the suffering of, or health risks to, victims while they are being trafficked or after they are out of the situation that resulted from such victims being trafficked. (b) The contractor shall insert this clause, in its entirety, in all sub-awards under this award. (c) This provision includes express terms and conditions of the contract and any violation of it shall be grounds for unilateral termination of the contract, in whole or in part, by USAID prior to the end of the term. H.26 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

a) The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, Section 117 requires that the impact of USAID's activities on the environment be considered and that USAID include environmental sustainability as a central consideration in designing and carrying out its development programs. This mandate is codified in Federal Regulations (22 CFR 216) and in USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS) Parts 201.5.10g and 204 (http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/200/), which, in part, require that the potential environmental impacts of USAID-financed activities are identified prior to a final decision to proceed and that appropriate environmental safeguards are adopted for all activities. Offeror/contractor environmental compliance obligations under these regulations and procedures are specified in the following paragraphs of this RFP/contract. b) In addition, the contractor/recipient must comply with host country environmental regulations unless otherwise directed in writing by USAID. In case of conflict between host country and USAID regulations, the latter shall govern. c) No activity funded under this contract will be implemented unless an environmental threshold determination, as defined by 22 CFR 216, has been reached for that activity, as documented in a Request for Categorical Exclusion (RCE), Initial Environmental Examination (IEE), or Environmental Assessment (EA) duly signed by the Bureau Environmental Officer (BEO). (Hereinafter, such documents are described as "approved Regulation 216 environmental documentation.") d) An Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) has been approved for the USAID Colombia Democracy & Human Rights Program, including this RFP/contract, and for activities to be undertaken herein [LAC-IEE-11-40]. Pursuant to 22 CFR 216.2 (c) (2) a Categorical Exclusion is issued for the following types of activities:

Education, technical assistance, or training programs except to the extent such training programs include activities directly affecting the environment (such as construction of facilities, etc.); Analyses, studies, academic or research workshops and meetings; Matching, general support and institutional support grants provided to private voluntary organizations (PVOs) to assist in financing programs where AID's objective is providing such financing does not require knowledge of or control over the details of the specific activities conducted by the PVOs; Studies, projects or programs intended to develop the capability of recipient countries to engage in development planning, except to the extent designed to result in activities directly affecting the environment (such as construction of facilities, etc.)

e) As part of its initial Work Plan, and all Annual Work Plans thereafter, the contractor, in collaboration with the USAID Cognizant Technical Officer and Mission Environmental Officer or Bureau Environmental Officer, as appropriate, shall review all ongoing and planned activities under this contract to determine if they are within the scope of the approved Regulation 216 environmental documentation. f) If the contractor plans any new activities outside the scope of the approved Regulation 216 environmental documentation, it shall prepare an amendment to the documentation for USAID review and approval. No such new activities shall be undertaken prior to receiving written USAID approval of environmental documentation amendments.

g) Any ongoing activities found to be outside the scope of the approved Regulation 216 environmental documentation shall be halted until an amendment to the documentation is submitted and written approval is received from USAID.

AIDAR 722.170 EMPLOYMENT OF THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS (TCN'S) AND COOPERATING COUNTRY NATIONALS (CCN'S)

(a) General. It is USAID policy that cooperating country nationals (CCN'S) and third country nationals (TCN's), who are hired abroad for work in a cooperating country under USAID-direct

Page 54 of 126

contracts, generally be extended the same benefits, and be subject to the same restrictions as TCN's and CCN's employed as direct hires by the USAID Mission. Exceptions to this policy may be granted either by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project. (TCN's and CCN's who are hired to work in the United States shall be extended benefits and subject to restrictions on the same basis as U.S. citizens who work in the United States.) (b) Compensation. Compensation, including merit or promotion increases paid to TCN's and CCN's may not, without the approval of the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project, exceed the prevailing compensation paid to personnel performing comparable work in the cooperating country as determined by the USAID Mission. Unless otherwise authorized by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project, the compensation of such TCN and CCN employees shall be paid in the currency of the cooperating country. (c) Allowances and differentials. TCN's and CCN's, hired abroad for work in a cooperating country, are not eligible for allowances or differentials under USAID-direct contracts, unless authorized by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project. (d) Country and security clearances. The contractor shall insure that the necessary clearances, including security clearances, if required, have been obtained for TCN and CCN employees in accordance with any such requirements set forth in the contract or required by the USAID Mission, prior to the TCN or CCN starting work under the contract. (e) Physical fitness. Contractors are required to insure that prospective TCN and CCN employees are examined prior to employment to determine whether the prospective employee meets the minimum physical requirements of the position and is free from any contagious disease. (f) Workweek, holidays, and leave. The workweek, holidays, and leave for TCN and CCN employees shall be the same as for all other employees of the contractor, under the terms of the contract; however, TCN and CCN employees are not eligible for home leave or military leave unless authorized by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the project. (g) Travel and transportation for TCN's and CCN's. Travel and transportation shall be provided TCN and CCN employees on the same basis as for all other employees of the contractor, under the terms of the contract. (h) Household effects and motor vehicles. USAID will not provide household effects to TCN and CCN employees; such employees may ship their household effects and motor vehicles to their place of employment on the same basis as for all other employees of the contractor, under the terms of the contract unless they are residents of the cooperating country. H.30 NONEXPENDABLE PROPERTY PURCHASES AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES

The Contractor shall comply with the requirements contained in ADS 548 which require review and approval by the Office of Information Resource Management (M/IRM) in USAID/W of

information technology components in which the life-cycle cost of commodities or services (e.g., installation, maintenance, and technical assistance) exceeds $100,000. 1. Pursuant to ADS 547, Information Technology (IT) is defined as follows: Information Technology (A) The term `information technology', with respect to an executive agency means any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment, that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the executive agency. For purposes of the preceding sentence, equipment is used by an executive agency if the equipment is used by the executive agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with the executive agency which (i) requires the use of such equipment, or (ii) requires the use, to a significant extent, of such equipment in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product. (B) The term `information technology' includes computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services), and related resources. (C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), the term `information technology' does not include any equipment that is acquired by a Federal contractor incidental to a Federal contract. (Source: Clinger-Cohen Act) (Chapters 541-548, 552) 2. The Contractor shall maintain accountable property records of IT resources. These records must identify each accountable item of U.S. Government-funded property acquired or furnished under the contract in a format acceptable to the Contracting Officer and must be furnished to the Contracting Officer six months after the effective date of the contract or task order and thereafter annually based on the effective date of the contract. In the event any IT resources are lost, stolen, destroyed or damaged beyond economical repair, the Contractor must promptly notify both the COR and the Contracting Officer. 3. As part of the Property Disposition Plan, the Contractor will provide a separate and final inventory of sensitive property. Sensitive property is property potentially dangerous to the public safety or security if stolen, lost, or misplaced, or that shall be subject to exceptional physical security, protection, control, and accountability.

CONSENT TO SUBCONTRACT

In accordance with Contract FAR clause 52.244-2, Subcontracts, the Contracting Officer consents to award of subcontracts as proposed in the Contractor's proposal which resulted in the award of this Contract to the following firms for the products or services specified here: Contractor Name Services to be Performed Amount The Contractor must request Contracting Officer consent and submit the information required by the aforementioned clause for any subcontracts requiring consent but not listed here. H.34 (a) CONFLICT OF INTEREST It is understood and agreed that some of the work required hereunder may place the Contractor, or its personnel or its subcontractors or their personnel (hereinafter referred to collectively as "Contractor"), in the position of having a potential personal or organizational conflict of interest (OCI), i.e., because of other activities or relationships with other persons, (1) the Contractor is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice; or (2) the Contractor's objectivity in performing the contract is or might be impaired; or (3) the Contractor may receive an unfair competitive advantage; or (4) the Contractor may have a financial or other personal interest which would or potentially would impair his/her objectivity and/or from which he/she would improperly benefit. Further discussion of OCIs may be found in FAR 9.5. The performance/actions of personnel under this contract will be imputed to the Contractor (or subcontractor) by whom they are employed or retained, and the performance/actions of any subcontractor will be imputed to the Contractor, unless the Contractor, on a case-by-case basis, can demonstrate otherwise and satisfy the Contracting Officer that such imputation is unreasonable. In accordance with the clause of this contract entitled "Organizational Conflicts of Interest Discovered after Award" (AIDAR 752.209-71); the Contractor agrees not to undertake any activity which may involve a personal conflict of interest or an OCI without first notifying the Contracting Officer of such potential conflict and receiving the Contracting Officer's authorization to undertake that activity.

(b)

(c)

Page 57 of 126

(d)

If the potential conflict relates to performance of the work hereunder (e.g., where the Contractor is to evaluate an activity in which the Contractor had some previous involvement, thereby rendering the Contractor unable or potentially unable to provide impartial assistance or advice, or impairing or potentially impairing the Contractor's objectivity), and the Contracting Officer cannot neutralize, mitigate, or avoid the conflict, the Contracting Officer may decline to authorize performance of that work by the Contractor. If the potential conflict relates to future activities (e.g., where the Contractor is to perform a needs assessment, feasibility study, or design/development of a project or activity to be procured under another contract for which the Contractor will or might compete or which may be awarded noncompetitively to the Contractor, thereby potentially providing an unfair competitive advantage to the Contractor, and/or rendering the Contractor unable or potentially unable to provide impartial assistance or advice, or impairing or potentially impairing the Contractor's objectivity; or where the work under this contract might affect the personal or financial interests of the Contractor), the Contracting Officer may decline to authorize performance of that work by the Contractor or, if such work is authorized, the Contracting Officer may place restrictions on the Contractor's future activities, as permitted by FAR 9.5., and as necessary to neutralize, mitigate, or avoid the potential conflict. The Contracting Officer's approval to undertake such activities, if given, may be based on the Contracting Officer's determination that a significant potential conflict does not exist or does not appear to exist, or may be conditioned on the acceptance by the Contractor of restrictions on the Contractor's future activities. If restrictions are to be placed on future activities, the Contractor may decline to perform the work. If it is discovered that the Contractor engaged in any activities which constitute a potential or actual conflict without having first obtained the Contracting Officer's approval to undertake such activities; or if it is subsequently discovered that, notwithstanding the Contracting Officer's authorization to undertake the activity based on his/her initial determination that no significant potential conflict existed or appeared to exist, a conflict did, in fact exist or arise, restrictions, as permitted by FAR 9.5, on the Contractor's future activities may be placed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer for this contract or the Contracting Officer for such other contract as may be involved in the conflict, and other remedies (including termination of this contract for default, debarment or suspension, and those permitted by the clauses of this contract entitled "Cancellation, Rescission, and Recovery of Funds for Illegal or Improper Activity" (FAR 52.203-8) and "Price or Fee Adjustment for Illegal or Improper Activity" [FAR 52.203-10]), may be taken by USAID. If it is discovered that the Contractor engaged in any activities in violation of the restrictions placed by a Contracting Officer on the Contractor's future activities, other remedies (including termination of this contract for default, debarment or suspension, and those permitted by the clauses of this contract entitled "Cancellation, Rescission, and Recovery of Funds for Illegal or Improper Activity" (FAR 52.203-8) and "Price or Fee Adjustment for Illegal or Improper Activity" [FAR 52.203-10]), may be taken by USAID.

To the greatest extent possible, the Contractor shall seek to include both men and women in all aspects of this program including participation and leadership in [e.g., meetings, training, etc.]. The Contractor shall collect, analyze and submit to USAID sex-disaggregated data and proposed actions that will address any identified gender-related issues. Further requirements on this are included in Section C. USAID policy requires that gender issues be addressed as appropriate in all USAID-funded activities. The technical approach should describe how gender considerations will be integrated throughout the program and into specific activities as appropriate. The Contractor must look for gender implications or opportunities in the program, seeking to address embedded gender issues and promote gender equity, as appropriate, in all phases of program implementation and internal management. This program must address gender concerns in a fundamental way ­ simply setting aside funds for training of female council members, for example, will not alone be considered sufficient. Specific activities for women are appropriate. Gender indicators should be defined and tracked by the Contractor and the contractor will complete an analysis of gender as part of its initial stages of implementation. H.36 TRANSITION OF KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND ABILITIES

Local capacity building is one of the principal objectives of this contract. To that end, special consideration should be given to the involvement of local firms and professionals in significant roles in order to facilitate future transfer of knowledge, skills, and abilities. The Contractor shall take into consideration the objective of sustainability. Sustainability will be determined by the capacity of Peruvian evaluation providers, and their ability to produce quality evaluations after the program ends. Local organizations will be supported, utilized, and/or built to the greatest extent possible, in order to carry out program interventions. Those organizations should become sustainable as a matter of a deliverable, not merely as a goal. Therefore, the Contractor shall take all deliberate steps necessary to ensure: (a) Maximum transfer of program management skills, tools, and methods to local firms and organizations; Maximum business opportunities for local firms; and Maximum employment opportunity for local citizens at all levels, from program management positions to unskilled labor. AIDAR 752.7032 INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL APPROVAL AND NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND AIDAR 752.7027 PERSONNEL

(b) (a)

H.37

In accordance with the clearance/approval requirements in paragraph (a) of AIDAR 752.7027 Personnel (DEC 1990) (incorporated in Section I) and AIDAR 752.7032 International Travel Approval and Notification Requirements (JAN 1990) (incorporated in Section I), the Contracting Officer hereby provides prior written approval for all travel included in the approved contract budget, provided that the Contractor obtains the COR's written concurrence with the assignment of individuals outside the United States before the assignment abroad, which must be within the terms of this contract, is subject to availability of funds, and should not be construed as authorization either to increase the estimated cost or to exceed the obligated amount (see Section B). The Contractor shall retain for audit purposes a copy of each travel concurrence. Any travel in addition to that included in the approved budget, shall require

Page 59 of 126

prior approval of the Contracting Officer, as required under AIDAR 752.7032 International Travel Approval and Notification Requirements (JAN 1990).

H.38 (a)

PERSONAL IDENTITY VERIFICATION OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL (July 2007) Before a contractor (or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo. One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.) USAID/Washington contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer. Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems. All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/Washington or Mission Security Briefing. The contractor or his/her Facilities Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first. The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures, as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPD-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures. This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/Washington and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office. The contractor is required to include this provision in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems. HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) (SEPTEMBER 2006)

(b)

(c)

H.39

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12. HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems. USAID will begin issuing HSPD-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach. Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new Contractors (and new Contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems. USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing Contractors (and existing Contractor employees) on October 27, 2007. (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing Contractor (or Contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to Oct 27, 2007. In those situations, the existing Contractor (or

Page 60 of 126

Contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.) Accordingly, before a Contractor (including a Personal Services Contract or a Contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo. One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.) USAID/W Contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and Contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer. Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the Contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems. All Contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing. The Contractor or his/her Facilities Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the Contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first. The Contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures, as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPD-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures. This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/Washington and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office. In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontract that requires the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems. H.40 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT -- IMPROPER BUSINESS PRACTICES

Corruption or any other improper business practices related to this solicitation and any resulting contract(s) will not be tolerated. Transactions relating to the expenditure of public funds require the highest degree of public trust and an impeccable standard of conduct by contractors, subcontractors and any other agent acting in connection with this contract. Examples of such unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to providing or offering of bribes to any person associated with the contract or any subcontracts; soliciting or accepting kickbacks or bribes; and knowingly making any false or misleading accounting reports or financial statements. Contractors, subcontractors and any other agents acting under contracts awarded herein are expected to employ due diligence and have internal controls in place towards practicing good governance in execution of the contract. Any one of these entities found to have engaged in illegal activity, improper behavior, or corrupt practices will be subject to

Page 61 of 126

corrective actions in accordance with the respective FAR clause incorporated into this solicitation and any resulting contract(s). H.41 FOREIGN GOVERNMENT DELEGATIONS TO INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES

Funds in this contract may not be used to finance the travel, per diem, hotel expenses, meals, conference fees or other conference costs for any member of a foreign government's delegation to an international conference sponsored by a public international organization, except as provided in ADS Mandatory Reference "Guidance on Funding Foreign Government Delegations to International Conferences" [http://www.info.usaid.gov/pubs/ads/300/refindx3.htm] or as approved by the Contracting Officer. H.42 NONDISCRIMINATION (JUNE 2012)

(a) FAR Part 27 and the clauses prescribed in that part prohibit contractors performing in or recruiting from the U.S. from engaging in certain discriminatory practices. (b) USAID is committed to achieving and maintaining a diverse and representative workforce and a workplace free of discrimination. Based on law, Executive Order, and Agency policy, USAID prohibits discrimination in its own workplace on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, disability, age, veteran's status, sexual orientation, genetic information, marital status, parental status, political affiliation, and any other conduct that does not adversely affect the performance of the employee. USAID does not tolerate any type of harassment, either sexual or nonsexual, of any employee or applicant for employment. Contractors are required to comply with the nondiscrimination requirements of the FAR. (c) In addition, the Agency strongly encourages all its contractors (at all tiers) to develop and enforce comprehensive nondiscrimination policies for their workplaces that include protection on these expanded bases, subject to applicable law.

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-- (A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

Page 74 of 126

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. K.4 FAR 52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (FEB 2012)

(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-- "Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings).

(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision.

The technical proposal in response to this solicitation will address how the offeror intends to carry out the Statement of Work contained in Section C, in its entirety. It must reflect a clear understanding of the objectives, the deliverables and the responsibilities of all parties involved. The technical proposal should not merely repeat the contents of this RFP and Statement of Work; rather, it should offer original, critical thinking and analysis, related to each component and it should tie the technical approach to deliverables and results to be achieved. In addition to a brief Executive Summary, the Technical Proposal will include the information set forth below: 1. TECHNICAL APPROACH a. Problem Statement, Goals and Objectives: This section shall clearly describe the context in which the program will be implemented and the offeror's understanding of the critical challenges, needs and opportunities for promoting the objectives of the program described in Section C. A succinct description of the strategic vision and the proposed methodology must be provided along with a rationale for how, over the life of the program, this methodology will coherently reach the objectives envisioned. b. ˇ Proposed Interventions: Offerors must address in detail: How the proposed methodology will successfully address the objectives of the components as described in Section C, and the activities proposed under each Component in order to achieve the deliverables stated.

NOTE: (1) "Major sub-contractors" are those sub-contractors expected to perform at least 20% of the technical effort or to provide the majority professional expertise for a particular task of the contract statement of work, even if the sector is expected to be less than 20% of the effort under the entire contract. (2) Offerors must either submit the above information or affirmatively state that they possess no relevant directly related or similar performance experience. L.10 A. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL Terms/Conditions:

(1) Freedom of Information Act of 1981: Pursuant to this Act, the public is entitled to request information from Agency contract files. As a general rule, information will be disclosed except: (i) (ii) (iii) Information submitted in response to a Request for Proposal, prior to award of the contract or other instrument, or amendments thereto. Information properly classified or administratively controlled by the Government. Information specifically exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Upon award of contracts resulting from this solicitation, the Government will disclose, use or duplicate any information submitted in response to the solicitation to the extent provided in the contract and as required by the Freedom of Information Act.

(2) In case of any disagreements or discrepancies between the terms and conditions of this request for cost proposal and the FAR, the latter will prevail. (3) The Offeror will follow the instructions contained in this request for cost proposal and supply all information and signatures/certifications, as required. Failure to furnish all information requested may disqualify a proposal. (4) Offerors must set forth full, accurate and complete information as required by this request for cost proposal. The penalty for making false statements to the Government is prescribed in 18 U.S.C. 1001. B. Instructions:

The cost proposal shall be submitted under a separate file from the technical proposal. The cost proposal shall be in Excel 2010 and compatible with a MS Windows XP operating environment. All cost calculations (where applicable) shall be true self-calculating spreadsheets (formulated) and calculations and formulas must be visible. While there is no page limit, the Offerors are encouraged to be as concise as possible, but still provide the necessary detail to address the solicitation requirement. A budget format to be used by offerors is provided as Attachment 3 in Section J (Budget Template). The budget format to be submitted must be substantially similar to the one provided. Page 90 of 126

It contains two worksheets ­ a Summary Budget and a Detailed Budget. For each CLIN, the offerors shall provide a detailed budget (breakdown) with narratives explaining the basis for the estimate for each category of cost/input in sufficient detail to facilitate determination of cost reasonableness. The detailed budget must be rolled up in summary fashion into the line items in Section B.4, or as provided in the Budget Template. C. Content: (1) Standard Form (SF) 33 The Offeror must submit the cover page (Section A) of this Solicitation [Standard Form (SF) 33, "Solicitation, Offer, and Award"], with blocks 12 through 18 completed, with an original signature of a person authorized on behalf of the Offeror to sign the offer. (2) Proposed Costs/Prices Under requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Contracting Officer is responsible for determining reasonableness of prices. It is expected that adequate price competition will be obtained under this solicitation and that a determination of price reasonableness will be made in accordance with FAR 15.403-3. However, to establish cost realism, and the extent to which prices reflect performance addressed in the Technical Proposal, each offeror is required to submit cost or pricing data or information other than cost or pricing data with its proposal pursuant to FAR 52.215-20, Alternate IV. a. The offeror must fully comply with the requirements set forth in FAR 15.408, Table 152, I. General Instructions A, E, G and II. Cost. Include in your cost proposal sufficient detail to support and explain all costs proposed, giving figures and narrative explanation (A line-item narrative is requested for each of the budget line items included in the sample provided). Since an award may be made without further discussion, this data must be submitted with your proposal. b. The cost proposal must be prepared in a manner consistent with your current accounting system. Provide a statement verifying that you have an approved Accounting System, including the approval date and the name of the reviewing office. List any other systems, such as estimating, purchasing, compensation, and budgeting, that have been reviewed or are under review, showing the status, outstanding issues, approval date, and name of the reviewing office. Identify your cognizant U.S. Government Audit Office. If applicable, provide a copy of your most current Forward Pricing Rate Agreement, a statement on the status of your Cost Accounting Standards Disclosure Statement, and the status of any unresolved Cost Accounting Standard issues. c. USAID encourages the use of competitively awarded fixed price subcontracts for services that can be defined objectively and for which the risk of performance is manageable. Each cost-reimbursement, or sole source fixed price subcontract shall be supported in a similar manner consistent with the instructions provided under L.1 INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL, (2) Proposed Costs/Prices. Prospective subcontractors may submit proprietary information and cost or pricing data directly to the Government no later than the date and time specified in the instructions for receipt of offers for this RFP.

Page 91 of 126

d. Identify, explain, and reconcile any differences between your cost proposal budget line items and/or rates and those budget line items and/or rates in your established accounting system. This establishes an audit trail from your proposal to your books and records. e. The Offeror must submit a detailed budget, per component, and budget narrative that supports item for item the cost estimates proposed in its detailed budget. The budget narrative must describe the nature of individual cost items proposed calculations and include a description of the source of that particular cost estimate (current market value, current catalogue price, current vendor price quotes, etc.). Narratives for the individual cost items must provide a discussion of any estimated escalation rates where applicable. Estimated costs proposed to exceed ceilings imposed by USAID or Federal procurement policy must be fully explained and justified. i. Salary and Wages: Direct salaries and wages should be proposed in accordance with the following: (A) For All Long-Term Professional Positions: a) The Offeror's certified Salary Range (see Section H.7), which must include the responsibilities associated with the position, along with the minimum requirements sought for that position; and b) The selected candidate's salary history as certified in the Biographical Data Sheets (see EXHIBIT 2 or the electronic forms that may be obtained at http://www.usaid.gov/forms), which will determine where the candidate's salary will fall within the appropriate salary range. Section H.7 also discusses salary escalations. Such escalations should bear in mind the top range of the scale for the position, as over the life of the project, the maximum salary may not exceed the maximum end of that range, unless the candidate is promoted and takes on higher responsibilities. As indicated in the budget template, the offeror must separate expatriate and cooperating country national labor categories for all staff. (B) For All Other Long-Term Positions: The salaries and wages proposed must be in line with the market value of such positions and commensurate with the responsibilities of the position. (C) For Short-Term Technical Assistance (Consultants): The Offeror must submit a Pay Scale for these positions, which will include the level of expertise (e.g., Junior, Mid-Level, Senior), along with the responsibilities and the qualifications sought for each level. ii. Fringe Benefits: If the Offeror has a fringe benefit rate that has been approved by an agency of the Government, such rate must be used and evidence of its approval must be provided. If a fringe benefit rate has not been so approved, the application must propose a rate and explain how the rate was determined. If the latter is used, the narrative must include a detailed breakdown comprised of all items of fringe benefits (e.g., unemployment insurance, workers compensation, health and life insurance, retirement, FICA, etc.) and the costs of each, expressed in dollars and as a percentage of salaries. iii. Travel, Transportation, and Per Diem: The proposal must indicate the number of trips, domestic and international, and the estimated costs per trip. Specify the origin and destination for each proposed trip, duration of travel, and number of individuals Page 92 of 126

traveling. Per Diem must be based on the Offeror's normal travel policies (Offerors may choose to refer to the Federal Standardized Travel Regulations for cost estimates). Offeror's must review all regulations related to Business Class Travel for Contractor's Employees and base cost/business proposals on current regulations. iv. Procurement: The Offeror must submit a list of proposed non-expendable property purchases. Specify all equipment to be purchased, including the type of equipment, the manufacturer, the unit cost, the number of units to be purchased and the expected geographic source. Goods and services provided by the Offerors under this USAID-financed award are subject to the 937 Geographic Code. v. Equipment and Supplies: Specify all other equipment, materials and supplies expected to be purchased, including type, unit cost, and units. vi. Communications: Specific information regarding the type of communication cost at issue (i.e. mail, telephone, cellular phones, internet etc.) must be included in order to allow an assessment of the realism and reasonableness of these costs. vii. Subcontracts (to include Security/Life Support, per paragraph (ix.) below): Information sufficient to determine the reasonableness of the cost/price of each specific subcontract and consultant expected to be hired must be included. Also be sure to include the rationale for the type of subcontract chosen. USAID highly encourages firm fixed price contracts wherever possible, or other types as appropriate in order to ensure maximum incentive for control of costs and performance based on deliverables. Time and Material, or Labor Hour contracts will not be consented to. viii. Allowances: Allowances must be broken down by specific type and by person. Allowances must be in accordance with the Offeror's policies and the applicable regulations and policies established by the U.S. Department of State. ix. Security: USAID encourages offerors to seek out turnkey or end-to-end solutions for their security and/or life support needs. Such solutions may include: provision of armored vehicles, labor for guard forces, barricades, security equipment, as well as other miscellaneous cost which directly benefit the program, often including life support. See (13) below for additional information regarding adequate security costs documentation. x. Environmental: The Offerors must take environmental considerations and significant environmental impacts of the proposed activities into account and assure that appropriate environmental safeguards are adopted for all activities. If applicable, Cost/business proposals must reflect sound environmental management as an integral part of all activities to be implemented. Environmental considerations are an integral part of the activities and shall not be considered as an additional component. xi. Office Rent: Specific information regarding the cost of any facilities needed to perform program activities. The information provided must identify the location, the unit cost (rent), the time period the facilities are needed and the number of facilities. Only facilities that directly benefit the program activities must be included in this category; all other facility costs must be included in the indirect cost category. Page 93 of 126

xii. Other Direct Costs: This includes report preparation costs, passports and visas fees, medical exams and inoculations, insurance (other than insurance included in the Offeror's fringe benefits), as well as any other miscellaneous costs, which directly benefit the program proposed by the Offeror. The narrative must provide a breakdown and support for all other direct costs. For seminars, workshops and conferences, the Offeror must indicate the subject, venue and duration of proposed conferences and seminars, their relationship to the program objectives, along with estimates of costs. Also, offerors shall reflect costs for environmental compliance implementation and monitoring. xiii. Indirect Costs: The Offeror must support the proposed indirect cost rate with a letter from a cognizant U.S. Government audit agency or with sufficient information for USAID to determine the reasonableness of the rates. (For example, a breakdown of labor bases and overhead pools, the method of determining the rate, a description of all costs in the pools, etc.) The Offeror must propose indirect cost ceilings. See (3) below for additional information regarding indirect cost submission requirements. xiv. Fee: The proposed fee must be justifiable and appropriate for the level of complexity and risk associated with successful performance under this contract. Factors such as the sophistication and complexity of labor mix, management burden, cost risk, etc., must be reasonably considered. The fixed fee portion associated with each CLIN must also be discussed and must be commensurate with the number and complexity of deliverables associated with each Task. Pursuant to FAR 16.306(d)(1), the entire Fixed Fee will be payable upon completion of all the deliverables specified in Section F.3, within the Total Estimated Cost. However, the Offeror can propose a Fixed Fee Schedule that will allow for incremental payments of the Fixed Fee, tied to the incremental completion of deliverables. The payment schedule must be appropriate and commensurate with the level of risk associated with each deliverable. (3) Indirect Cost Information a. The Offeror and each proposed major subcontractor shall include a complete copy of its most current Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) or other documentation from its cognizant Government Audit Agency, if any, stating the most recent final indirect cost rates. The proposal shall also include the name and address of the Government Audit Agency, and the name and telephone number of the auditor. b. If the Offeror or any major subcontractor does not have a cognizant Government Audit Agency, the proposal shall include: i. Audited balance sheets and profit and loss statements for the last two complete years, and the current year-to-date statements (or such lesser period of time if the Offeror is a newly-formed organization), must be included in the proposal. The profit and loss statements should include detail of the total cost of goods and services sold, including a listing of the various indirect administrative costs, and be supplemented by information on the prime contractor's customary indirect cost allocation method, together with supporting computations of the basis for the Page 94 of 126

indirect cost rate(s) proposed; and ii. the most recent two fiscal year pool and base cost compositions along with derived rates, the bases of allocation of these rates and an independent certified audit by a certified accounting firm of these rates. (4) Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors The Offeror and each proposed subcontractor shall complete Section K, "Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offeror", and sign and date on the last page in the space provided. (5) Policies and Procedures If the offeror does not have prior Federal contracting experience submit a copy of its personnel policies, especially regarding salary and wage scales, fringe benefits, merit increases, promotions, leave, differentials, travel and per diem regulations, etc. The Contracting Officer may determine that a Pre-Award Survey is necessary. (See FAR 9.106). (6) Subcontracting Plan If the offeror is other than a small business, it must submit a Subcontracting Plan (see Exhibit 3 in Section J). Submitted Plans must address subcontracting with small business (SB), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. (7) Joint Venture Information If two or more parties have formed a partnership or joint venture (see FAR Subpart 9.6), for the purposes of submitting a proposal under this solicitation and, if selected, would perform the contract as a single entity, they must submit, as an attachment to the Cost/Business Proposal, the Corporate Charter, By-Laws, or Joint Venture or Partnership Agreement. In addition, the teaming arrangements must be identified, company relationships must be fully disclosed and respective responsibilities and method of work must be expressly stipulated. The joint venture or partnership agreement must include a full discussion of the relationship between the organizations, including identification of the organization, which will have responsibility for negotiation of Subawards under the resultant contract, which organization will have accounting responsibility, how work will be allocated, and profit or fee, if any, shared. In addition, the principles to the joint venture or partnership agreement must agree to be jointly and severally liable for the acts or omissions of the other. (8) Evidence of Responsibility The offeror must submit sufficient evidence of responsibility for the contracting officer to make an affirmative determination of responsibility pursuant to the requirements of FAR Subsection 9.104-1. If the offeror fails to submit sufficient evidence for the contracting officer to make an affirmative determination of responsibility, then the contracting officer may make a determination of non-responsibility and be precluded from awarding a Page 95 of 126

contract to that offeror. However, in the case of a small business offeror, the contracting officer will comply with FAR 19.6. Accordingly, prime offerors shall seriously address each element of responsibility. To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must: a. Have adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them (see FAR 9.104-3(a)); b. Be able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule, taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental commitments; c. Have a satisfactory performance record (See FAR 9.104-3(b) and Subpart 42.15).

Have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics; e. Have the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them (including, as appropriate, such elements as production control procedures, property control systems, quality assurance measures, and safety programs applicable to materials to be produced or services to be performed by the prospective contractor and subcontractors). (See FAR 9.104-3(a)); f. Have the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities, or the ability to obtain them (See FAR 9.104-3(a)); and

g. Be otherwise qualified and eligible to receive an award under applicable laws and regulations (e.g., Equal Opportunity, Clean Air and Water, Small Business Subcontracting, etc.). (9) Letters of Commitment (Subcontractors) The Cost/Business Proposal must include a letter, on subcontractor letterhead, and signed by an authorized representative of each major subcontractor, which specifically indicates the subcontractor's agreement to be included in the offeror's proposed teaming arrangement. (10) Biographical Data Sheets and Individual Letters of Commitment

The offeror must submit completed Contractor Employee Biographical Data Sheets (See Section J of this solicitation) for each long-term individual (other than clerical/secretarial) whose salary will be charged as a direct cost to the contract. The offeror will propose which positions/individuals are considered key/essential to the work to be performed. The form must be signed by the individual and the Offeror (or subcontractor) in the appropriate spaces with all blocks completed. Consulting fees must clearly specify the number of days for each consultancy. If the individual is on an appointment of less than 12 months (e.g., an academic year appointment for a university faculty member), the form must indicate the number of months in the appointment period. Use of Biographical Data Sheets which are more than three months old is not acceptable. Biographical Data Sheets must be presented in alphabetical order, by the Page 96 of 126

individual's surname, regardless of whether the individual is to be furnished by the prime contractor or a subcontractor. If the form reflects only the highest salary of the most recent employer, the date when such salary went into effect must be indicated. If continuation sheets are used, each must contain the individual's name, signature, and date. A SIGNED letter of commitment is required from each long-term individual indicating his/her: (a) availability to serve in the stated position, in terms of days after award; and (b) intention to serve for a stated term of the service. The letter of commitment must specify the length of commitment to the position. (11) Information to Support Consent to Major Subcontractors The offeror must address each of the elements in FAR 44.202-2 in order for proposed subcontractors to be considered by the contracting officer for consent of subcontractors to be granted with the initial award. a. Information Concerning Work-Day, Work-Week, and Paid AbsencesThe offeror and each proposed major subcontractor shall indicate the number of hours and days in its normal work-day and its normal work-week, both domestically and overseas, for employees and consultants. In addition, the offeror and each proposed major subcontractor shall- indicate how paid absences (US holidays, local holidays, vacation and sick) shall be covered. b. A normal, work-year, including paid absences (holidays, vacations, and sick leave) is 2,080 hours (260 days x 8 hours per day). However, some organizations do not have an 8-hour workday, and some accounting systems normally provide for direct recovery of paid absences by using a work-year of less than 2,080 hours to compute individuals' unburdened daily rates. The offeror and major subcontractors shall describe their core day and work week policies. c. The work day and work week policies and the method of accounting for paid absences for the offeror and major subcontractors will be incorporated into the contract in Section B. (12) Adequate Security Costs Documentation Offeror must detail all proposed security costs elements, in order to allow the Contracting Officer perform a cost realism analysis of proposed security costs. Security costs documentation must be presented in a consistent format to allow the conduction of meaningful comparison and cost realism analysis. The CO will consult with the Regional Security Office (RSO), when reviewing the reasonableness of proposed security costs. The following are some examples of possible security cost breakout elements: - Personal Security Detail; - Security and Security ­ Related Communications Equipment; - Security Training; - Static Guard Services; - Fully Armored Vehicles and/or Light Armored Vehicles, (If properly authorized and in accordance with ADS 563); - Personal Protection Equipment such as helmets, flak jackets; and/or - Security Modifications to Residential and Office Facilities, including but not limited to protective barriers, e.g. blast walls.

GENERAL INFORMATION The Government may award a contract without discussions with offerors in accordance with FAR 52.215-1. The Government intends to evaluate offerors in accordance with Section M.3 of this RFP and make contract award to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value to the U.S. Government. "Best value" is defined as the offer that results in the most advantageous solution for the Government, in consideration of technical, cost, and other factors. The submitted technical information will be scored by a technical evaluation committee using the technical criteria shown below. The evaluation committee may include industry experts who are not employees of the Federal Government. When evaluating the competing offerors, the Government will consider the written qualifications/capability information provided by the offerors, and any other information obtained by the Government through its own research. In accordance with FAR 15.304(e)(1), all evaluation factors other than cost/price when combined are significantly more important than cost/price factors. EVALUATION FACTORS

M.3

Technical proposals will be evaluated by a technical evaluation committee using the factors shown in this Section. The factors below are presented by major category in descending order of importance, so that the Offerors know which areas require emphasis in the preparation of the proposals. Based on the assessment of the technical qualities of the proposals and the evaluation of cost as described in Section M.4 below, a competitive range may be established. The factors below reflect the requirements of this particular solicitation. Offerors should note that these factors serve both: a) as the standard against which each Technical Proposals will be evaluated; and b) to identify significant matters which the Offeror should address in their proposals.

Page 99 of 126

FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL APPROACH The sub-factors below are listed in descending order of importance: (1) The extent to which the Offeror provides a clear, logical, technically sound, and feasible approach that reflects an expert understanding of USAID/Colombia's country and regional programmatic context and priorities; an innovative methodology that addresses the SOW objective in an integrated fashion and in a manner that ensures sustainability; employs innovative approaches and methodologies; reflects participation of local expertise, partners and stakeholders; reflects integration of gender considerations throughout; and demonstrates expertise on the design of innovative methodologies for large scale evaluations, such as that required for the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI); (2) The extent to which the Offeror's methodology incorporates and reflects an expert understanding of USAID's Evaluation Policy, Gender Equality and Female Empowerment policy, as well as USAID's policy on programming, assessing and learning (Automated Directives System (ADS) 200 series); and clearly links the criteria to be used for the various deliverables outlined in Section C, to these USAID principles and policy elements; and (3) The extent to which the Offeror proposes a clearly organized, comprehensive and appropriate Performance Monitoring Plan that reflects a robust approach for collecting, analyzing, tracking and reporting data for all the work envisioned in Section C. FACTOR 2: PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND KEY PERSONNEL The sub-criteria below are listed in descending order of importance, with sub-criteria (1) and (2) of equal importance: (1) The extent to which the staff proposed demonstrates the breadth and depth of international and local professional technical expertise and experience required to implement this project and Key Personnel proposed meets the minimum qualifications identified in Section C. Demonstrated capacity to field a wide range of expertise, particularly local, in the technical areas that are key to the project success; (2) The extent to which the offeror's institutional experience, staffing and partnership arrangements demonstrate expertise and commitment towards achieving the contract objectives, and to developing sustainable local capabilities; and the extent to which the proposed management plan supports directly and clearly the successful implementation of the program; and (3) The extent which the initial work plan clearly demonstrates responsiveness to the requirements, capacity to mobilize and utilize resources rapidly, effectively, efficiently and in a way that will yield immediate and visible program results. FACTOR 3: INSTITUTIONAL PAST PERFORMANCE Performance information will be used for both the responsibility determination and best value decision. USAID may use performance information obtained from other than the sources identified by the offeror/subcontractor. USAID will utilize existing databases of Contractor Page 100 of 126

performance information and solicit additional information from the references provided in accordance with Section L of this RFP and from other sources if and when the Contracting Officer finds the existing databases to be insufficient for evaluating an offeror's performance. If the performance information contains negative information on which the offeror has not previously been given an opportunity to comment, USAID will provide the offeror an opportunity to comment on it prior to its consideration in the evaluation, and any offeror comment will be considered with the negative performance information. USAID will initially determine the relevance of similar performance information as a predictor of probable performance under the subject requirement. USAID may give more weight to performance information that is considered more relevant and/or more current. In cases where (i) an offeror lacks relevant performance history, (ii) information on performance is not available, or (iii) an offeror is a member of a class of offerors where there is provision not to rate the class against a sub factor, then the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on performance. An exception to this neutral rating provision: the non-small businesses prime with no history of subcontracting with small business concerns. Prior to assigning a "neutral" past performance rating, the Contracting Officer may take into account a broad range of information related to an offeror's performance. USAID will evaluate each Offerer's experience and the experience of each major subcontractor (expected to provide at least 20 percent of the total labor) on the basis of its reputation with its former and current customers and others on the following, at a minimum: ˇ Experience to undertake work similar to that described in the statement of work. Experience in managing complex projects and responding to different client groups, including evidence of successful collaboration. ˇ Experience in conducting complex evaluations and assessments, using of state-of-the-art innovative and creative methodologies, including multi-sectoral evaluations in developing countries. ˇ Experience in using local personnel and organizations in conducting evaluations and assessments in developing countries. ˇ Experiencing in assembling high quality technical assistance teams, placing them in the field in a timely manner and providing them with all necessary support. This ability should be evidenced by organizational commitment and organizational systems designed to utilize local consortium members as appropriate. ˇ Demonstrated ability to build and maintain relationships with host country counterparts and collaborate with USAID and other donors. M.4 COST PROPOSAL EVALUATIONS USAID will also evaluate the proposed costs to determine if they are fair and reasonable using proposal analysis techniques consistent with FAR 15.404. Each cost proposal will be evaluated but will not be assigned a rating. The evaluation of cost will include a determination of cost realism, completeness, and reasonableness. An analysis of the proposed cost will be conducted to determine the validity and the extent to which it reflects performance addressed in the technical proposal. An assessment will be made of the offeror's capability to accomplish the Page 101 of 126

contract objectives within the estimated cost proposed. The cost proposal will be used as an aid to determine the offeror's understanding of Technical Requirements. Cost Realism: Cost realism is the degree to which all costs for the total contract reflect the proposed approach to achieving the technical objectives. Proposals requiring significant adjustments to arrive at probable cost may be construed to lack understanding of the technical requirements and may have their technical score reduced accordingly. M.5 SOURCE SELECTION (a) The overall evaluation methodology set forth above will be used by the Contracting Officer as a guide in determining which proposal(s) offer the best value to the U.S. Government. In accordance with FAR 52.215-1, and as set forth in Section L of this solicitation, award will be made by the Contracting Officer to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value to the U.S. Government after evaluation in accordance with all factors in the solicitation. This procurement utilizes the tradeoff process set forth in FAR 15.101-1. If the Contracting Officer determines that competing Technical Proposals are essentially equal, cost/price factors may become the determining factor in source selection. Conversely, if the Contracting Officer determines that competing cost/price proposals are essentially equal, technical factors may become the determining factor in source selection. Further the Contracting Officer may award to a higher priced Offeror if a determination is made that the higher technical evaluation of that Offeror merits the additional cost/price.

(b)

M.6 DETERMINATION OF COMPETITIVE RANGE (a) The competitive range of Offerors with whom negotiations will be conducted (if necessary) will be determined by the Contracting Officer pursuant to FAR 15.306(c) (1). A competitive range determination (if necessary) may take place at any point in the evaluation process. Offerors are advised that, in accordance with FAR 52.215-1, if the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

* Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), paragraph 19.708(b) prescribes the use of the clause at FAR 52.219-9 entitled "Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, and Women Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan." The following is a suggested model for use when formulating such subcontracting plan. While this model plan has been designed to be consistent with FAR 52.219-9, other formats of a subcontracting plan may be acceptable. However, failure to include the essential information as exemplified in this model may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or offer where the clause is applicable. Further, the use of this model is not intended to waive other requirements that may be applicable under FAR 52.219-9. "SUBCONTRACT" as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract. 1.

Goals, expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars, for the use of small business, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns meet the definition of veteran-owned small business concerns, and offerors may include them within the subcontracting plan goal for veteran-owned small business concerns. A separate goal for service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns is not required. The offeror shall include all subcontracts that contribute to contract performance, and may include a proportionate share of products and services that are normally allocated as indirect costs. A statement of ­ Total dollars planned to be subcontracted for an individual contract plan; or the offeror's total projected sales, expressed in dollars, and the total value of projected subcontracts to support the sales for a commercial plan is: $_______________ and _______________% (ii) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small business concerns is: $_______________ and _______________%* Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to veteran-owned small business concerns is: $_______________ and _______________%* Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns is: $_______________ and_______________%* Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to HUBZone small business concerns is: $_______________ and _______________%* Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to small disadvantaged business concerns is: $_______________ and _______________%* Total dollars planned to be subcontracted to women-owned small business concerns is: $_______________ and _______________%*
