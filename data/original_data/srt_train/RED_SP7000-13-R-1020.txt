52.233-9000 Agency protests (DLAD) (Nov 2011)

Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the contracting officer, 2) with the Government Accountability Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protects filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979". (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the contracting officer; this process is not an appellate review of a contracting officer's decision on a

(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute. (b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.2331), or, for the Agency, by the contracting officer, and approved at a level above the contracting officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the contracting officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate. (c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here [ ]. Alternate wording may be negotiated with the contracting officer.

INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS PRICE RELATED FACTORS. As part of its offered price, the contractor will offer: 1.0 FIRM FIXED PRICE FOR THE ONE-TIME PURCHASE OF COPIERS/DEVICES

The Government requires Firm-Fixed Price offers for supplies (Copiers) sought under CLIN's 0014 and 0015. The Government will retain ownership upon successful delivery, acceptance, and payment. Maintenance/service support will be procured under CLIN's 0016 through 0020. 2.0 FLAT RATE MONTHLY FEE COPYING PLAN

The Government requires Firm-Fixed Price offers that provide Flat Rate Prices for supplies and services sought under CLIN's 0001through 0013(Copier lease/rental) and CLIN's 0016 through 0020 (Equipment maintenance agreement). The term "Flat Rate Prices" means one monthly price for each Volume Band or Item throughout all months of the contract. An example of "Flat Rate Prices" is an offer of $100.00 per month for each Volume Band 1A piece of equipment for all months of the contact. This $100.00 price per month does not change throughout the contract period. Additionally, if the Government exercises its options to increase quantity or fund subsequent fiscal years, the price per additional piece of Volume Band 1A equipment will be $100.00 per month throughout the contract period. DLA Document Services intends to enter into a Flat Rate Monthly Fee Copying Plan or Operating Lease for supplies and services sought under CLIN's 0001through 0013(Copier lease/rental) and CLIN's 0016 through 0020 (Equipment maintenance agreement). Ownership of equipment leased under CLIN's 0001through 0013(Copier lease/rental) shall not transfer to the government at any time, including at the end of the order. 3.0 TERMINATION CEILING CHARGES

DLA Document Services seeks to avoid termination ceiling charges for removed or cancelled equipment when there is no longer a bona fide need for the equipment or for functionally similar equipment due to the end user's official reorganization; downsizing; or if the decision is outside the end user's control because the end user has been mobilized and no longer occupies the facility. A delivery order issued as a result of this Request for Proposal may be terminated at any time during a Government fiscal year by the Ordering Agency's Contracting Office responsible for the delivery order in accordance with FAR 52.212-4, paragraph (l) Termination for the Government's Convenience. Therefore, as part of their proposal, vendors may submit a Termination Ceiling Charge (TCC). The TCC is a limit on the amount that a contractor may claim from the Ordering Agency on the termination for convenience of a lease or failure to renew a lease prior to the end of the lease term for reasons other than those set forth in the contract pertaining to Termination for Non-Appropriation. If a termination for convenience is required by DLA Document Services, the procedures and guidance set forth at FAR 52.212-4(l) will be adhered to. Any quote or offer that attempts to bind the government to an agreed upon allowable termination charge (other than a ceiling or limit) will be considered unacceptable and will not be considered for award. When formulating TCC's, only the value of the equipment should be included. TCC's which include the cost for maintenance, training, consumable supplies, etc. will not be valid. PROPOSAL FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL 1.0 Proposal Format:

Each proposal shall consist of three (3) separate documents specifically named: "Part 1. Technical Requirements," "Part 2. Past Performance" and "Part 3. Prices". The contents of each part are set forth below. No price information will be included in Parts 1 and/or 2. Offers will be evaluated as set forth below in "Evaluation Factors for Award". Part 1. Technical Requirements: In Part 1, the offeror must demonstrate compliance with ALL the Technical Requirements set forth in Attachment 1 Performance Work Statement (PWS). No price information shall be included in Part 1. Part 2. Past Performance:

Page 41 of 42

In Part 2 the offeror must submit no less than two (2) and no more than three (3) customer references for work performed that is relevant and similar in scope to this requirement. Include reference names, telephone numbers, email addresses and a brief description of the work performed. No price information will be included in Part 2. Part 3. Price: In Part 3 the offeror must submit a single monthly price for each Volume Band listed in Section B in the space provided for the unit price. In addition the offeror must provide an extended price for each Volume Band (e.g., Amount shown in the QTY (quantity) X U/P (unit price) = Total). The offeror must then add all the extended prices for a grand total proposal. Price offers must reflect Firm Fixed Pricing. DLA DOCUMENT SERVICES seeks to avoid termination ceiling charges.

A second award will be issued for the lease/rental of copiers listed under CLIN's 0001 through 0013 and maintenance support listed under CLINS 0016 through 0020. A. Technical Factors To be technically acceptable each offeror must demonstrate it meets all the Technical Factors (including all sub-factors) set forth in the attached Performance Work Statement. This will be evaluated as "pass" or "fail" basis. In order to receive a "pass" rating the proposal must clearly demonstrate the ability to provide and perform all services and technical requirements described in the Performance Work Statement. A proposal that is evaluated as "fail" for any requirement will not be considered for award.

B. Past Performance A past performance review will be conducted to determine whether the Government has confidence that the offeror can successfully perform the requirements set forth in the Performance Work Statement. In conducting its past performance assessment the Government may use both data provided by the offeror and data obtained from other federal Government sources. Past performance will be determined on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. C. Price To ensure fair price analysis, each offeror's price for price analysis purposes will be determined by taking its grand total proposal for base period, all option periods and for options for increased quantity. (See Part 3, Price under Format and Submittal above)
