2.0.  Order Title.  Computer Network Defense (CND) Sensor System Support

3.0.  Background.  As manager of the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII), the Defense Information Systems Agency is charged with securing
the adequate protection of the DII against information attacks and Information Warfare (IW).  The DII extends from the national level, through
the commanders of the Combatant Commands, through the Combatant Commands’ sub-unified commands, joint task forces, component commands, and
supporting organizations and agencies to individuals. Fulfilling this responsibility includes developing an integrated DoD-wide protection and
operational restoration capability to counter security threats to, incidents within, and attacks on DoD information technology.  Part of this
development necessarily includes advising and providing support to users and operators of the DII.  This advice and  support will include
providing technical implementation of Information Assurance (IA) tools and vulnerability resolution support at DISA and DISA customer sites.

3.1.  Authority.  The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASDC3I), directed the establishment
of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information System Security (INFOSEC) Task Force.  One recommendation from this task force was
to institutionalize the required security control process via the DISA Field Security Operations (FSO), FS, at Letterkenny Army Depot,
Chambersburg, PA.  The restrictions of budget and personnel available within DoD preclude accomplishment of subject effort completely "in-
house."  Contractor information assurance (IA) technical support is necessary to supplement Government efforts to reduce security risks to DISA
information systems and the communications infrastructure.

4.0.  Objectives. Provide intrusion detection sensor and IA Range technical support for DISA customers to include, but not be limited to, the
Combatant Command locations, DISA and other Federal Government agencies to obtain and maintain accreditation, and continuously enhance overall
site security.

12.0. Security Requirements.  This section shall be considered a supplement to block 13 of the Government provided DD 254, Contract
Classification Specification.  The following security requirements shall apply to this effort.

12.1. Facility Security Clearance.  The work to be performed under this contract is up to and including the Top Secret level and may require
Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access eligibility.  Therefore the company must have a final Top Secret Facility Clearance Level (FCL)
from the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO).

12.2.       Security Clearance and Information Technology (IT) Level.   All personnel performing on this contract will be U.S. citizens.  There
are two levels of personnel security requirements under this contract:

12.2.1.     All system information assurance (IA) technical support positions and traditional security professional positions require a minimum
of interim Top Secret security clearance and interim IT-I (privileged level systems access) eligibility when performance starts.  Additionally,
all contractor personnel performing work at Combatant Commands and their sub-unified commands, joint task forces, component commands, and
supporting organizations and agencies will require a final Top Secret clearance and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access eligibility
adjudicated by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) to perform their duties on this TO.  SCI Processing for SCI eligibility will be coordinated
with the supporting Government Security Manager (DISA Field Security Operations) and will begin immediately upon start of duty performance under
this contract.

12.2.1.1. Personnel requiring Top Secret security clearance and/or  IT-I eligibility may be considered for a waiver to hire on a case-by-case
basis, if they do not currently posses their required clearance and/or investigation.  Requests for waivers are to be submitted to the Task
Monitor, in writing.  Waivers will only be considered if:

12.2.1.1.1. The individual has been granted at least an Interim Secret clearance and no known derogatory information exists, based on review of
the individual’s SF 86, by the contractor Facility Security Officer (FSO).

 12.2.1.1.2. There is sufficient work to be done at the lower level. An oversight plan will be submitted to the TM for approval and any
privileged access will be actively supervised by an IT-1 vetted individual.

12.2.1.1.3. Continued performance on this contract is contingent upon receipt of final required clearance and/IT position eligibility.

12.2.2.     Administrative and Support positions such as  Editor/Analysts, Administrative Assistants, and VMS Trainers and Developers not
performing in roles listed above, shall have a minimum interim Secret security clearance and interim IT-II (user level systems access)
eligibility when performance starts. All work performed by a developer holding a sensitivity designation of IT-II must have their work reviewed
by someone holding a sensitivity designation of IT-I.  No more than three developers supporting the Enterprise Vulnerability Management System
(paragraph 6.7) can occupy IT-II positions.

12.3.       Investigation Requirements.  There are two levels of personnel security investigation requirements under this contract:

12.3.1.     Personnel performing IA technical support duties and traditional security professional duties under this contract must undergo a
favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) as a minimum investigation.  The SSBI will be maintained current within 5-
years and requests for Special Background Periodic Review (SBPR) will be initiated 6-months prior to the 5-year anniversary date of the previous
SSBI or SBPR.

12.3.2.     Personnel performing administrative and other support duties under this contract must undergo a favorably adjudicated National
Agency Check, Local Agency Check and Credit Check (NACLC) as a minimum investigation.  The NACLC will be maintained current within 10-years and
requests for Secret Periodic Review (SPR) will be initiated 6-months prior to the 10-year anniversary date of the previous NACLC or SPR.

12.4. Adjudication for IT Access.  Adjudication for IT access is not required if the individual has been granted a interim or final Secret or
Top Secret clearance by any of the Department of Defense adjudication facilities (WHS/CAF, DISCO, DIA, ACCF, AFCAF, NAVCAF) at the equivalent
levels:

      Final Top Secret:            Final IT-I Eligibility
      Final Secret:          Final IT-II Eligibility
      Interim Top Secret:    Interim IT-I Eligibility
      Interim Secret:        Interim IT-II Eligibility

12.5.       Interim IT-I Access.  Interim IT-I adjudication may be request from DISA, through DISA FSO.  Alternatively a Request for Waiver may
be submitted to perform duty at the IT-II level.

12.5.1.     Following are the requirements, which must be met prior to requesting  interim IT-I authorization:

The request for SSBI must be submitted by the contractor Facility Security Officer (FSO) to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office
(DISCO).  A copy of all completed forms used to request the investigation (E-QIP or word fillable SF 86) must be submitted to the DISA Field
Security Operations Security Manager (SM).  The SM will forward the forms along with a written request for interim IT-I authorization to DISA
Personnel Security for approval.

The National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the SSBI or a previous valid NCLC/DNACI/NAC or ENTNAC must be completed and favorably adjudicated
before interim IT-I access will be granted. Advance notice of NAC results or a request for interim Top Secret clearance should be requested by
the contractor FSO for those contractor employees without a previous investigation.

12.6.       Visit Authorization Letters.  The Contractor will forward a Visit Authorization Letter (VAL) to the following  Contracting Officer’s
Representative/Task Monitor for all employees prior to the beginning of each contracting/contract period of performance and as new contractor
employees are assigned to the contract:

12.7. Information Security and other miscellaneous requirements.

12.7.1.     Contractor personnel must comply with local security requirements for entry and exit control for personnel and property at the
Government facility.

12.7.2.     Contractor employees will be required to comply with all Government security regulations and requirements.  Initial and periodic
security training and briefings will be provided by Government security personnel. Failure to comply with security requirements can be cause for
termination of employment.

12.7.3.     The Contractor shall not divulge any information about DoD files, data processing activities or functions, user identifications,
passwords, or any other knowledge that may be gained, to anyone who is not authorized to have access to such information.  The Contractor shall
observe and comply with the security provisions in effect at the DoD facility. Identification shall be worn and displayed as required.

12.7.4.     DISA retains the right to request removal of contractor personnel regardless of prior clearance or adjudication status, whose
actions, while assigned to this contract, clearly conflict with the interest of the Government.

12.7.5.     Contractor personnel will generate or handle documents that contain FOUO information, at both Government and contractor facilities.
Storage of any Government classified information or materials at the contractor’s facility under this contract are not authorized, unless
specific exception is granted by the Government Task Monitor.  Any exception for the contractor to store classified will require the
contractor’s facility to be approved for classified storage by the Defense Security Service (DSS) and appropriate modification of the DD 254.
Contractor shall have access to, generate, and handle classified material at Government and contractor facilities.  All contractor deliverables
shall be marked at a minimum FOUO, unless otherwise directed by the Government.  The contractor shall comply with the provisions of the DoD
Industrial Security Manual for handling classified material and producing deliverables. The contractor shall comply with DISA Instruction 630-
230-19.

12.7.6.     Sensitive Data Stored at Contractor Facilities.  The contractor shall ensure that FSO and customer data stored at contractor
facilities is protected in compliance with the FSO Security Standard Operating Procedures and the National Industrial Security Program Operating
Manual (NISPOM).

13. 0.      Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE)/Government-Furnished Information (GFI).
The Government will provide access (at a Government location) to the ADP, computer and support equipment necessary for the contractor to access
and perform work on the SIPRNET, including computer hardware and software, from the time of contract award through the period of performance.
SIPRNET user accounts will be provided to the contractor for the duration of the task.

To support property accountability within FSO, the contractor shall delegate a property custodian and an alternate property custodian to manage
GFE assigned to their workforce.  The property custodian will be responsible for providing supporting with annual inventory efforts as well as
accessing the Defense Property Accountability System (DPAS) throughout the year to maintain property records within their assigned
responsibility.  Property custodian responsibilities will be part-time duties, typically requiring little time when equipment is being
assigned/reassigned to more time during inventory cycles.  The property custodian and alternate property custodians will also sign the
designated hand receipt and be responsible for all accountable property within their assigned area of responsibility, as well as generating sub-
hand receipts to individual users.  Property custodians will be required to complete training in order to be granted access to DPAS, as they
will also have signature authority for receiving/moving property and making those changes in DPAS.

GFE and contractor-acquired Government owned equipment will be used for this PWS under this delivery order.  Any hardware or software procured
under DISA's approval for this contract shall remain property of the Government, and shall be returned to the Government as specified by the TM
at the conclusion of the contract.  The TM will provide a detailed list.  Individuals possessing GFE will follow DISA property accountability
processes and procedures.


14.0. Other Pertinent Information or Special Considerations.

 Identification of Possible Additional Workload.
The program office anticipates that additional within-scope work will be identified as this contract progresses and the need for these services
expand.    As more and more DoD customers recognize the need for these services, additional contractor support will be required.  It is
anticipated that additional level of effort might be identified throughout the period of performance, and added to the TO through exercise of
additional optional tasks.  Each exercised optional task can have a combination of contractor’s proposed labor categories and hours for the
scope of the work, and associated travel.


      Optional Task 1:  Computer Network Defense (CND) System Support
      Optional Task 2:  Securify SecurVantage Implementation Support.
      Optional Task 3:  IA Range Support

Identification of Potential Conflicts of Interest (COI).  There are neither existing nor potential COIs on this Contract.

Identification of Non-Disclosure Requirements.  All contractor personnel working on this effort must execute nondisclosure agreements prior to
commencement of their starting work on this effort.  (This includes access to the FSO Technical Library before contract award, for proposal
preparation).  For the purposes of this TO, all related customer information is classified no lower than Unclassified Controlled Information
(Comply with the appropriate contract paragraph).

Packaging, Packing and Shipping Instructions.  All packaging, packing and shipping requirements shall be in accordance with the Small Business
set-aside contract.

 Inspection and Acceptance Criteria.  All inspection and acceptance requirements shall be in accordance with the basic contract.  In addition,
the contractor shall comply with the following criteria.

      (1) Acceptance Criteria.  Unless otherwise noted, the Government shall have fifteen (15) working days to         review and comment on
deliverables.  The Government may accept a deliverable, accept a deliverable   subject to the incorporation of comments, or reject a
deliverable.  Draft deliverables that are acceptable are      normally accepted subject to incorporation of the comments into the final version.
 A draft deliverable may     meet the criteria of accuracy, functionality, completeness, professional quality and overall compliance, but    the
assumptions, outside circumstances or Government guidance upon which the draft document was     developed may have changed.  In these
circumstances one or more subsequent versions of the draft    document may be required and the contractor shall develop subsequent versions of
drafts based on  Government direction if the Government requires additional drafts prior to the final version.  Government  comments on
documents that are rejected will be sufficiently specific with respect to the deficiencies in the     criteria of accuracy, functionality,
completeness, professional quality and overall compliance so that it      clearly states what actions are required to bring the deliverable into
compliance.

      (2)   Rejection Procedures.   After notification that a deliverable did not meet the acceptance criteria, the    contractor shall return
updated/corrected versions fifteen (15) workdays after receipt of Government   comments.  Upon resubmission, the acceptance criteria set forth
in the paragraph above will apply.  Any      deficiencies then identified will be resolved after discussions between the contractor and the
Government.      (Provide any specific requirements.)

52.204-9001 Contract/Order Closeout—Fixed-Price, Time-and-Materials, or Labor-Hours (Jan 2007)

Timely contract closeout is a priority under this contract/order.  The Contractor shall submit a final invoice within ninety (90) calendar days
after the expiration of this contract/order, unless the Contractor requests and is granted an extension by the Contracting Officer, in writing.
In addition, and concurrent with the submission of the final invoice, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of the amount of
excess funds that can be deobligated from this contract/order so the closeout process can begin as soon as possible upon expiration of this
contract/order.  A bilateral contract/order closeout modification will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Contracting Officer and must be
signed by the Contractor and returned to the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of issuance of the modification.  A
Contractor’s failure to respond and/or sign the bilateral closeout modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt will constitute
approval of the terms of the modification and the modification will subsequently be processed unilaterally by the Contracting Officer to
deobligate excess funds and close this contract/order.

If this contract/order contains option periods, the Contractor is required to submit an invoice within ninety (90) calendar days after
expiration of the base period of performance and the expiration of each exercised option period of performance to allow for deobligation of
excess funds that were obligated in those respective periods of performance.

52.219-28    POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (APR 2009)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that
exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the
clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of
operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size
standard in paragraph (c) of this clause. Such a concern is ``not dominant in its field of operation'' when it does not exercise a controlling
or major influence on a national basis in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns are primarily engaged. In
determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of
employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements,
facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.

(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its
size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the
following:

(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the
novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to
include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts--

(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that
corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard
corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a
construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause

and property that could not be returned to a supplier under paragraph (j)(2)(i)(C) of this clause.

(3) Inventory disposal schedules. (i) The Contractor shall use Standard Form 1428, Inventory Disposal Schedule, to identify--

(A) Government-furnished property that is no longer required for performance of this contract, provided the terms of another Government contract

performance of that contract; and

52.209-5     CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (DEC 2008)

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-

(A) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
Federal agency;

(B) Have (  ) have not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or
local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal
tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(C) Are (  ) are not (  ) presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of
the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision.; and

(D) Have [ballot], have not [ballot], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an
amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined
if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally
determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax
Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax
Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under
I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal
to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the
underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is
not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised
all judicial appeal rights.

(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11
U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(ii) The Offeror has (  ) has not (  ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any
Federal agency.

(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or
supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business
segment; and similar positions).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns
that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under
this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of
the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror
nonresponsible.

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the
certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.
If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the
Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(End of provision)



52.215-6      PLACE OF PERFORMANCE (OCT 1997)

(a) The offeror or respondent, in the performance of any contract resulting from this solicitation, (  ) intends, (  ) does not intend (check
applicable block) to use one or more plants or facilities located at a different address from the address of the offeror or respondent as
indicated in this proposal or response to request for information.

(b) If the offeror or respondent checks “intends” in paragraph (a) of this provision, it shall insert in the following spaces the required
information:

Place of Performance(Street Address, City, State, County, Zip Code)

Name and Address of Owner and Operator of the Plant or Facility if Other Than Offeror or Respondent

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
GENERAL:  A board of qualified personnel shall evaluate each proposal submitted in response to this Request for  Proposal (RFP).  The evaluation
of technical features includes an assessment to determine if the proposed solution satisfies the Government’s objectives and provides for high
quality performance.  The evaluation factors described below will be used to evaluate vendor proposals.

Non-Cost Factors:
Factor 1 - Technical/Management Approach
Factor 2 - Past Performance

Cost Factors:
Factor 3 – Cost/Price


Factor 1, Technical/Management Approach, is more important than Factor 2, Past Performance.

All non-cost evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than Factor 3, Cost/Price.

Factor 1 – Technical/Management Approach: The following are the subfactors for Technical/Management Approach.  The subfactors are of equal
importance.

   a. The Contractor shall demonstrate the ability to successfully perform site requirements analysis for DoD sites to include the ability to
   perform all stages of implementation; pre-deployment configuring and staging of equipment, security compliance testing, shipping of the
   equipment, and on-site installation of systems at the analyzed locations.


   b. The Contractor shall demonstrate the ability to successfully develop and maintain system baselines, to ensure that the appropriate version
   of the actual software along with any pertinent software patches are installed and operating correctly, and the ability to provide support for
   systems after installation, to include closure of SRR findings and coordination of life cycle management issues with supported sites.

Factor 2 - Past Performance: Submitted past performance information should be current within the past 3 years as of the date of release of this
solicitation.  Vendors may submit up to three past performance references with their submission.  Past Performance will be evaluated based on
scope, complexity, and size.  The nature of work performed on previous task orders is similar to the work requested.  The level of difficulty of
work performed on previous task orders is similar to the work requested.  The scale and size of the work performed in terms of dollars, users or
units is similar to the work requested.

Factor 3 - Cost/Price:  This factor will evaluate the price proposal offered by the company.  The Offeror is required to submit all pricing data
in the format indicated in Sections B and L of the  solicitation.  Offerors are required to submit their proposed costs for the entire 60 month
period.  The evaluation period commences with the date of contract award and ends 60 months later.  Contract months and evaluation months are
assumed to be the same.

The total proposed price for each offeror will be evaluated for completeness, reasonableness, and if necessary, price realism.  Cost/Price will
not be rated with a color.

    • Completeness: The Government will verify that all solicitation requirements have been priced, figures are correctly calculated, and costs
      are presented in a clear and useful format.


    • Reasonableness:  The Government will determine the reasonableness of the overall price based on adequate price competition and by
      comparison with the Government's Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).


    • Realism: The Government reserves the right to conduct a price realism analysis to determine whether an offeror's proposed prices are
      realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements and are consistent with the various elements of
      the technical proposal.


Option Years:  In order to be considered for award, the offeror must submit pricing for the base period and the four one-year option periods.
The option periods will be evaluated before award.  However, award of the option periods will be contingent upon:
   (1) a satisfactory or better review of the contractor's performance during the base period;
   (2) market research to establish the pricing as fair and reasonable at time of the award of the option;
   (3) and the Government’s determination of a continuing need for the requirement.


   Note: At the time of award, funds will only be obligated for the base period.


Evaluation of Proposals:

Color Ratings.  A color rating depicts how well the offeror’s proposal meets the evaluation standards and RFP requirements.  The non-cost
factors will receive color ratings, Cost/Price will not.  Color ratings are assessed at the subfactor level only.  Proposals will be rated on
the basis of the following color code and risk system:

|Color         |Rating                       |Description                                                                                  |
|Blue          |                             |Exceeds specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the  |
|              |Exceptional                  |government. A proposal must have one or more strengths and no deficiencies to receive a blue.|
|Green         |                             |Meets specified minimum performance or capability requirements. A proposal must have no      |
|              |Acceptable                   |deficiencies to receive a green but may have one or more strengths.                          |
|Yellow        |                             |There is doubt regarding whether an aspect of the proposal meets a specified minimum         |
|              |Marginal                     |performance or capability requirements, but any such uncertainty is correctable.             |
|Red           |                             |Fails to meet specified minimum performance or capability requirements. The proposal has one |
|              |Unacceptable                 |or more deficiencies and is not awardable.                                                   |

The performance confidence rating is assessed at the overall past performance factor level.  Offerors without a record of relevant past
performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or the offeror’s performance record is so limited that no confidence
assessment rating can be reasonable assigned will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. (FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii) & (iv)).

Under the Past Performance factor, the Performance Confidence Assessment represents the evaluation of an offeror's present and past work record
to assess the Government's confidence in the offeror's probability of successfully performing as proposed.  The Government will evaluate the
offeror's demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet user's needs, including cost and schedule.
The Past Performance Evaluation will be accomplished by reviewing aspects of an offeror's recent and relevant present and past performance,
focusing on and targeting performance which is relevant to Tech/Mgmt subfactors and the Cost factor.  Higher relevancy will be assessed for
contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed.  The Government is not
bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy.
