SECTION 4:  EVALUATION
Please indicate your satisfaction with the contractor’s performance by placing an “X” in the appropriate block using the scale provided to the
right of each question.  This scale is defined as follows:

CODE        PERFORMANCE LEVEL

O     OUTSTANDING - The contractor has demonstrated an outstanding performance level that was significantly in excess of anticipated
           achievements and is commendable as an example to others, so that it justifies adding a point to the score.  It is expected that this
           rating will be used in those rare circumstances where contractor performance clearly exceeds the performance levels described as
           “Excellent”.

E     EXCELLENT – The contractor has substantially exceeded the contract performance requirements.

G     GOOD – There are no, or very minimal issues and the contractor has met the contract requirements.

F     FAIR – Overall compliance requires minor agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

P     POOR – Overall compliance requires significant agency resources to ensure achievement of contract requirements.

U     UNSATISFACTORY – Non-conformances are jeopardizing the achievement of contract requirements, despite use of agency resources.  Recovery  is
           not likely.  If performance cannot be substantially corrected, it constitutes a significant impediment in  consideration  for  future
           awards containing similar requirements.

N           NOT APPLICABLE - Unable to provide a score.

____________________________________________________________________________________



ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:



HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month



VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or

successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service

includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or

successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the

performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)



HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther

King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor

Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A

contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in

accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)







THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:



1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does

not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,

administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because

most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate

not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per

week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.

400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations

within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not

list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey

data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds

$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For

example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties

within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer

occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,

then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the

conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage

determination.



Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer

industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer

professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees

who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:

    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including

consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional

specifications;

    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or

modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and

related to user or system design specifications;

    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer

programs related to machine operating systems; or

    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which

requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).



2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you

work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential

and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.

 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your

regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday

premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime

(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered

overtime work).





HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees

employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or

in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This

includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive

ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder

and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.

  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations

on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations

involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.



A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that

represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to

ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials

which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the

employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the

like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.

All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and

incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials

are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for

ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.



** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **



If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract

(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or

local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by

laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an

employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage

determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the

following standards as compliance:



The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an

adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual

cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made

the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to

this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining

agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary

affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning

and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in

those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"

materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do

not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial

laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms

of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,

there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.



The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the

"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,

unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A

links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.

gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at

http://wdol.gov/.



REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form

1444 (SF 1444)}



Conformance Process:



The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is

not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to

be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage

determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable

relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted

classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such

conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the

fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by

the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)

of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall

be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}

When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444

should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be

conformed.



The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:



1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed

occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).



2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order

proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each

proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage

rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the

authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized

representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the

contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees

performs any contract work.



3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report

of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent

information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage

and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,

for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).



4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or

disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or

notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process

the request.



5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.



6) The contractor informs the affected employees.



Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.



When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of

Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure

that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the

wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that

determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.

Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide

classifications listed in the wage determination.Table of Contents

Originally provided by the Social Security Administration Section 508 Program
























HHS Guide to Completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template



Purpose:



This document provides Vendors with instructions on completing the Section 508 Evaluation Template for the US Department of Health and Human Services





Background:



In 2001, the Information Technology Industry Council partnered with the General Services Administration to create a tool that would assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements specified in Section 508.  The result of their collaboration was the 508 Evaluation Template – a simple, web-based checklist that allows Vendors to document how their product did or did not meet the various Section 508 Requirements.





How the Section 508 Evaluation Template is organized:



This template is also known as the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) 



The Section 508 Evaluation Template consists of a long series of tables.  The Summary Table is used to provide a sense of your product’s overall “level-of-conformance” with the Section 508 Standards.  Subsequently, the Section 1194.xx Tables contain the detailed subparagraphs that a Section 508 Standard is composed of.  It is within these Section 1194.xx Tables that you will define in detail how your product did or did not comply with a specific requirement.



Understanding the columns



Use the following to understand the use of the three columns in the Section 508 Evaluation Template’s tables:

 





What information do I enter in columns 2 and 3?



The Supporting Features and Remarks/Explanations columns are used to document exactly how a product did or did not meet the Section 508 Standards. 

















Typical Scenario for Completing a Section 508 Evaluation Template:



To complete the Section 508 Evaluation Template, enlist the services of your company’s technical specialist for the product being sought for purchase.  HHS requires a measure of technical detail in the responses.  Once you have enlisted their assistance:



Determine which sections of the Technical Standards (Subpart B-1194.21-26) apply to your product.* Keep in mind that you always must complete the Functional Performance Criteria (Subpart C – 1194.31) and Information, Documentation, and Support (Subpart D – 1194.41) sections of the Section 508 Evaluation Template. 



For each section that applies, determine if the product does or does not meet the specific Criteria elements.



Using the information found in the  section, document in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how your product did or did not meet the applicable standard.



If the product supports the standard, provide detailed examples of what accessibility features exist and how they are used to support the standard.



If the product does not support the standard, remember that Section 508 allows products to meet the Access Board Standards in innovative, non-traditional ways. The product can meet the standard by providing an innovative solution, as long as the feature performs in the same manner as it does for any other user without a disability. 



If the product does not possess an innovative, non-traditional way of supporting the standard, provide detailed examples of exactly how the product did not meet the standard.  



Once documented in the Section 1194.xx Tables exactly how the product did or did not meet, return to the Summary Table and document the product’s overall “level-of-conformance” in each of the applicable sections.



Post the final Section 508 Evaluation Template on your company's web site or on the . 

 

It is the Vendor's responsibility to maintain the integrity of the data on the Section 508 Evaluation Template. The information provided on the Section 508 Evaluation Template is considered a self-representation unless expressly affirmed otherwise. Even so, HHS uses this form to complete required Market Research associated with the agency complying with Section 508 and may use the form to eliminate this product compared to other more accessible products that meet the HHS business needs.
