The notification shall include the information required by paragraphs (f)(1)(i) through (f)(1)(iv) of this clause.

Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award

2-85A

Evaluation Inclusive of Options

01/01/2003

(a) The judiciary will evaluate offers for purposes of award by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options does not obligate the judiciary to exercise the option(s). (b) Any offer that is materially unbalanced as to prices for basic and option quantities may be rejected. An unbalanced offer is one that is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices that are significantly overstated for other work. (END) M.1 Evaluation Process

See Sections M.1.1 through M.1.2.3 below. M.1.1 General

1. This procurement is being conducted using formal source selection procedures, and contract award(s) will be made to the Offeror(s) whose proposal(s) conforms to the solicitation, and is determined to be most advantageous to the Government in accordance with the requirements stated below.

2. The evaluation will be conducted using the evaluation criteria as set forth in this Section. Each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. Proposal clarification/revision requests may be issued which encompass any and all written documentation submitted in response to the RFP as may be deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer to fully explore and evaluate the merits of proposals submitted.

M.1.2

Evaluation Approach

Each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation shall be evaluated for technical acceptability, technical approach, and price reasonableness. M.1.2.1 Technical Acceptability Evaluation

USCA09R0024 - Page 32 of 32

To be considered technically acceptable, the proposal shall be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror acknowledges and certifies that it can meet the requirements established in Sections C.5, C.6 and C.7 of the solicitation. The Government reserves the right to seek clarifications or deficiency corrections prior to determining a proposal technically unacceptable. M.1.2.2 Technical Approach Evaluation

The Technical Approach Factors will be evaluated based upon the information contained in the Offeror's proposal, as well as any other outside information available to the Government that pertains to the Offeror's technical approach. The Technical Approach Factors identified below are listed in descending order of importance. The proposals will be evaluated based on the evaluation factors set forth.

Technical Approach Factors

A. Recruitment/Staffing/Retention/Employee Development Plans (L.4.2.1) B. Past Performance (L.4.2.2) C. Past Experience (L.4.2.2) D. Key Personnel (L.4.2.3) M.1.2.3 Price Evaluation

The Offeror's proposed pricing will be evaluated for reasonableness. Offers that are unrealistically high or low in price will be considered indicative of a lack of understanding of the complexity and risk associated with work performed under the resulting contract. Offers that contain unrealistic prices will not be considered for award. M.2 Contract Award

The Government intends to award an estimated three(3) - six(6) contracts resulting from this solicitation that meet all of the requirements of Section C specifically Sections C.5, C.6 and C.7. Contract award(s) will be made to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer(s) confoms to the requirements of the solicitation and represents the best overall value to the Government, given the outcome of the Government's evaluation of each Offeror's technical proposal and price. For this solicitation, technical merit is more important than price. In selecting the best overall value, the Government will consider the quality offered for the evaluated price. The relative ranking of offers will be based upon the Government's assessment of whether the technical merit offered in the proposal provides added value, added capability, and/or reduced risk. As technical merit of the offerors' proposals becomes more equal, the evaluated price may become the determining factor. The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and price promises the greatest value to the Government, price and other factors considered. 3-70 Determination of Responsibility 01/01/2003

A determination of responsibility will be made on the apparent successful offeror prior to contract award. If the prospective contractor is found non-responsible, that offeror will be rejected and will receive no further consideration for award. In the event a contractor is rejected based on a determination of non-responsibility, a determination will be made on the next apparent successful offeror. (END)
