STATEMENT OF WORK: DIVISION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS BROADCAST MEDIA MONITORING SERVICES
Purpose: The purpose of this Statement of Work is to establish a service agreement subscription with a commercial broadcast media monitoring service. FEMA is looking to select the best option for modernizing and standardizing the media monitoring efforts for Joint Field Office (JFO) TV news monitoring and FEMA headquarters broadcast operations. Background: The Federal Emergency Management Agency's Office of External Affairs is responsible for the effective dissemination of accurate information to the public concerning FEMA's programs, missions and goals for emergency management. FEMA External Affairs provides primary support to the FEMA Administrator, Deputy Administrator and FEMA senior leadership, with primary responsibility for the communication of agency goals, objectives and accomplishments. In addition, the Office is responsible for the preparation and distribution of critical response and recovery information to state and local officials, agency stakeholders and the general public. This on-going requirement has FEMA External Affairs staff deployed to Joint Filed Offices (JFO), who continually monitor local broadcast media news reports as they relate to agency operations in the field. In addition, requirements are needed at the FEMA Headquarters to update and standardize a method for capturing local broadcast news from a JFO as well as nationally broadcast news and cable outlets. Within the Office of External Affairs, the Public Affairs Division is responsible for the monitoring, archiving, and measurement of media representation, which includes broadcast TV, radio, and cable news media. The broadcast media are relied upon to deliver disaster information in a reliable, efficient and expeditious manner. Both live and pre-recorded materials are distributed to the broadcast news and independent production media via satellite transmission, the internet and other delivery services. To monitor the effectiveness of public affairs messaging, and respond to critical events, FEMA requires the ability to monitor and retrieve clips and transcripts from network and local television affiliates in a rapid manner upon demand 24/7 through an on-line distribution service. Scope of Work: The contractor shall provide at least 11 accessible accounts or individual passwords to access the service (with a potential surge capacity to 40 if needed during extremely high disaster activity). The service shall provide unlimited online access to clips from all U.S. television networks and major Nielsen markets 24/7. The service shall provide a means to download an unlimited number of clips and transcripts for internal FEMA distribution to key individuals upon demand. The service shall provide media statistics including the audience exposure and publicity value. The service shall have a means of delivering clips or notification of clips via email to key individuals as assigned by FEMA. The service shall allow for unlimited digital clips, unlimited keyword searches, permanent archive, and editing capabilities. It would be preferable not to need to purchase additional equipment or software. Contract Period: The performance period for this subscription is one year from the date of the subscription initiation with (3) annual options for renewal.
