1.0 Introduction and Background

Introduction

Hunters wanting to hunt deer or turkeys on Land Between The Lakes National Recreation Area (LBL) quota hunts must apply and be drawn for a quota
hunt permit.  The Contractor shall develop and administer two online Quota Hunt Application System (QHAS) websites, one for deer hunt
applications and one for turkey hunt applications.  For each game species, the website shall collect applicant information and store it in a
format that can be downloaded into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  During the application periods (month of February for turkey hunts and month
of July for deer hunts) the Forest Service (FS) staff at LBL will have real-time access to the website for corrections and to enter phone-in
applications with differential pricing for those who do not have computer access.  At the close of the application period, LBL will download the
Microsoft Excel database spreadsheet with all applicant information.  LBL will manage the quota hunt drawing, and assignment of permits and
preference points.  Upon completion of the drawing, LBL will deliver to the Contractor via email a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with applicant
information, hunt assignments and updated preference points.  Contractor will then make this information available to applicants through the
respective websites.  Applicants will log back into the website to check their draw status and, if drawn will print a permit containing hunter
identification and details of the hunt (dates, area, bag limit, etc.).  The website shall be attractive, convenient and easy to use, accept
credit card payment for application fees, enable hunters to check draw status and print their permits, and generate Excel spreadsheets
containing all applicant information, hunt choices, etc.

Background

Hunting is a very popular and important recreation activity on LBL.  Due to the popularity of deer and turkey hunting, and to provide for a safe
and quality hunt, the QHAS was developed to manage the number and distribution of hunters for these hunts.  Additionally, because the number of
applicants exceeded the number of available permits, a preference point system was developed to insure that hunters who applied repeatedly would
receive a permit on a periodic basis.  Each time a hunter applies and is not drawn for a hunt, they receive a preference point that increases
their standing in successive drawings.  Currently, 7,000 to 9,000 hunters apply annually during the month of July for quota deer hunts, and
2,000 to 2,500 apply during the month of February for quota turkey hunts.  The current system uses a username containing personally identifiable
information (PII) to link hunters with their preference points.  However, a new username needs to be developed that does not contain PII.

This requirement is also included in the Centralized Reservation, Sales, Data Collection, and Revenue Management System, solicitation AG-4870-S-
13-0003.  LBL may award through the integrated solicitation or through this synopsis/solicitation as a stand-alone contract.  The primary
requirement of this initial award is to have a fully active production site no later than February 1, 2013.


2.0 Objectives

To provide an online QHAS that shall:
1) Be attractive and easy to use for applicants, including those with very little to no computer experience.  All information on the website
shall use correct English grammar, punctuation, and spelling.
2) Meet the business and information needs of LBL.  The integrated, comprehensive QHAS will allow LBL to collect, track, monitor, record and
report data on a year-to-year basis; develop trends; and project program demands and support requirements.
3) May be integrated with LBL’s Customer Reservation System (CRS), Point-of-Sale System, Business Management System, and Website (current
contracted and being solicited under AG-4870-S-13-0003).  Possible optional future applications to be developed may include online hunter check-
in or other applications.
4) Provide new hunt dates, quotas, instructions, and information each year, and/or links to such information on LBL’s website.
5) Capture the data needed for the quota hunt drawing in a Microsoft Excel file to be imported into LBL’s quota hunt drawing application.  Data
to be collected is specified in 4.0 Performance Requirements.
6) Collect fees for the applications submitted.  Fees may be different for an online application vs a call-in application entered by LBL
personnel (Prices subject to change.)
7) LBL will send periodic email notifications to applicants regarding when to apply, when drawing results are available, etc.  Contractor will
post the results of the drawing on the website in the applicant’s account so they can log back in with a user ID and password, determine draw
status, check preference points, and print their permit if drawn.

3.0 Scope

Note:  This scope of work may be modified after a discovery phase meeting with the Contractor.

The Systems covered by this Performance Work Statement (PWS) are part of a comprehensive, multi-level, integrated, and interactive system.  The
system will be designed with flexibility to allow for future development to modify, improve and/or expand usability.  Future capabilities and
changes to existing functions shall be developed, tested, validated, and documented by the Contractor and follow Federal guidelines, Forest
Service policies, handbooks, manuals, land use plans, professional journals, and technical publications.

The Contractor shall develop, test, configure, validate, implement, and administer a functional online QHAS that meets the requirements of LBL.
The Contractor is solely responsible for providing and maintaining the applications, website, databases, and documentation to perform the
requirements of the QHAS under this contract. The application functions include, but are not limited to: application system, financial controls,
and the collection of accurate data to be compiled into the all-encompassing electronic database system accessible via interactive web.  The
Contractor is ultimately responsible for the total and complete development of the interactive web page, including but not limited to all
necessary updates and changes.

To enable functionality of the QHAS, the Contractor shall integrate existing databases from LBL and convert usernames of existing accounts to a
new username format without PII.  Hunt applicants must be able to easily and quickly access the QHAS to determine dates to apply for hunts,
available hunt options, hunt areas, current preference points (before applying), status in the drawing (e.g. drawn or rejected) and print
permits.  The Contractor shall collaborate with LBL’s Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) to assure information needs are being met.
Additionally, the Contractor shall respond to specific information requests regarding performance indicators and customer information.

The Contractor is responsible for maintaining the QHAS system and correcting any related issues in an expedient manner.

The Contractor shall develop and submit a Preventive Maintenance Plan (PMP) including frequency and duration of the preventive maintenance
required for the equipment and software. Preventive maintenance shall be scheduled to be performed so as not to interfere with the Government’s
operations. The PMP shall include, but is not limited to:  details for virus protection updates, software upgrades, upgrading the server
operating system, other upgrades for PC/server programs, and backups. The PMP shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer (CO) within 45
business days of contract award and be updated quarterly to reflect changes in the PM program. A PM log shall be kept either on paper or
electronically and shall be submitted to the COR annually or more frequently if requested.

The Contractor shall perform continuous backups of the QHAS databases and web servers during the application periods so as not to interfere with
Government operations and to ensure no loss of data.  At the end of each application period validated copies of the data backup shall be
delivered to the CO to ensure no substantial loss by the Contractor of data stored. All data, applications and software shall remain the
property of the Government after contract has been completed.

The Contractor shall develop and submit an implementation schedule to the CO for the QHAS within 15 calendar days of award.

The Contractor shall provide and maintain web server administration, web server update(s), web server backup, web server programming, website
development, website hosting, website setup, website design, and website updates for the QHAS.

4.0 Performance Requirements

      The Quota Hunt Online Application System shall:

   1. Provide an attractive and user friendly website for hunters to apply for LBL’s deer and turkey quota hunts.
   2. Provide clear instructions on how to apply, and appropriate information for the current hunt season (dates, rules, etc.) subject to change
      from one application period to the next (Attachment 1).
   3. The Contractor shall recommend the format for a new user ID that is unique to each applicant, will track preference points, but does not
      contain PII (current user ID is date of birth and last four digits SSN).  Format shall be approved by LBL.  Convert the existing user ID of
      each applicant currently in the database to the new format, and inform applicants of the change, or if appropriate have them convert to new
      format.  When the transition to the new user ID is completed, all PII remaining in the system will be deleted.
   4. Allow new applicants to create an online account with user ID and password.  The user ID and password will be the same format as in #3
      above.
   5. Application process and information collected shall include but is not limited to:
     a. First Name
     b. Middle Initial
     c. Last Name
     d. Area Code and Telephone Number
     e. Email address
     f. Gender
     g. Street name and address
     h. City
     i. Two letter state code
     j. Five digit zip code
     k. User ID (unless generated by the system)
     l. Password
     m. Applicant will create a password with 4 – 10 characters.
     n. User ID and password will be used whenever accessing the system in the future to check draw status or apply for future hunts, and track
        preference points.
     o. System will provide a method for applicants to recover their password if it is forgotten.
     p. After the above is completed, applicant will have the option to start a new application or join an existing group.  The current rules
        for starting a new application or joining a group are listed in Attachment 2.
     q. If applicant chooses to start a new application, the next option will be to choose KY or TN state portion of LBL to hunt.  If applicant
        chooses to join a group go to step “v.”
     r. The next option will be to choose first second and third choice of hunt codes and first, second and third choice of hunt areas for that
        state portion.  Hunt code choices includes the option to apply for a preference point.  Guidelines for selecting hunt areas and hunt
        codes are listed in Attachment 3 – note that hunt area choices only apply to deer hunts and not to turkey hunts.
     s. Applicant will then be directed to a payment page which will list his/her hunt choices and area choices, the cost of the application,
        and allow entry of credit card account information.  Before submitting payment, applicant must verify that they agree to abide by rules
        and regulations listed in the appropriate deer or turkey hunting information sheet with a link to that sheet on LBL’s website.
        Applicant shall also be asked to make sure hunt choices are correct because no changes can be made after payment is submitted.
     t. After payment is submitted and accepted, applicant receives a five-digit group number (expandable to six-digits in the future if
        needed), confirmation of hunt choices and hunt area choices, a group list showing only himself/herself at this point, his/her current
        preference points to be applied in the upcoming drawing, and a draw status pending with date of drawing listed.  Also an email is sent
        to the email address that was entered with date, receipt of payment, hunt code and hunt area choices.
     u. When a youth applies for a youth hunt, the system will ask if the youth is eligible based on date of birth and date of youth hunt.  If
        eligible the application process can continue, and if not eligible will allow other hunt choices to be selected.
     v. Up to five hunters may currently apply as a group (this number may increase in the future).  If the applicant at step “p” above choses
        to join a group, he/she is prompted to enter the five-digit group number, and the group leader’s last name (group leader was the person
        who started the group).
     w. Applicant joining the group is then directed to a page showing the hunt code and hunt area choices selected by the group leader which
        cannot be changed.
     x. Applicant is then directed to the payment page to enter credit card account information, and verify that they agree to abide by rules
        and regulations listed in the appropriate deer or turkey hunting information sheet with a link to that sheet on LBL’s website.
     y. After payment is submitted and accepted, applicant receives a five-digit group number, confirmation of hunt choices and hunt area
        choices, a group list showing all current members of the group and preference points for each to be applied in the upcoming drawing, and
        a draw status pending with date of drawing listed.  Also an email is sent to the current applicant’s email address with date, receipt of
        payment, hunt code and hunt area choices.
     z. Upon completion of the drawing, applicant will log back into website with user ID and password to check status.  If not drawn, updated
        preference point balance will be shown.  If drawn, applicant will print their permit (Attachment 4).
   6. The QHAS shall provide each applicant the opportunity to verify and correct any input information.  Pop-ups will appear at several steps to
      warn the applicant to be certain that information is correct before continuing.  Pop-ups shall include verification of information entered,
      and whenever trying to advance to the next step without all required information shall inform applicant specifically what is missing.
   7. The QHAS shall record the date and time of application and send a confirmation email as indicated above.
   8. The QHAS shall collect the appropriate application fee for each applicant.  Payment by  credit  card  or  debit  card  shall  be  accepted.
      Transactions are processed by an agency-required payment system; funds to be deposited in an account owned by  LBL.   The  system  will  be
      required to interface with Verifone Payware Connect credit card gateway in order  to  allow  credit  card  sales  within  LBL  and  related
      properties for sales conducted by LBL staff.  It is the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure that  their  system  is  in  compliance  with
      Verifone’s polies and rules.  Note: At contract award, the financial system is Verifone, but the system may be changed at  a  future  time.
      The system shall be capable of transitioning to different financial systems, should it be required.
   9. QHAS shall also provide hunters the option to go online after the drawing to check their status in the draw.

  13. If the hunter has applied in previous years, upon log-in with user ID and password the hunter’s existing preference points shall be
      displayed.
  14. Contractor shall allow LBL administrative access to the website throughout the application period to conduct searches of the database, to
      make corrections to applicant information, and upon completion of the application period to download Microsoft Excel database of all
      information collected and/or generated in order to conduct the drawing.
  15. LBL will be responsible to conduct the drawing and assign permits and preference points.
  16. Upon completion of the drawing, LBL will deliver to Contractor the results including permit assignments and updated preference points.

      accurate and generate test quota hunt permits.  After verifying that everything is correct Contractor will allow LBL to run final checks
      and test permits.  Then, at the pre-scheduled date and time, website will be made available to applicants.  LBL will email applicants a
      notice to log in to the website, check results, and print permits.
  17. Information collected shall be searchable by LBL using various queries and capable of producing reports.

   18.      Payment card industry data security standards shall be followed so that personal information of customers is protected. QHAS shall
      have the ability to contain adequate security measures for protection against sale or disclosure of information contained in any personally
      identifiable record of customers, except as authorized and/or required by applicable law or requested in writing by LBL.   Information
      collected on the website is subject to protection under the Privacy Act, and shall be strictly protected and secured by the Contractor, and
      shall not be used, distributed, released or made available in any form or fashion by the Contractor to anyone or any entity other than USDA

      secure at all times.


5.0 Business Rules for LBL’s Quota Hunts

    ■ Hunt Areas are assigned for quota deer hunts but not for quota turkey hunts.  LBL’s hunt program presently includes 18 hunt areas:  Areas
      1 – 10 and 17-18 are in KY and areas 11 – 16 are in TN.  Also include as an area choice “any available area”(in KY/TN as appropriate) for
      those who do not have an area preference, and as a default for turkey hunts.
    ■ The program shall allow LBL to:
         o Define game species and type to hunt (e.g. white-tailed deer, buck only, either sex, turkey with visible beard, etc.)
         o Define hunt dates available, which will change each year
         o Define hunts as youth hunt, regular hunt, specialty hunt, etc.
         o Set the beginning and ending dates applications will be accepted
         o Set the date quota drawing results will be available on the internet
         o Specify weapon restriction (e.g:  conventional firearm, muzzle-loader, archery, crossbow, etc.)
         o Inquire about applicant’s eligibility for a youth hunt based on the state requirements and youth’s age on the first day of the hunt.
           QHAS shall also notify youth applicants of LBL’s current hunter safety requirements which are subject to change.
         o Allow from one to maximum number of hunters in a group (currently five with option to increase).
         o Provide the choices of hunts and/or areas a hunter may apply for (1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, etc).
         o Provide a link to rules for the drawing so that hunters understand how the drawing works.
    ■ Program shall check for duplicate applications (and preclude duplicate applications)
         o If hunter attempts to apply and already has an application in the system, the QHAS will notify the hunter during the registration
           process and will not allow a second entry.
    ■ Data shall be retained for a minimum of the three most recent years prior to the current year for turkey hunts, and five years for deer
      hunts.
    ■ QHAS shall assign a unique identifier, to be determined by Contractor and approved by LBL, to each applicant for tracking applicant and
      preference points.  The unique identifier will replace the current six-digit birth date of the applicant (mmddyy) plus the last four digits
      of their SSN.  When the transition to the new user ID is completed, all PII remaining in the system will be deleted.
    ■ QHAS shall allow for applicants to apply for a “preference point” option in lieu of a hunt to build preference points for a future hunt.
    ■ If a youth, based on state law (6-16 in TN, and age 15 and under in KY) is applying for a regular hunt, they can ONLY apply in a group
      that has at least one adult age 21 or older for each youth who joins the group.  This adult must remain with the youth at all times while
      hunting.  QHAS shall inform applicants to not register a youth to join a group that will not contain an available adult to accompany each
      youth.
    ■ QHAS shall identify for applicants the number of permits (by type) in each area that will be available for each hunt.
    ■ QHAS shall take payment via credit and debit cards.
    ■ If the maximum group size has been attained, additional hunters shall not be allowed to join that group.
    ■ QHAS shall preclude completion of an application until all required data is collected, and payment is accepted.
    ■ Contractor shall meet production schedules for deer and turkey hunt application periods as determined by LBL and agreed upon by Contractor
      prior to each application period.  (Attachments 5 & 6).
    ■ Sample LBL turkey and deer hunting information sheets for hunters are attached.  (Attachments 7 & 8).

6.0 User’s Manual
The Contractor shall provide a User’s Manual for the QHAS application system to the Government.  The user manual shall provide a general
overview of how the system works so that the Government can provide meaningful input on future improvements or troubleshooting.  The user manual
shall provide clear and easy to follow instructions to the Government on how to administratively access the system, perform data searches and
queries, make edits or corrections to applicant information, how to use the phone-in application function with differential pricing, how to
download MS Excel spreadsheets of applicant information to conduct the drawing, etc.  Anytime substantive changes are made to the system, the
Contractor shall provide the Government an updated User’s Manual within 30 days after the changes have been made.

|2013 LBL QUOTA HUNT APPLICATION SYSTEM                                                                                                                          |
|You can apply for 2013 Deer Hunts from July 1 through July 31. The application fee is $5. If you are interested in learning how the quota hunt drawing works    |
|click here . If you want to apply as a group, the group leader will have to be the first in the group to apply. The leader will be assigned a group number after|
|the credit card payment has been accepted. The leader can then provide the group number for others to join the group. Any additional persons who join the group |
|after the leader has applied will be required to enter the group number and group leader’s last name before they can proceed with their application. A group can|
|consist of one to five hunters. Note that youth hunters can only apply for a youth hunt or with an adult for a regular hunt, but not for both.                  |

Attachment 3.  Guidelines for hunt code and hunt area selection
                 • If starting a new group select your choices and submit your application.
                 • If you are joining a group you cannot make any choices here because your choices have already been made by the group leader.
                 • Hunt Areas are not assigned for Turkey Hunts
                 • If you are unable to hunt this year, choose Preference Point instead of hunt choices to increase your points for future years.


                 • Hunters must be licensed for the respective state portion of LBL in which they hunt. If applying for a preference point be
                   sure to select appropriate code.
Attachment 4.  Quota Hunt Permit that is generated and will print with hunter’s information on 8 ½ x 11 printer paper.  This example is for deer
hunts (slightly different wording for turkey hunts).  Information for each field will be supplied by LBL except bar code.  Contractor will
generate the bar code, which will be the supplied permit number converted to bar code format.  Permit is sized correctly and when cut and folded
will be the same size as a standard credit card.



Congratulations!  Please print this page.  The permit below must be carried with you in the field while hunting.  In addition to this permit, a
state hunting license and deer permit for the state portion you are hunting is required according to state regulations, and hunters age 16 and
older must also possess a valid LBL Hunter Use Permit.  You can view and print the LBL Deer Hunting Information Sheet and hunt area maps from
LBL’s website at www.lbl.org.
We hope you have a safe and memorable hunt at Land Between The Lakes!

[List as necessary]
      (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25. For line items covered by the WTO
      GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy
      American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting
      Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the
      requirements of the solicitation.
(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
-
   (1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any
   Federal agency;
   (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them
   for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local
   government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of
   embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal
   criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
   (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of
   these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
   (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that
   exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally
        determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the
        liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full
        payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review
        of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court
        review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice
        under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further
        appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to
        contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a
        delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax
        liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in
        full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full
        payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under
        11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in
paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor
Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

|                                                                  |                                                                  |
|                                                                  |                                                                  |

statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to

      (i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or
      subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business
      operations;
      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD





52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items (JAN 1999)

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation
will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
  1. Past Performance.  The proposal shall reflect the prime contractor’s past experience on similar projects completed over the past five (5)
     years.  Experience is relevant when the offeror has been confronted with the kinds of work, challenges, and volume that will be present
     under the contract contemplated.  The offeror will be assessed by the relevant experience on the basis of its breadth and its depth.
  2. Technical approach.  The proposals shall reflect the offeror’s understanding of the project and its potential problems, the offeror’s
     ability to meet the requirements specified in the PWS, and the offeror’s proposed solutions for the requirements specified in the PWS.  The
     approach/solution should describe the resources to be used and the milestones/schedule for the overall project.  Technical approach shall
     not exceed thirty (30) pages.  Past performance and staffing is not considered part of the thirty page limit.
  3. Price.  The price factor will be rated approximately equal to all other factors combined.  The price proposals will be evaluated against the
     Government Price Estimate, as well as other price proposals received. The estimate will be used as a benchmark for which the price
     evaluation will be conducted. The analysis of the variance between the Government's estimate and each offer and variance among the offerors
     will indicate whether further review is necessary in order to determine if the price is realistic. Additional review may be performed by
     both the technical board and the Contracting Officer.

Award will be made to the offeror(s) whose proposed technical/cost relationship is the most advantageous to the Government. Evaluation factors
other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price in the award decision. Evaluation factors other than price are approximately
equal to each other.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic
requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options
shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance
specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time,
the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of
withdrawal is received before award.

____________________________________________________________________________________

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.81 per hour or $152.40 per week or $660.40 per month

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.
Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the
predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A contractor may substitute for any of the
named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)

THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a
bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer System Analysts and
Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an
hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541. 400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all
occupations within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate for some or all occupations within
those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances
may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within
the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA
wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance
note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of
the computer professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements and
whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or
system functional specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including
prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will
earn a night differential and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic
pay plus a Sunday premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime (i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside
the normal tour of duty is considered overtime work).

HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard
when working with or in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as screening, blending,
dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordinance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash
powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.
  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations
on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close
proximity to ordinance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials which involves potential injury such as
laceration of hands, face, or arms of the employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; minimal damage to
immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordinance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials are only applicable to work that has been specifically
designated by the agency for ordinance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer,
by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an
expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The
Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees
for the actual cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all
contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing
for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and
maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and
wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning,
daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by
the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April
2006, unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home
page at http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the
contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the
contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and
the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by
such unlisted class(es) of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall be retroactive to the commencement
date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)} When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444 should be
prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency
(FGE) for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the
agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the
employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of
employees performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations
and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards
Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting
officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job
definitions to insure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination.   Remember, it is
not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not
be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
