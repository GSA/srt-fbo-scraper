Overview

The Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation) requires periodic on-site information technology support for the AmeriCorps
National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) North Central campus.  The campus does not have on-site information technology staff and require
general technical assistance for regular maintenance, ad hoc low priority support, and high priority emergency incidents.  The Corporation is
seeking an information technology contractor to fill the on-site support role on a time and materials contract.  This is a five year Blanket
Purchase Agreement (BPA).  Award will be made to the lowest cost, technically acceptable bidder.

Environment

The North Central Region campus is located in Vinton, Iowa and composed of two separate networks.  The Corporation administrative (Admin)
network, part of the Corporation’s national wide area network, provides Corporation staff members general file and print services and Internet
access.  The Admin network receives remote software support from the Corporation’s national helpdesk.  The Corps member (Lab) network,
physically isolated from the Admin network, provides Internet and network printing services to Corps members participating in NCCC programs.

The contractor will provide technical assistance to both Admin and Lab networks at the North Central Region campus.  The table below indicates
site locations and current number of wired workstations. The number may increase as the campus expands.

NCCC Admin networks are primarily based on Cisco networking equipment and HP workstations and printers.  NCCC Lab networks are generally based
on HP workstations and printers, but have a mixture of Cisco, 3Com, Linksys, and Netgear network components.

Initial Inventory and Site Survey

The contractor will be responsible for an initial site survey and inventory.  Following the site survey, the contractor will provide a network
diagram to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), in Microsoft Visio format of the Admin and Lab networks indicating the
physical topology and location of routers, switches, hubs, printers, workstations, and network wiring.  The contractor will provide a complete
hardware inventory of Corporation NCCC campus assets in Microsoft Excel format for all routers, switches, hubs, printers, and workstations.  The
inventory will provide the location, Corporation asset tag, manufacturer make, model, and serial number of equipment.  As part of standard
inventory reporting for the Admin networks, the contractor will assist staff in completing an on-line Intel LANDesk software inventory form for
workstations.

The contractor will assist in providing software configuration data for NCCC Lab networks.  It may be necessary to recover passwords on NCCC lab
equipment.  Configuration data will include administrative credentials for network devices, IP addressing and Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) scope information.  For wireless access points, the contractor will provide the Service Set Identifier (SSID), encryption
settings, and passphrases.

Digital photos of all internetworking equipment are provided.  The photos clearly document network connection points, including patch panels and
cable routes.

The contractor will provide a cost estimate for the initial inventory and site survey tasks.

Annual Inventory and Documentation Updates

The contractor will perform an annual inventory of the workstations and update all documentation provided in the initial inventory and site
survey.

The contractor will provide a cost estimate for the annual inventory and documentation update tasks, to the COTR, at the campus in a proposal
format that list tasks, time and estimate for each area.

Information Technology Support

The contractor will provide standard scheduled services as well as emergency services.  The contractor must respond to standard scheduled
requests with a written estimate within three (3) business days, and provide service within five (5) business days of authorization to proceed.
Emergency requests will require a written estimate within one (1) business day and service within one (1) business day following authorization
to proceed.  Authorization to proceed for all work will be issued by the Contracting Officer.
