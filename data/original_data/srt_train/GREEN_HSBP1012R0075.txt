BACKGROUND:

It is the mission of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to protect the nation's borders while facilitating legitimate trade and travel. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) primary mission is to promote homeland security and public safety through the criminal and civil enforcement of federal laws governing border control, customs, trade, and immigration. Both agencies must provide and manage the training for various types of law enforcement officers. The CBP Office of Training and Development (OTD) supports the CBP mission by coordinating and providing the training necessary to meet this mission. Both CBP and ICE require a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) web-based Academy Class Management System that will provide an effective and standardized method of managing various academies and training facilities, course curriculum, registration, evaluation and student transcripts and records. 2. SCOPE:

The contemplated contract will provide a solution for CBP, while providing ICE the option to join the contract in option period two. The software solution must be able to handle multiple locations, highly configurable, scalable to add more functionality and 508 compliant. Implementation of the new solution shall provide CBP with the ability to do the following: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Eliminate fragmented and redundant processes Reduce operational costs of residential training Reduce/eliminate costly paper-based field reporting Reduce litigation risks Increase training academy throughput Automate critical training administration functions to reduce reliance on contractor staff 7. Standardize law enforcement training procedures 8. Eliminate hardware-based scanning technology The management and accurate recordation of training is crucial to CBP as a law enforcement agency for tracking qualifications and certifications to ensure agents are qualified to perform their duties. Law enforcement training includes numerous complex assessment types with varying custom grading scales including unique attributes for physical fitness, firearms, defensive tactics and other skills-based assessments. Failure to accurately document these attributes could adversely affect CBP's mission. For example after a shooting incident it was learned that the CBP employee failed firearms, without that information the employee remained on the job and was not fired which led to a law suit. The successful completion of courses, exams, and assessments are major components that are evaluated for an agent to graduate from the academies and have complex weighting factors that must be calculated in the system and rolled up to graduation scores across the entire curriculum model. It is critical to support the various
1

assessment types and grading scales as well as maintain complete detailed training records. CBP currently has both a legacy ACMS and a .Net ACMS system which are both being utilized. The .Net ACMS system provides enterprise resource planning (ERP) and is very effective at managing complex law enforcement training and, field observation reporting across various locations at the enterprise level. The selected product must provide at a minimum the current functionality that CBP already has in place in the current .Net ACMS in the initial implementation. It must also provide a platform that will assist CBP in standardizing law enforcement training operations and provide a vehicle to ensure that each academy's programs meet the Federal Law Enforcement Training Accreditation (FLETA) guidelines while maintaining a secure, end-to-end training architecture. The selected product shall also need to incorporate the functionality that is in the legacy system as well as migrate historical data from both existing systems. Section 4 will provide a detailed listing of the academy class management requirements that are required for this solicitation. The selected product shall utilize or be compatible with the following to be acceptable and compatible with the current and future CBP infrastructure: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Database options - SQL server 2008 or Oracle 11G exadata Application tier options Windows 2008 server VM, .NET J2EE Exalogic/Weblogic 10.3.5/LINUX/Linux 5.6 Active directory (AD) (60K user GAL)) Windows 7 desktop (future) / Office 2010 IE 8, IE 9

Solicitation HSBP1012R0075 Page 12 of 42 CONTRACT TYPE (OCT 2008) This is a firm fixed price contract. (End of Clause)

CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY (MAR 2003) The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements of this contract. In the event the Contractor effects any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the changes will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in costs incurred as a result thereof. The Contracting Officer shall be the only individual authorized to accept nonconforming work, waive any requirement of the contract, or to modify any term or condition of the contract. The Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally obligate Government funds. No cost chargeable to the proposed contract can be incurred before receipt of a fully executed contract or specific authorization from the Contracting Officer. (End of Clause) SPECIAL SECURITY REQUIREMENT - CONTRACTOR PRE-SCREENING (SEP 2011) 1. Contractors requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive but unclassified information and/or logical access to Information Technology (IT) resources shall verify minimal fitness requirements for all persons/candidates designated for employment under any Department of Security (DHS) contract by pre-screening the person /candidate prior to submitting the name for consideration to work on the contract. Pre-screening the candidate ensures that minimum fitness requirements are considered and mitigates the burden of DHS having to conduct background investigations on objectionable candidates. The Contractor shall submit only those candidates that have not had a felony conviction within the past 36 months or illegal drug use within the past 12 months from the date of submission of their name as a candidate to perform work under this contract. Contractors are required to flow this requirement down to subcontractors. Pre-screening involves contractors and subcontractors reviewing: a. Felony convictions within the past 36 months. An acceptable means of obtaining information on felony convictions is from public records, free of charge, or from the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). b. Illegal drug use within the past 12 months. An acceptable means of obtaining information related to drug use is through employee self certification, by public records check; or if the contractor or subcontractor already has drug testing in place. There is no requirement for contractors and/or subcontractors to initiate a drug testing program if they do not have one already in place. c. Misconduct such as criminal activity on the job relating to fraud or theft within the past 12 months. An acceptable means of obtaining information related to misconduct is through employee self certification, by public records check, or other reference checks conducted in the normal course of business. 2. Pre-screening shall be conducted within 15 business days after contract award. This requirement shall be placed in all subcontracts if the subcontractor requires routine physical access, access to sensitive but unclassified information, and/or logical access to IT resources. Failure to comply with the pre-screening requirement will result in the Contracting Officer taking the appropriate remedy. Definition: Logical Access means providing an authorized user the ability to access one or more computer system resources such as a workstation, network, application, or database through automated tools. A logical access control system (LACS) requires validation of an individual identity through some mechanism such as a personal identification number (PIN), card, username and password, biometric, or

Solicitation HSBP1012R0075 Page 13 of 42 other token. The system has the capability to assign different access privileges to different persons depending on their roles and responsibilities in an organization. (End of Clause)

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and (3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and (4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to

Solicitation HSBP1012R0075 Page 33 of 42 contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] (1) Listed End Product Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:

Solicitation HSBP1012R0075 Page 40 of 42 *Addendum to FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 1 BASIS FOR AWARD

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offeror. The Government also reserves the right to award a contract based upon initial offers. The Government will make a single award resulting from this solicitation. 2 EVALUTION FACTORS

a. Factor 1, Technical Capability, is more important than factor 2, Past Performance. Factor 1, Technical Capability and factor 2, Past Performance, when combined, are approximately equal to factor 3, Price. b. Factor 1 will be rated based on an integrated assessment of the four (4) sub-factors: Technical Solution (sub-factor 1), Transition Plan (sub-factor 2), Project Management and Staffing (sub-factor 3), and Quality Control (sub-factor 4). Within factor 1, sub-factors 1 and 2 are considered to be of equal importance. Within factor 1, sub-factors 3 and 4 are considered to be of equal importance. Sub-factors 1 and 2 are more important than the sub-factors 3 and 4. c. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. The importance of price in the evaluation for award will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals.

d. Factors will be evaluated by the appropriate evaluation committee(s) of the Source Selection Advisory Committee (SSAC). Factor 1 will be given an adjectival rating and factor 2 will be given a confidence rating. e. The evaluation factors for this solicitation are as follows: Factor 1, Technical Capability: 1. Sub-Factor 1: Technical Solution

The Government will evaluate a comprehensive technical approach for satisfying the requirement to determine whether the Offeror has demonstrated a clear understanding of the work to be performed, including competent and thorough knowledge of the requirement(s) as stated in the SOW, as well as the resources, tools and methods to meet the requirement. The Offeror's proposal should demonstrate an excellent understanding of the SOW requirements and ability to support the DHS/CBP operational environment. 2. Sub-Factor 2: Transition Plan

The Offeror's Transition Plan will clearly show how the Offeror will minimize risk to the Government during a 30 day transition period from the incumbent Contractor. The required period is for the transition planning or program execution, associated with meeting the agreed to transition timeline. The plan will cover the following, at minimum: ˇ ˇ ˇ ˇ Overview of the transition effort; A detailed summary of all transition events and estimated milestone dates; Submission of all CBP BI packages; Date by which the Offeror will have sufficient, properly trained personnel to meet all Government SOW requirements.

Solicitation HSBP1012R0075 Page 41 of 42 If the Offeror's transition strategy includes hiring incumbent personnel, the plan must substantiate the Offeror's ability to hire incumbent personnel (i.e., a signed letter of intent) and must also include an alternate transition strategy and milestone dates if incumbent personnel refuse to accept the Offeror's offer. 3. Sub-Factor 3: Project Management and Staffing

The Government will evaluate the Offeror's overall approach in the management and implementation of the requirements and a summary of how the Offeror will effectively manage the project. This includes, risk identification and mitigation; responding to urgent and routine work requirements; an organizational chart containing names and functional titles of key personnel and associated teams; an overall approach to hire the required skilled staff and to maintain adequate staff during period of performance; a plan to ensure personnel are able to successfully pass a CBP Background Investigation (BI); and include the names and resumes of key personnel, with a short overview of their key skills and qualifications. Key personnel are to be available on the date of initial contract award. Irrespective of the status of BIs on remaining employees on the date of award, key personnel are to be available on date of award. 4. Sub-Factor 4: Quality Control

The Government will evaluate the offeror's ability to maintain an environment that mirrors Customs and Border Protection production environment for the purpose of user acceptance testing. The Contractor shall emulate the configurations that exist in the Customs and Border Protection production environment to include the current customizations. When code is ready to be submitted to Customs and Border Protection, the Office of Training and Development will access this environment and conduct acceptance testing to validate the defined requirements and system design have been met before the code can be implemented at Customs and Border Protection. The Contractor shall sufficiently document how quality will be planned, managed and tracked throughout the lifecycle of the project. Quality Control processes, procedures and the tools that will be utilized by the Contractor to ensure that quality will be maintained throughout all phases of the project should be included. Factor 2, Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offerors' Past Performance to determine the currency and relevancy of contractual requirements. Source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor's performance and any associated risk shall be considered. The Contractor's relevant Past Performance will be evaluated to assess the extent of their ability to perform the contract successfully. (1) In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (neutral evaluation). (2) The Government will consider past or current contracts (including Federal, State and local government and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement. The Government will consider information provided on problems encountered on the identified contracts and associated corrective actions. Offerors with a negative past performance rating will be afforded an opportunity to address alleged deficiencies. The Government may also consider information obtained from any other sources when evaluating past performance. Failure of an offeror to disclose a relevant Government contract with poor past performance may affect the offeror's past performance rating. (3) The Government may consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant.

Solicitation HSBP1012R0075 Page 42 of 42

(4) Evaluation of past performance will include an evaluation of the contractor's past performance in complying with the requirements of FAR clause 52.219-8, as applicable. Factor 3, Price: The Offeror's fixed price shall be evaluated using the Attachment B of this solicitation, completed by the Offeror. The pricing submitted will determine the total evaluated price of each offeror, inclusive of option periods. Fixed price proposals will be reviewed for reasonableness and affordability to determine whether they reflect an understanding of the requirements or contain apparent mistakes. The Offeror's proposed approach must be consistent with the price proposal. As part of the price evaluation, proposals may be reviewed to identify any significant unbalanced pricing. In accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), Unbalanced Pricing, a proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
