1.    PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

 (a)  To be considered for selection, the Offeror must submit a complete response to this Request for Quotation (RFQ) using the sequence and

 (b)  For the electronic submission, the offer/quote shall be in uncompressed files submitted via email.


 (c)  The electronic version of the text shall be in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat Portable Data Format (PDF).

 (d)  Information shall be confined to the appropriate volume folder/tab to facilitate independent evaluation.  The technical proposal/quote
should be clear and concise, logically assembled and indexed and cross-indexed to applicable parts of the RFQ as appropriate.  Pages over the
maximum-page limitation for any volume folder/tab will be excluded from evaluation.  The page limits shall include any diagrams, figures,
tables, or reference material, unless otherwise indicated in paragraph 2.c.  RESUMES ARE NOT A PART OF THE PAGE LIMITATION.


2.    FORMAT

(a)   Submissions.  Submissions shall be on 8 ½” x 11” (with no fold-outs) white paper and printed only on one side of the paper.  The text
shall have 1” margins on all sides, be single-spaced; font style Times New Roman; font color black; and font size 12.  Illustrations (e.g.,
graphics figures, graphs, and tables) shall be in portrait format with font colors other than black allowable and font sizes 12, 10, and 9 are
considered acceptable.  The Offeror’s company name (no logos), the date, solicitation number, volume number and section shall be included on
each page of the quotation/offer (may be included in a header/footer).  All pages of the quotation/offer shall be numbered, using a uniform-

requirement/objective, constraint, or terms and conditions to which exception is being made and include appropriate supporting rationale for
each exception.  The Government is not obligated to accept such exceptions to the RFQ, and these may render the Offeror’s proposal/quotation
unacceptable.

3.2   Section 2 – Technical/Managerial Approach and Key Personnel Qualifications

3.2.1  Technical/Managerial Approach:  Offeror must demonstrate its complete understanding of ATF’s tasks and deliverables by fully describing
its proposed technical/management approach to perform each task and deliverable specified under the SOW, including methods used and scheduling
of time.    Offeror must identify any technical barriers that your company would conceivably encounter in pursuing the required work and make

manage the tasks and deliverables in the SOW.  If the Offeror proposes subcontractors and/or teaming arrangements, the management plan shall
explain to what extent subcontractors and/or team members will be involved in the performance of the proposed tasks and how the Offeror will
manage the subcontractor and/or team member participation.     Officer shall identify its turnover rate for fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010.
Turnover rates shall be calculated using Bureau of Labor Statistics definition, which is “The number of total separations during the month

the number of total separations for the year divided by average monthly employment for the year (annual turnover).”  The Offeror shall address
its employee retention program, including but not limited to training programs, salary and benefits plans.

3.3   Section 3 – Past Performance

The evaluation will be based on past performance and price, past performance being more significant.  The Offeror shall provide references for a
maximum of three contracts/Orders with the Federal Government and/or commercial customers that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance
of similar scope, size and complexity of services identified.  Recent is defined as within the last three years.  Relevant is defined as work
similar in complexity, magnitude, and type of the work described in the SOW.

Offerors are instructed to send requests for references to the referenced party with instructions that they, in turn, should complete the “Past
Performance Survey”, Attachment III and send the information directly to the ATF Contracting Officer listed above.  The government may consider
the past performance of other companies when they are team members, affiliates, or significant subcontractors, who will perform major or
critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the acquisition; however, the offeror must clearly explain how these
other companies will be significantly involved in the proposed contract.  The Offeror shall provide a detailed summary of the work performed for
each past performance reference submitted.  Where possible, ATF intends to interview each reference provided to verify project scope, dollar
value and obtain additional past performance information.  The Solicitation Number is already identified on the past performance surveys.

The Offeror shall provide telephone, fax, and email for the points of contact for the technical and contractual personnel with each referenced
project as well as a description of the referenced contracts/task orders.

Contract Descriptions.  The description of each contract and subcontract shall include the following information in the task order listed:


      (a) Contract number.
      (b) Title of Program/Project.
      (c) Contract Type.
      (d) Period of performance.
      (e) Awarded price.
      (f) Final, or projected final, price.
      (g) Original delivery schedule.
      (h) Final, or projected final, delivery schedule.
      (i) Government/Commercial Contracting activity, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address.

The Government may also consider information obtained through other sources.  Past performance information will be utilized to determine the
quality of the contractor’s past performance as it relates to the probability of success of the required effort.  In this section the Offeror
will include demonstrated and relevant corporate experience, including subcontractors and teaming partners, in performing projects requiring the
type of services solicited.

3.4   Volume II – Price

3.4.1 General.  The Offeror shall ensure that all information is presented in an organized fashion to allow ATF to understand the cost of the
work to be performed.  The contract resulting from this solicitation shall be a Hybrid Firm-Fixed Price with Cost Reimbursement, for Travel
only.  In order to assess price reasonableness and amount:

3.4.1.1     The Offeror shall present the information via email using Microsoft Excel.

3.4.1.2     Section 1 shall contain the SF 1449 and a signed copy of each amendment, if any, to the solicitation.  An official authorized to
bind the company shall sign the SF 1449.   An acrobat file, “.pdf”, shall be created to capture the signatures for submission.

3.4.1.3  Section 2 shall contain specific pricing instructions that shall be followed in developing the price.  The Offeror shall submit its
Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure and pricing.  The Offeror shall be responsible for fully pricing out their solution, ensuring that
all requirements in the SOW are considered.  Pricing for optional tasks (if applicable) shall be separated.  The price must contain sufficient
information to allow the Contracting Office to perform an analysis of the proposed price of the work.  All pricing of the Offeror’s solution
shall be included.  The Offeror must include sufficient detail and any support material necessary to determine price reasonableness (i.e.:
breakdown of each CLIN by labor category/rates/hours).

4.  FORMAL COMMUNICATIONS

4.1.  The solicitation, amendments, notices and other information will be made via email.

4.2   Offerors are advised to monitor their email continuously in order to obtain information in a timely manner.

4.3         All questions pertaining to this solicitation shall be addressed to the Contracting
Specialist, Danielle Thompson, via e-mail, Danielle.Thompson2@atf.gov.    In order to issue pertinent and timely solicitation amendments, all
offerors’ questions must be received by 2pm EST Friday, April 8, 2011.

5.    CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  Any contractor (or member of its team and/or subcontractor) having a conflict of interest as defined under Far Part
9.5 must identify the conflict as soon as it is known and provide a recommended mitigation plan.  Mitigation plans are required whenever a
competing contractor has had unequal access to non-public information regarding this requirement and/or competition, or has assisted the
Government in defining the requirements or evaluation criteria.

6.    EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

6.1   EVALUATION PROCESS

      (a)   The Government intends to award a single contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer/quote,
      conforming to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous to the Government, past performance and price considered.

      (b)   The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option pricing is significantly unbalanced. 

      (c)   A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer/quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time
      for acceptance specified in the offer/quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the
      offer's/quote’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer/quote, whether or not there are negotiations after its
      receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

6.2        BASIS FOR AWARD

expertise, hardware, and software necessary to provide system support services in order to deliver a complete turnkey solution for A2K.  The
contract awarded as a result of this solicitation shall be a Firm-Fixed Price with Cost-Reimbursement for Travel only.  ATF may award without
discussions; however, ATF will hold discussions, if deemed in the best interest of the Government.

|Outstanding = 5                |The Offeror has clearly demonstrated its ability to perform the work defined in the SOW.  The proposal possesses    |
|                               |numerous (5 or more) significant strengths and no significant weaknesses.                                           |
|Very Good = 4                  |The Offeror has clearly demonstrated its ability to perform the work defined in the SOW.  The proposal possesses one|
|                               |or more significant strengths and no significant weaknesses.                                                        |
|Acceptable = 3                 |The proposal meets the minimum requirements of the SOW.  Areas where the proposal may exceed the minimum            |
|                               |requirements are considered to be of minor or no value to the Government.  There are no significant strengths or    |
|                               |they are offset by several significant weaknesses.                                                                  |
|Marginal = 2                   |The Offeror’s performance of previous relevant contracts demonstrates a general trend that supports an expectation  |
|                               |that successful achievement of the SOW requirements may be difficult to achieve or can occur only with increased    |
|                               |levels of ATF oversight.                                                                                            |
|Unacceptable = 0               |The proposal fails to meet the minimum requirements of the SOW and has significant deficiencies or omissions and/or |

Factor 2:  Past Performance.

The Offeror will be evaluated on its past performance.  Offerors shall submit a maximum of three (3) references for recent (within the past
three (3) years) and relevant experience (i.e., experience in providing the services required in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The Government
may use information provided by the Offeror in their quotation submission, information in both Government and commercial databases, and other
information available as ATF determines is reasonable.

Offerors shall be asked to provide the organization name, technical, and contractual points of contact, the dollar value and period of
performance (dates), a three (3) page or less description of the project or contract referenced and the Offeror’s rationale as to the relevance
of the experience to the prospective work to be performed under this solicitation.  ATF shall assess the relevance of the experience and
references provided to the work to be performed under the contract/task order to be awarded under this solicitation and evaluate the Offeror’s
relevant experience and related past performance (how well the Offeror performed on the referenced project).  If the Offeror has no past
performance readily available (FAR 15.306 (a)(2)(iv)), it will be evaluated as Neutral.  References shall submit responses directly to the CO or
CS no later than the date and time quotations and past performance surveys are due, Friday, April 15, 2011, 2pm, EST.

The Government will evaluate past performance quality using the following adjectival ratings for the factor.

|Past Performance Ratings                                                                                                                  |
|Outstanding = 5                |The Offeror’s performance of previous relevant contracts demonstrates an overall performance and quality |
|                               |record that supports an extremely strong expectation of successful achievement of the SOW requirements.  |
|Good = 4                       |The Offeror’s performance of previous relevant contracts demonstrates an overall performance and quality |
|                               |record that supports a strong expectation of successful achievement of the SOW requirements.             |
|Acceptable = 3                 |The Offeror’s performance of previous relevant contracts demonstrates an overall performance and quality |
|                               |record that supports an expectation of satisfactory achievement of the great majority of SOW             |
|                               |requirements.                                                                                            |
|Marginal = 2                   |The Offeror’s performance of previous relevant contracts demonstrates a general trend that supports an   |
|                               |expectation that successful achievement of the SOW requirements may be difficult to achieve or can occur |
|                               |only with increased levels of ATF oversight.                                                             |
|Unacceptable =0                |The Offeror’s performance of previous relevant contracts demonstrates a general trend that supports a    |
|                               |strong expectation that successful achievement of the SOW requirements cannot be achieved.               |
|Neutral = No Rating            |No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no directly     |
|                               |related or similar relevant past performance experience.                                                 |

Factor 3:  Price.  Please submit detailed Pricing.  Price shall be evaluated for amount and reasonableness.  The total evaluated price shall be
the sum of the prices for all proposed labor categories and rates as calculated by the Offeror and for the CLINs as they relate to the Tasks,
Deliverables and Optional Deliverables in the SOW.    Offerors must submit a copy of their professional compensation plan which shall be
evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees.   Price will not be evaluated adjectivally.

The Contractor must submit a copy of a tentative employment offer with the personnel suitability and security package when it is submitted on a potential Contractor employee. The Contractor is hereby advised that a background investigation may take sixty (60) days or more to complete, depending on the complexity of the background investigation. The Contractor is encouraged to fill all positions with employees who have recently been the subject of a Federal background investigation. At the conclusion of the background investigation, the Personnel Security Branch will make a favorable or unfavorable determination and advise the COTR and the Contracting Officer (CO). The CO or the COTR is responsible for advising the Contractor of ATF's determination. Contractor employees are not authorized to access ATF proprietary information, information technology systems, and/or facilities, until a favorable determination has been made by the Personnel Security Branch in accordance with agency specific qualifications, DOJ policy, Federal suitability, and/or adjudicative guidelines. All background investigations will be adjudicated applying the suitability standards under 5 CFR, part 731, as well as the following DOJ policy and ATF agency specific qualifications: (1) DOJ Residency Requirement.

(2) Allied Nations List. Contractor employees that only require access to ATF facilities must be United States citizens or foreign nationals legally permitted to reside in the United States. Their country of citizenship must be listed on the Allied Nations list published by the Department of State, Office of the Assistant Legal Advisor for Treaty Affairs. Since countries on this list are subject to change, refer to the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm. (3) Drug Policy.

(b) National Security Positions ­ All delinquent financial obligations, even those not imposed by law, must be favorably resolved

DJA11RFP0011

Page 11 of 36

through proof of payment, and/or participation in a payment plan, or otherwise resolved. (6) Foreign Nationals Accessing Information Technology Systems. DOJ Order 2640.2F Information Technology Security, states nonU.S. citizens shall not be authorized to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department IT systems.

Contractor employees must personally present two forms of identification in original form prior to accessing ATF information, information technology systems, and/or facilities. At least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID. In the event a contract employee is found to be non-compliant with the agency specific qualifications, PSB will notify the COTR and the CO. The request for investigation will be terminated and the contractor may be requested to submit another name and complete personnel suitability and security package. Additional agency specific qualifications may be implemented without notice to the Contractor. Denial or Disapproval of Access to ATF Information, Information Technology Systems, and/or Facilities In the event that a Contractor employee is denied or disapproved for access to ATF information, information technology systems, and/ or facilities due to issues found during the background investigation, the Personnel Security Branch will notify the COTR and the CO. The contractor may be requested to submit another name and complete personnel suitability and security package. Freedom of Information Act Requests Once a determination has been made by the PSB, a Contractor employee may receive a copy of his/her background investigative file by submitting a written Freedom of Information Act request. The request must be addressed to the Disclosure Division, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, 99 New York Avenue, NE, Suite 1E-400, Washington, DC 20226. It is the responsibility of the Contractor employee to assume all monetary liabilities associated with such request. Police Check Inquiries In those instances where the Contractor believes that its employees will not need unescorted access to ATF facilities, or access to any ATF proprietary information, data or information technology systems, the Contractor shall notify the COTR. The COTR will then apprise ATF's PSB of the Contractor's initial determination, citing the reasons thereof. The PSB, in consultation with the COTR or the CO, will make the final determination as to whether or not the Contractor employee will need to undergo a background investigation. The nature and specific degree of background investigation will be determined by the PSB, depending upon the nature and degree of risk associated with the contract position. When ATF's PSB determines that the Contractor will require escorted access to ATF facilities, and/or ATF construction sites, or will only be provided with access to ATF non-sensitive information, the Contractor employee must undergo a criminal history check. The Physical Security Programs Branch or the respective field division/office is responsible for conducting the criminal history check and making the favorable or unfavorable determination. Access to Classified National Security Information In the event the Contractor employee requires access to classified National Security Information (NSI), in order to fulfill contractual requirements, the COTR or the CO must contact the PSB. The PSB will assess the requirements and make a determination if access to NSI is required at the Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret level (which may or may not include access to Sensitive Compartmented Information. If the PSB determines that access to NSI is required, the contract must be modified to incorporate the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program (NISP). The PSB will provide additional personnel security language to the CO and coordinate all additional personnel security requirements of the NISP with the COTR.

(b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall immediately proceed with the following obligations, regardless of any delay in determining or adjusting any amounts due under this clause: (1) Stop work as specified in the notice. (2) Place no further subcontracts or orders (referred to as subcontracts in this clause) for materials, services, or facilities, except as necessary to complete the continued portion of the contract. (3) Terminate all subcontracts to the extent they relate to the work terminated. (4) Assign to the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer, all right, title, and interest of the Contractor under the subcontracts terminated, in which case the Government shall have the right to settle or to pay any termination settlement proposal arising out of those terminations.

The Contractor may request the Government to remove those items or enter into an agreement for their storage. Within 15 days, the Government will accept title to those items and remove them or enter into a storage agreement. The Contracting Officer may verify the list upon removal of the items, or if stored, within 45 days from submission of the list, and shall correct the list, as necessary, before final settlement.

The Contractor shall submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1 year from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Contractor within this 1-year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that the facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal

Page 23 of 36

If the Contractor fails to submit the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, due the Contractor because of the termination and shall pay the amount determined. (f) Subject to paragraph (e) of this clause, the Contractor and the Contracting Officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount to be paid or remaining to be paid because of the termination. The amount may include a reasonable allowance for profit on work done. However, the agreed amount, whether under this paragraph (g) or paragraph (g) of this clause, exclusive of costs shown in subparagraph (g)(3) of this clause, may not exceed the total contract price as reduced by (1) the amount of payments previously made and (2) the contract price of work not terminated.The contract shall be modified, and the Contractor paid the agreed amount. Paragraph (g) of this clause shall not limit, restrict, or affect the amount that may be agreed upon to be paid under this paragraph. (g) If the Contractor and the Contracting Officer fail to agree on the whole amount to be paid because of the termination of work, the Contracting Officer shall pay the Contractor the amounts determined by the Contracting Officer as follows, but without duplication of any amounts agreed on under paragraph (f) of this clause: (1) The contract price for completed supplies or services accepted by the Government (or sold or acquired under subparagraph (b)(9) of this clause) not previously paid for, adjusted for any saving of freight and other charges. (2) The total of-(i) The costs incurred in the performance of the work terminated, including initial costs and preparatory expense allocable thereto, but excluding any costs attributable to supplies or services paid or to be paid under subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause; (ii) The cost of settling and paying termination settlement proposals under terminated subcontracts that are properly chargeable to the terminated portion of the contract if not included in subdivision (g)(2)(i) of this clause; and (iii) A sum, as profit on subdivision (g)(2)(i) of this clause, determined by the Contracting Officer under 49.202 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, to be fair and reasonable; however, if it appears that the Contractor would have sustained a loss on the entire contract had it been completed, the Contracting Officer shall allow no profit under this subdivision (iii) and shall reduce the settlement to reflect the indicated rate of loss. (3) The reasonable costs of settlement of the work terminated, including-(i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and other expenses reasonably necessary for the preparation of termination settlement proposals and supporting data; (ii) The termination and settlement of subcontracts (excluding the amounts of such settlements); and (iii) Storage, transportation, and other costs incurred, reasonably necessary for the preservation, protection, or disposition of the termination inventory. (h) Except for normal spoilage, and except to the extent that the Government expressly assumed the risk of loss, the Contracting Officer shall exclude from the amounts payable to the Contractor under paragraph (g) of this clause, the fair value, as determined by the Contracting Officer, of property that is destroyed, lost, stolen, or damaged so as to become undeliverable to the Government or to a buyer. (i) The cost principles and procedures of Part 31 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, in effect on the date of this contract, shall govern all costs claimed, agreed to, or determined under this clause. (j) The Contractor shall have the right of appeal, under the Disputes clause, from any determination made by the Contracting Officer under paragraph (e), (g), or (l) of this clause, except that if the Contractor failed to submit the termination settlement proposal or request for equitable adjustment within the time provided in paragraph (e) or (l), respectively, and failed to request a time extension, there is no right of appeal. (k) In arriving at the amount due the Contractor under this clause, there shall be deducted-(1) All unliquidated advance or other payments to the Contractor under the terminated portion of this contract; (2) Any claim which the Government has against the Contractor under this contract; and (3) The agreed price for, or the proceeds of sale of, materials, supplies, or other things acquired by the Contractor or sold under the provisions of this clause and not recovered by or credited to the Government. (l) If the termination is partial, the Contractor may file a proposal with the Contracting Officer for an equitable adjustment of the price(s) of the continued portion of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall make any equitable adjustment agreed upon. Any proposal by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment under this clause shall be requested within 90 days from the effective date of termination unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer. (m) (1) The Government may, under the terms and conditions it prescribes, make partial payments and payments against costs incurred by the Contractor for the terminated portion of the contract, if the Contracting Officer believes the total of these payments will not exceed the amount to which the Contractor will be entitled. (2) If the total payments exceed the amount finally determined to be due, the Contractor shall repay the excess to the Government upon demand, together with interest computed at the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under 50 U.S.C. App. 1215(b)(2). Interest shall be computed for the period from the date the excess payment is received by the Contractor to the date the ex-

DJA11RFP0011

Page 24 of 36

cess is repaid. Interest shall not be charged on any excess payment due to a reduction in the Contractor's termination settlement proposal because of retention or other disposition of termination inventory until 10 days after the date of the retention or disposition, or a later date determined by the Contracting Officer because of the circumstances. (n) Unless otherwise provided in this contract or by statute, the Contractor shall maintain all records and documents relating to the terminated portion of this contract for 3 years after final settlement. This includes all books and other evidence bearing on the Contractor's costs and expenses under this contract. The Contractor shall make these records and documents available to the Government, at the Contractor's office, at all reasonable times, without any direct charge. If approved by the Contracting Officer, photographs, microphotographs, or other authentic reproductions may be maintained instead of original records and documents. (End of clause)

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has __ has not __, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
