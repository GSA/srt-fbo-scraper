PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT - INTEGRATED LIBRARY AUTOMATION SYSTEM

1.0

INTRODUCTION

1.1 The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of the dependents of military and civilian employees by providing PK-12 instruction to approximately 85,000 students in seven states, twelve foreign countries, Guam, and Puerto Rico. The number of students varies based on the deployment of military troops worldwide. DoDEA's curriculum, resources, and student achievement scores on standardized assessments compare favorably to high-performing US public schools 1.2 DoDEA is divided into three administrative areas. DDESS (Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools) covers the schools in seven states and Puerto Rico, and for administrative purposes, Cuba. DoDDS (Department of Defense Dependent Schools) is divided into DoDDS-Europe and DoDDS-Pacific. The former administers the schools in England, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Turkey, and Bahrain. The latter covers the schools in Korea, Japan, and for administrative purposes, Guam. 1.3 In the 2010-11 school year, DoDEA will open a fully accredited virtual high school whose curriculum, instruction and assessment will be comparable or superior in quality to those delivered in DoDEA grade 9-12 classrooms worldwide. The school will be headquartered in Arlington, Virginia and have hubs in the US, Europe, and Pacific. Although some students may be enrolled fulltime in the virtual high school, the majority will use online courses to complement and enhance their regular high school course offerings. 2.0 BACKGROUND

2.1 DoDEA currently has 192 schools, varying greatly in size and grade configuration. Schools currently use stand-alone, automated systems. All sites with over 100 students are staffed by a certified school library information specialist. Each Area office is staffed by Information Specialists who serve as the coordinator for school library information center programs. 3.0 SCOPE

3.1 DoDEA requires a next-generation integrated library automation system to serve the needs of students attending DoDEA's virtual school and K-12 schools located on US military bases worldwide. In the 2010-11 school year DoDEA will have an estimated 195 school sites with anticipated growth of 1-3 sites per year.

HE1254-10-T-0033 Page 17 of 44

3.2 The automation solution may be based upon either (1) a centralized single solution in which all school sites access materials from server(s) located at the headquarters office in Arlington, Virginia or (2) a combination centralized and distributed solution in which all resources/servers(s) may be accessed from the headquarters office in Arlington, Virginia but are distributed from regional server(s) located at the DoDEA Area/regional offices. For example, European schools might access via the Area office server in Wiesbaden Germany; Pacific schools, via Okinawa, Japan; and stateside schools, via Peachtree City, Georgia as long as the Headquarters office can access all automation modules, materials and server(s). 4.0 REQUIREMENTS

4.1 Proven Solution: The Contractor shall provide a proven, effective integrated automation solution which shall be based upon either (1) a centralized single solution in which all school sites access materials from server(s) located at the headquarters office in Arlington, Virginia or (2) a combination centralized and distributed solution in which all resources/servers(s) may be accessed from the headquarters office in Arlington, Virginia but are distributed from regional server(s) located at the DoDEA Area/regional offices. The Contractor is to provide an Integrated Library Automation System that has the following components/capabilities 4.2 Online Public Access Catalog [OPAC]: The automated catalog/OPAC will serve as a Web-accessible portal and delivery mechanism for a variety of standard library materials including books, media, ephemera, Webbased subscription databases, eBooks, audio books, and streaming video. Each school site may not have access to all of these material types at the time of implementation requiring the system to offer the ability to activate/deactivate material types as needed. The automated catalog/OPAC shall be accessible from the any location in the school and remotely. The OPAC will default to the library collection of the specified school and allow any student in that school to search other collections within that particular school district or base complex. The OPAC should include industry standard features as well as the features addressed in this section, under paragraph 4.2.6. 4.2.1 Federated Search: The automated catalog/OPAC will provide industry-standard federated search features to include federated search capabilities across a variety of standard library materials including books, media, ephemera, Web-based subscription databases, cataloged Web sites, eBooks, audio books, and streaming video. Federated search should not be limited to products of partners or subcontractors of the Contractor.  Federated search of Web-based subscription databases will be provided for standard vendors. DoDEA maintains separate contracts for Web-based subscription services that deliver magazines, journals, newspapers, reference books, and curricular material. The current vendors for these services are: Gale/Cengage Learning, Newsbank, and ProQuest. Additional vendors may be added.
