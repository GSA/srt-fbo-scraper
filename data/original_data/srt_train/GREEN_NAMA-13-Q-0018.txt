PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT RECORDS INVENTORY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM

1. General: This is a web-hosting services contract to provide a software as a service (SaaS) solution that provides assistance to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) with records inventory management and records mapping to records retention schedules. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government. 1.1 Description of Services/Introduction: The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform the software as a service webhosting service as defined in this Performance Work Statement. The contractor shall provide an unlimited annual license. The contractor shall provide professional services to include set up, testing of access, and training to users. The initial set up, testing of access, and training will be to approximately 5 users at the National Archives in College Park, MD. The contractor shall also provide set up, testing of access, and training to approximately 300 users at various NARA locations. The contractor will provide estimated travel for 5 days on-site. The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract. 1.2 Background: To comply with statutory responsibilities for Federal records management, NARA employs the use of internal Retention Schedules. Some offices in NARA maintain their own separate file plan in Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel describing the inventory of their records. Other offices have file plans that are out of date and some have none at all. NARA uses the internal Retention Schedules to determine the length of time to keep their records. This approach sometimes results in the duplication of records, inconsistent scheduling of similar records, and potential spoliation of records that may be either incorrectly scheduled or not scheduled at all. Additionally, because there is no integrated approach to the inventory of NARA records, there are internal Retention Schedules that are in various states of completion and maturity. Instead of the approach described above, the Corporate Records Management Office (CM) would like to use a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) software product that is designed to allow users in multiple functional areas to enter and track a records inventory within the software product's user interface, and help with retention
3

NAMA-13-Q-0018

management. The software product will be used as a Records and Information Management Inventory System (RIMIS). RIMIS will have a database that will help to alleviate the data management burden of collecting and managing NARA's entire records inventory, and lead to consistent data and nomenclature. RIMIS will also have a search and view capability, allowing potentially any member of the NARA organization to view the records inventory and the mappings to the internal Records Schedules. This will allow retention rules to be consistent across the entire organization. The methodology used in conjunction with the tool will be to use NARA's Information Management Officers (IMOs) and Records Custodians (RCs) to identify their records and to document their various attributes using RIMIS's capabilities. Once this inventory data is collected, retention rules will be developed at a functional level and each inventory item will be mapped to the applicable retention rule. This mapping will be stored in the software tool database so that retention will be consistent across the enterprise. This methodology embraces both the "big bucket" approach to retention and the application of retention to departmental inventories/record series. RIMIS can also provide comprehensive documentation of all activities, changes and updates to NARA records inventory, and storage of the information in one place. 1.3 Objectives: The service objective is to purchase a web-based softwareas-a-service (SaaS) solution for Records Inventory, Records Mapping to a retention rule, and retention module for the development, deployment, and tracking of the retention rule(s). We will also purchase consulting and training services to configure the software, and train designated NARA staff regarding the use of the software. We provide the requirements for the software below: 1. Software shall provide the ability for 300 or more users to enter data for inventory of NARA records. 2. Software shall contain a library of baseline general records that a Government agency can use as a starting point to create an inventory. 3. Software shall provide for the ability to create a retention schedule or retention schedules. 4. Software shall provide for the development and deployment of "big bucket" or large aggregation retention rules. 5. Software shall be able to be set up to allow each inventory entry to be mapped to a NARA developed retention rule for information governance purposes. 6. Software shall allow tracking of updates to the inventory, mapping of records to rules, and deletion of records. 7. Software shall allow tracking of rules approval and retention rules.
4

NAMA-13-Q-0018

8. Software shall have reporting capability, especially on location of records in the organization. 9. Software shall have an enterprise search feature that can allow every employee to know what information exists and where, and how to manage it in full compliance with retention rules or information security classification 10. Software will have an export capability so that NARA can export their data in an open (non-proprietary) format for use in other applications. 1.4 Scope: The contractor shall provide a web-based software-as-a-service solution with software described in the requirements above to be accessed by NARA staff. The contractor shall provide assistance with the configuration of the software through faceto-face consulting services, and face-to-face training of designated staff in NARA on the use of the software as a service. The contractor shall provide off-site technical support after completion of configuration of software and training. 1.5 Period of Performance: The period of performance shall be for one (1) Base Period of 12 months and three (3) 12-month option periods. The Period of Performance reads as follows: Base Period (12 months) Option Period I (12 months) Option Period II (12 months) Option Period III (12 months) 1.6 General Information

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit.

(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor-- (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

43

NAMA-13-Q-0018

(a) Contractor personnel designated to receive an ID/Building Pass will be subjected to NACI background investigation and must be approved in accordance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and OMB guidance M-05-24. (b) The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that each of its employees performing work under this contract display their photo-identification badges at all times they are present on-duty in the building. Refusal or repeated neglect to display the photo-identification may result in an unsuitable determination. (c) Upon termination, resignation or other event leading to a contract employee leaving duty under this contract, the Contractor is responsible for returning all Government identification, building passes, keys, and other Government property issued to that employee. Failure on the part of the Contractor may result in the Contractor's liability for all costs associated with correcting the resultant breech in building security. (d) The Contractor shall notify the COR when the employee badges are lost. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to pay for replacement badges at the current replacement cost per badge. (e) The requirements of this clause are applicable to and shall be flowed down to all subcontractors who will work at the Archives facility(ies). 2. Physical Access Suitability (a) The Government will have, and will exercise, full and complete control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating suitability determinations for all contract employees granted access to Government facilities.

Contractor personnel with access to NARA Desktop Common Productivity Tools shall also be required to comply with this
62

NAMA-13-Q-0018

requirement. The Government may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and grant temporary access to employees of the Contractor and its subcontractors. However, the granting of temporary access to any such employee will not be considered as assurance that full suitability determination will follow as a result or condition thereof. The granting of either temporary or full access will in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such suitability determination by the Government as deemed necessary to protect facilities. (b) Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor must submit to the COR, as soon as possible, but not later than ten (10) working days before contract performance is required to begin, one (1) completed Form FD 258, Fingerprint Chart; one (1) background investigation form (SF 85, SF-85-P or SF-86, as applicable)((this may be through e-QIP system with prior coordination with the NARA Personnel Security Office); one (1) Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification; and one (1) Declaration for Federal Employment, Optional Form 306 (OF 306) for those officers of the firm who may visit the worksite during the period of this contract and for all employees who have access to the buildings in the performance of the contract work. These forms must be submitted for replacement employees (10) days before entrance on duty. The Government will be responsible for processing these forms and adjudicating the results of the investigations. If the Government receives an unsuitable report on any employee after processing these forms, the Contractor will be advised immediately that such employee cannot continue to work, or be assigned to work, under this contract. Contractors, who hire employees investigated and determined suitable during employment with preceding Contractors, are not required to submit another set of these forms, if the employee has been determined suitable within the past three (3) years, unless specifically requested to do so by the COR. (c) During the course of this contract, regardless of where the work is being performed, in a NARA facility or another location authorized by the contract, the Contractor may come into contact with data files subject to the Privacy Act. If this situation occurs, Privacy Act data must conform to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended. The Contractor also may come into contact with sensitive documents and sensitive information about documents and proposed Federal Agency actions. The Contractor, including Contractor's personnel, Subcontractors, and consultants must not divulge or release data or information developed or obtained in performance of this task except to authorized Government personnel or upon written approval of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor must not use, disclose, or reproduce proprietary data, which bears a restrictive legend, other than as required in the performance of this task. The limitations above do not apply to data or information that has been made public by the Government. (d) If Contractor Personnel have a completed NACI from another Federal Agency, verification of the completed NACI must be forwarded to the NARA Personnel Security Officer. This may require obtaining a copy of the completed
63

NAMA-13-Q-0018

investigation. If Contractor Personnel possess a National Security Clearance through another Federal Agency, the granting agency must provide verification of the Clearance to the NARA Personnel Security Officer. A National Security Clearance shall suffice in the event the personnel are performing work at NARA that only requires an investigation below that required for a National Security Clearance. (e) The requirements of this clause are applicable to, and must flow down, to all subcontractors who will work at NARA facility(ies).

BuyAccessible Government Product / Service Accessibility Template (GPAT)
  Section 508 (http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=policies)requires that federal agencies electronic and information technology is accessible to people with disabilities. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology.   Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) (http://section508.gov/index.cfm? fuseAction=1998Amend) are determined as applicable to this acquisition based on the following technical provisions: To understand the technical standards that apply to each provision, the respondent should refer to http://Section 508.gov at http://section508.gov/index.cfm? fuseAction=stdsdoc.   This GPAT is a simple tool to assist Federal contracting and procurement officials in fulfilling the market research requirements associated with Section 508 regulations. The GPAT is intended as a form to be included with government solicitations, to be filled out by solicitation respondents as a part of their proposal to indicate how their proposed solution addresses the applicable Section 508 requirements.   NOTE: Section 508 provisions are determined to apply based in part on EIT requirements characterized using the BuyAccessible Wizard. Provisions based on definite EIT requirements are identified by a "yes" in the Applicable column. Provisions based on possible EIT requirements are identified by a "maybe" in the Applicable column. Provisions not identified with program requirements for this acquisition have no entry in the Applicable column. However, if your product or service deliverable has physical or functional characteristics corresponding to any of the listed EIT accessibility requirements, even those beyond identified program requirements, then the requirement applies and you should provide appropriate accessibility information.   The GPAT is organized as a series of ten tables. The first eight tables reflect accessibility information about EIT products, corresponding to the six technical sections, the functional performance criteria, and the requirements for information, documentation, and support as defined in the Access Board Standard for Section 508. The ninth and tenth tables correspond to accessibility information about information content deliverables and labor hours, respectively.   Please fill the information below as a part of request for accessibility information of your proposed deliverable.
