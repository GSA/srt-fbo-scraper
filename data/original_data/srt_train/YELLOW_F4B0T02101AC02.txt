Provisions and Clauses
The provision at FAR 52.212-3 Alt I, Offeror Representations and Certifications Â­ Commercial Items (Apr 2012), must be completed. Offerors are highly encouraged to complete all representations and certifications electronically on line at (http://orca.bpn.gov/publicsearch.aspx). If not completed online, 52.212-3 Alt I shall be completed in hard copy and submitted with quote. In accordance with FAR 52.212-4(t), Central Contractor Registration (CCR) contractors must be registered with CCR to conduct business with the Department of Defense. No purchase order can be awarded to any company without this registration. (www.ccr.gov) The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Award will be made on the basis of determining the technically acceptable offer with the lowest evaluated price which meets or exceeds the minimum requirement. Quotations will first be ordered by price. The offer with the lowest price will then be

evaluated to determine the "technical capability" of the product and "how well the proposed

products meet the Government requirement". The government may find an offeror's software or solution unacceptable if it does not meet the minimum requirements in the PWS. At a minimum the government will evaluate the offer based on the following technical criteria on an
acceptable/unacceptable basis: 1. Ability of the offered application to allow the EEH user to generate reports and queries as defined in the PWS. 2. Ability of the offered application to allow the EEH user to create, add, delete, and manipulate event hosting registration fields, data fields, nomenclature, and format based on each event. 3. Ability of the offered application to allow the EEH user to easily build a customized website consistent with USAFA branding. 4. Offeror's ability to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 5. Past performance based on information obtained through the Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at www.ppirs.gov. The offeror with the lowest price that has been determined to be technically acceptable based on the evaluation criteria will be awarded the contract. If the lowest priced offer passes all technical criteria, award will be made to that offeror and no further evaluations will take place. If the lowest priced offer does not pass all technical criteria, the next lowest offer will be evaluated for technical acceptability and if required, the process will continue until an offer passes technical acceptability of all criteria.

Countering the Threat. 4.7.1 USAFA networks have controlled network traffic. The contractor shall work closely with USAFA's IT personnel to ensure service is accessible by authorized government personnel.

The contractor shall demonstrate this capability at the CDR. The Government will designate certain EEH solution users who are able to access all government data on the EEH solution. The Government will designate other users as basic administrators who do not have unrestricted access. The contractor shall create administrative capacity in the EEH solution such that administrators can be changed throughout the duration of the contract. There are approximately 75-100 personnel who may need to access reports and only about six who may need access to the most sensitive information. The EEH solution shall accommodate administrators with one login and password for all web site functions. The data field changes/updates shall display to the super administrator who made the change along with the date and time of the change. USAFA data and EEH solution shall be protected by fire detection and suppression systems by the contractor. Systems shall be fault tolerant with redundant servers and hourly back-ups.
